environmental protection 

as responsible stewards of people and communities natural resources and capital stewardship is one of the companys core values its vision 2030 goals provide a framework to build a better future for people the planet and the company in the areas of healthy and abundant forests thriving people and communities sustainable operations and renewable solutions through these efforts and more the company tackles the toughest issues in the value chain to improve its environmental footprint and promote the longterm sustainability of natural capital 

as part of its business the company is subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment for example company manufacturing processes involve discharges to water air emissions water intake and waste handling and disposal activities all of which are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations along with requirements of environmental 

permits or analogous authorizations issued by various governmental authorities in addition new environmental laws or regulations impacting our facilities around the world are routinely passed or proposed our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent approximately 34 million in 2021 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend 37 million in 2022 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures on environmental projects for 2023 and 2024 respectively are anticipated to be approximately 45 million and 35 million it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects or changes in environmental laws and regulations 

the company has completed capital projects to meet the us environmental protection agencys epa maximum achievable control technology mact and risk and technology review rtr regulations that require owners of specified pulp and paper process equipment and boilers to meet new air emissions standards for certain substances as portions of these mact and rtr regulations have been remanded to epa for further consideration it is not clear at this time what if any additional capital project expenditures might result from resolution of the open issues 

the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many prps there are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company’s current closed or formerlyowned facilities and recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet for additional information regarding certain remediation actions see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data on pages 70 through 74 for additional information regarding risks associated with environmental matters see item 1a risk factors – we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other governmental requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations 

climate change 

the company recognizes the impacts of climate change on people and our planet in order to manage climaterelated risks we are taking actions throughout our value chain to help advance a lowcarbon economy we also intend to align our annual sustainability reporting with the recommendations of the task force on climaterelated financial disclosure tcfd beginning with the 2022 reporting cycle based upon data from 2021 

we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day this cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly 

managed forests and recycled raw materials to create our products we then use a circular manufacturing process that makes the most of resources and byproducts while reducing the environmental impacts of our operations at the end of use the majority of our lowcarbon products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material we work to advance the shift to a lowcarbon circular economy by designing products that are 100 reusable recyclable or compostable 

through improvements in operations equipment energy efficiency and fuel diversity we have achieved significant companywide reductions in scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example we reduced our ghg emissions by approximately 20 between 2010 and 2020 moreover as part of our vision 2030 goals we have targeted incremental reductions of 35 in our scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions in comparison to 2019 levels in december 2021 the science based targets initiative sbti approved these targets as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the paris agreement an agreement signed among over 170 countries which became effective in november 2016 and to which the united states formally rejoined in february 2021 we intend to continue to evaluate and implement projects as we pursue this vision 2030 ghg goal this includes ongoing energy efficiency efforts and capital projects to phase out our most carbon intensive fuel sources scope 1 as well as developing ghg reduction strategies for our energy sourcing scope 2 and broader supply chain footprint scope 3 

we use carbonneutral biomass and manufacturing residuals rather than fossil fuels to generate a majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills we believe our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests 

international efforts 

the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and compels international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of ghgs consistent with this objective participating countries aim to balance ghg emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or in effect achieve netzero global ghg emissions 

to assist member countries in meeting ghg reduction obligations the eu operates an emissions trading system eu ets our operations in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to 

the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreements nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

us efforts including state regional and local measures 

responses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing ghg emissions come into effect the epa manages regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations and iv require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year 

several us states including states in which we operate facilities have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities california new york and virginia have already enacted such programs although these regulations have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the company we monitor proposed programs in other states as well however it is unclear what impacts if any future statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

summary 

regulation related to ghgs and climate change continues to evolve in the areas of the world in which we do business however while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change in the future it is unclear what actions will be taken and when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate the company’s costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on the company such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects the company has controls and procedures in place to track ghg emissions from our facilities as well as to stay informed about developments concerning possible climaterelated laws regulations accords and policies in the us and in other jurisdictions where we operate we regularly assess whether such developments may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

moreover compliance with legal requirements related to ghgs andor climate change which are currently in effect or may be enacted in the future may require future expenditures to meet ghg emission reduction obligations these obligations may include carbon taxes the requirement to purchase ghg credits or the need to acquire carbon offsets we may also incur significant expenditures in relation to our efforts to meet our internal targets or goals with respect to ghgs and climate change including our vision 2030 goal on ghgs as set forth above furthermore in connection with complying with legal requirements andor our efforts to meet our internal targets and goals we have made and expect to continue to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels such as fuel oil and coal with lower carbon alternatives such as biomass and natural gas currently these efforts and obligations have not materially impacted the company but such efforts and obligations may have a material impact on the company in the future 

we believe global citizenship is a key element of corporate governance promoted by our board of directors and senior management the public policy and environment committee of the board has overall responsibility for global citizenship at the company this committee reviews and assesses environmental sustainability including climate change public policy legal health and safety and technology issues the company’s governance committee also has oversight of certain public policy and sustainability matters

 item 1a risk factors 

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance the board of directors exercises oversight of the company’s enterprise risk management program which includes strategic operational and financial matters as well as compliance and legal risks the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board’s standing committees and management and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the 

company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs our business results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forwardlooking statements we make in any public disclosures 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business and may have material adverse effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly if public health andor global economic conditions associated with covid19 persist or deteriorate during 2021 there continued to be a large number of covid19 cases and deaths in the united states and throughout the world and restrictive measures including mask and vaccine requirements were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses economic recovery in the united states and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse public health impacts of covid19 and other factors 

most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational while we have been able to manage through the worst of the pandemic to date there remain many unknowns about the future phases of the pandemic any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills plants or other facilities as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

our operations have recently experienced and may continue to experience supply chain constraints and disruptions higher supply chain costs and a constrained transportation environment due in part to the impacts of covid19 moreover due to the competitive labor market we have experienced and may continue to experience a shortage of labor for certain positions and increased labor costs 

in addition to these higher costs other potential negative impacts on our business include but are not limited to the following 

• we rely on a global workforce and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees customers and others with whom we do business while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations during the pandemic we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness quarantines vaccine or test mandates government actions or other restrictions or measures enacted in response to the pandemic 

• a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements including due to increased cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure 

while we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business the extent of the impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial performance as well as our ability to execute nearterm and longterm business strategies and initiatives will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control and some of which we are not currently aware including but not limited to a the duration severity and scope of the pandemic including the potential for additional variants including potential variants that may be more resistant to currently available vaccines waves increases and spikes in the number of covid19 cases in various areas from time to time b governmental and public health directives andor actions taken by our customers vendors and other private businesses generally including vaccine testing and mask requirements to contain and combat the outbreak including the duration degree and effectiveness of such requirements as well as the easing removal and potential reinstitution of such requirements c the availability acceptance effectiveness and administration of medical treatments vaccines and booster shots for covid19 d the extent and duration of the pandemic’s impact on economic conditions and social activity including with respect to 

inflationary pressures supply chain shortages and disruptions consumer confidence discretionary spending and preferences labor market conditions labor and healthcare costs and unemployment rates any of which may adversely impact our business and e any temporary reduction in our workforce closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations 

the pandemic has had and we expect the pandemic to continue to have an adverse effect on portions of our business moreover the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition if public health andor global economic conditions persist or deteriorate 

risks related to climate and weather 

we are subject to physical operational transitional and financial risks associated with climate change and global regional and local weather conditions as well as by legal regulatory and market responses to climate change climate change impacts including rising temperatures and the increasing severity andor frequency of adverse weather conditions may result in operational impacts on our facilities supply chain disruptions and increased raw material and other costs these adverse weather conditions and other physical impacts which may be exacerbated as the result of climate change include floods hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes hailstorms wildfires snow ice storms drought the spread of disease and insect infestations climate change may also contribute to the decreased productivity of forests and adverse impacts on the distribution and abundance of species the spread of disease and insect epidemics any of which developments could adversely affect timber harvesting the effects of climate change and global regional and local weather conditions including the resulting financial costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business 

there has been an increased focus including from investors the general public and us and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities regarding environmental social and governance esg matters including with respect to climate change ghg emissions packaging and waste sustainable supply chain practices deforestation and land energy and water use this increased awareness with respect to esg matters including climate change may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to esg metrics an expectation that such metrics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours and increased 

pressure to make commitments set targets or establish goals and take action to meet them as the result of this increased focus and our commitment to esg matters we have voluntarily provided disclosure and established targets and goals with respect to various esg matters including climate change for example we have made public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions including our vision 2030 goal of reducing scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions by 35 and establishing sciencebased targets to reduce those emissions meeting these and other esg targets and goals have increased and may continue to increase our capital and operational costs further there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which our climate and other esg targets will be achieved and the achievement of these targets is subject to various risks and uncertainties some of which are outside our control moreover there is no assurance that investments made in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or nonbinding legal standards regarding sustainability performance if we are unable to meet these climate and other esg targets and goals this failure could adversely impact our reputation as well as investor customer and other stakeholder relationships which could adversely impact our business and results of operations moreover not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other esg targets and goals at a comparable level to ours which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for competitors 

other climaterelated business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy such as increased prices for fuels the introduction of a carbon tax increased regulations and more stringent andor complex environmental and other permitting requirements to the extent that climaterelated business risks materialize particularly if we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs and our business may be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda starch and adhesives energy sources principally biomass natural gas electricity and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by factors such as trade policies between countries individual governments legislation and 

regulations and changes in the global economy in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for thirdparty transportation we have recently experienced and may continue to experience a significant increase in various costs including recycled fiber energy freight and other supply chain costs in addition because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the costs of any raw materials energy sources or transportation sources through price increases to our customers our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products due to factors such as economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes moreover consumer preferences are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions these consumer preferences may affect the prices of our products consequently our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products in addition our results may be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences and technological and regulatory developments 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies additional manufacturing capacity marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or 

achieved by competitors and the entry of new competitors in to the markets we serve could negatively impact our financial results in addition our products also compete in some instances with companies in other industries that produce substitutes for woodfiber products such as plastics and various types of metal and customer shifts away from woodfiber products toward such substitute products may adversely affect our business 

risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our business we may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events including future health epidemics or pandemics natural disasters geopolitical events terrorism political financial or social instability or civil or social unrest moreover negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material volatility or uncertainty in the financial capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in international conditions or other risks arising from conducting business internationally could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products these risks which can vary substantially by country may include economic or political instability geopolitical events such as increasing tensions between ukraine and russia corruption antiamerican sentiment social and ethnic unrest the regulatory environment including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar repatriating cash from foreign countries to the united states downturns or changes in economic activity including in relation to commodity inflation adverse tax consequences or 

rulings nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries likewise disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries such as in relation to the trade tensions between the united states and china which can result in tariffs could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders 

in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad and the us department of treasury’s office of foreign asset control and other nonus government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries persons and entities failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business as of december 31 2021 international paper had approximately 56 billion of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

• it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital capital expenditures product development dividends share repurchases debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

• a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including operations capital 

expenditures and future business opportunities 

• the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations 

• it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions including to react to rising interest rates and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and 

• it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth 

in addition we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives moreover the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted additionally despite these restrictions we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above 

moreover certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offering rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate in march 2021 the uk financial conduct authority announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31 2021 for sterling euro swiss franc and japanese yen settings as well as the oneweek and twomonth us dollar settings and immediately after june 30 2023 for the remaining us dollar settings in instances where we have not yet incorporated liborreplacement provisions into our variable rate debt provisions that use libor as an interest rate benchmark we will need to do so before june 30 2023 the discontinuation and replacement of libor 

or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets additionally uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation and replacement including that any benchmark may not be the economic equivalent of libor or not achieve market acceptance similar to libor may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 10 billion of our debt as of december 31 2021 the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes including those delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 

2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 487 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 15 variable interest entities  on pages 74 through 75 and note 13  income taxes  on pages 68 through 70 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 or later for certain acquired populations as described in note 19 retirement plans  on pages 80 through 86 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and substantially all hourly union and nonunion employees regardless of hire date the company froze participation under these plans for us salaried employees including credited service and compensation on or after january 1 2019 however the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31 2018 we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual market returns on plan assets changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs however the impact of market fluctuations has been reduced as a result of investments in our pension plan asset portfolio which partially hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on the plan’s funded status drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes health care utilization by participants and potential changes in legal requirements and government oversight 

our us funded pension plans are currently fully funded on a projected benefit obligation basis however the possibility exists that over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record an asset or a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the surplus of the fair value of plan assets above the benefit obligation or the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets at december 31 2021 we had an overfunded pension asset balance the benefit surplus recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2021 was 242 million the amount and timing of future contributions which could be material will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

• fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other catastrophes including adverse weather conditions which may be intensified by climate change 

• the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply 

• the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities 

• disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs 

• terrorism or threats of terrorism 

• information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes including cyberattacks 

• domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners including joint venture partners around the world 

• unscheduled maintenance outages 

• prolonged power failures 

• an equipment failure 

• a chemical spill or release 

• explosion of a boiler or other equipment 

• damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities 

• disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads bridges railroad tracks and tunnels 

• a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease such as the outbreak of the covid19 virus or any other public health crisis 

• failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms 

• labor difficulties and 

• other operational problems 

any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit we have a 50 equity interest in ilim sa whose primary operations are in russia in joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and 

making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions joint ventures divestitures spinoffs capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures spinoffs capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits from such transactions this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than we do 

corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above the focus of our management’s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations the demands on our financial operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions 

we believe that the spinoff of sylvamo corporation allows us and sylvamo corporation to pursue distinct strategies appropriate to our respective markets however there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the expected strategic financial operational or other benefits of the spinoff a failure to realize expected benefits of the spinoff could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that sylvamo corporation will be successful as a standalone entity in the event that sylvamo corporation is not successful it is possible that plaintiffs could assert a variety of claims against us depending on their nature and number such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we account for certain investments including our investment in sylvamo corporation on a marktomarket basis and as a result changes in the fair value of these investments could significantly impact our reported results 

we could be exposed to claims from sylvamo corporation under our agreements with sylvamo corporation or otherwise we have entered into agreements with sylvamo corporation and its subsidiaries including among others a separation and distribution agreement registration rights agreement transition services agreement tax matters agreement supply and offtake agreements intellectual property agreements and other commercial arrangements our agreements with sylvamo corporation or its subsidiaries may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated parties and in certain instances may relate to the continuation of certain business arrangements among us and sylvamo corporation in existence prior to the spinoff such agreements include among other things the parties’ respective indemnification rights and obligations with respect to certain losses relating to specified liabilities as well as certain losses relating to specified information included in certain securities filings the allocations of assets and liabilities payment obligations and other obligations between us and sylvamo corporation there can be no assurance that any remedies available under these arrangements will be sufficient to compensate us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance in addition there can be no assurance that the attention we must pay and resources we must devote to our obligations under one or more of these agreements or the results of any failure to perform those obligations or successful claim by sylvamo corporation that we have failed to perform those obligations or have an indemnification obligation under these agreements will not have a material impact on our own business performance results of operations or financial condition 

we will rely on sylvamo corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements entered into in connection with the spinoff if sylvamo corporation fails to satisfy such obligations it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under the tax matters agreement we could have significant payment obligations in connection with certain brazilian tax matters under this agreement we have agreed to pay 60 of the first 300 million of any liability resulting from the resolution of these brazilian tax matters with sylvamo paying the remaining 40 of any such liability and 100 of any liability resulting from the brazilian tax matters over 300 million the assessments for the tax years 2007  2015 currently total approximately 106 million in tax and 351 million in interest penalties and fees as of december 31 2021 adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for furthe r information  

we operate in a challenging market for talent and may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel including key management personnel our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities produce our products and serve our customers the market for both hourly workers and professional workers has been and remains very competitive particularly for employees with specialized technical and trade experience for example due to labor market constraints we have recently had to increase overtime while we try to hire additional permanent employees this along with the current competitive labor market has led to higher labor costs particularly at our converting facilities moreover despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances we experienced attrition rates within our workforce in 2021 that exceeded historical levels in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively the loss of key executive and management employees particularly in a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees could adversely affect our business 

moreover changing demographics and labor work force trends including remote work expectations for many individuals arising from the covid19 pandemic may make it difficult for us to replace retiring or departing employees if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we continue to experience excessive turnover we may continue to experience higher labor costs and labor shortages and our business may be adversely impacted moreover labor shortages may be further exacerbated by covid19 vaccination and testing requirements 

in addition a significant number of our employees are represented by unions we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts once our current contracts with unions expire without work stoppages or labor difficulties or we may be unable renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms we have also experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future moreover labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if unions are able to organize additional groups of our employees our operating costs increase and our operational flexibility could be reduced 

we are subject to cybersecurity and information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes our business operations rely upon securely managed information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting we have invested in information technology security initiatives and information technology risk management as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring testing and updating as technologies and processes change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated 

the current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies including those in our industry like other global companies our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information manipulate data or disrupt our operations and we have experienced cyber threats and incidents although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyberattacks such as ransomware and data theft by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or social activist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events in addition the cybersecurityrelated threats that we face may remain undetected for an extended 

period of time network system application and data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents could result in operational disruptions data loss or manipulation or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with the company access to applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption any significant cybersecurity incident or operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns and have a material effect on our business additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax trade and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products or subjecting us to increased costs 

for example as part of our business we are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws governing the protection of the environment we have incurred significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations in addition new environmental laws regulations or 

other requirements including with respect to ghg emissions or climate change may cause us to incur increased and unexpected compliance costs moreover there has historically been a lack of consistent climate legislation which has created and continues to create economic and regulatory uncertainty our environmental expenditures include among other areas those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party moreover we may be directly impacted by and are working to manage the risks and costs to us our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change ghgs and the availability of energy and water resources these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands which are a key resource in the production of our products increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury and reputational harm as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

our global operations subject us to complex and evolving us and international data privacy laws and regulations such as european’s union general data protection regulation “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” and the california privacy rights act cpra and china’s personal information protection law “pipl” which came into effect as of november 1 2021 these laws require the company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data there are significant penalties for noncompliance including monetary fines disruption of operations and reputational harm moreover other states and governmental authorities around the world have introduced or passed or are consider enacting similar legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection use and processing activities 

this increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may require changes to our business practices and give rise to significantly expanded compliance burdens costs and enforcement risks moreover many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims changes to our business practices data processing and security systems penalties increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses these laws often provide for civil penalties for violations as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation the company proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and where necessary modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws nevertheless relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws which could subject us to penalties andor litigation in addition there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security and the policies procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper handling of disclosure of or access to personal data improper handling and disclosure of or access to personal data in violation of the gdpr pipl the ccpa andor of other data privacy and protection laws could harm our reputation cause loss of consumer confidence subject us to government enforcement actions including fines or result in private litigation against us which could result in loss of revenue increased costs liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results 

we are subject to taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions and changes in laws regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our financial results in addition the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities additionally administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently 

we are currently subject to tax audits in the us and other taxing jurisdictions around the world in some 

cases we have appealed and may continue to appeal assessments by taxing authorities in the court system as such tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses accelerated cash tax payments higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties for example the 2015 timber monetization restructuring is currently under internal revenue service examination an unfavorable resolution in such current examination future administrative procedures or future tax litigation could result in material accelerated cash tax payments as a result of all or a portion of the remaining 813 million deferred tax liability relating to the timber monetization becoming payable see note 15 variable interest entities for more detail on the timber monetization and the 2015 restructuring 

as such tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results we are a party to various legal regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters including with respect to environmental matters in addition we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate to past present and future facts events circumstances and occurrences should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary d ata for further information 

if the spinoff of sylvamo corporation were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then international paper and our shareholders may be subject to significant us federal income taxes the company received an opinion of tax counsel and a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service the “irs” regarding the qualification of the spinoff of sylvamo corporation and certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree to sylvamo corporation the company and the shareholders of the company for us federal income tax purposes a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position in addition the 

company’s tax counsel and the irs relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by the company and sylvamo corporation in rendering such opinion and private letter ruling if any of the representations or covenants relied upon for the tax opinion or private letter ruling become inaccurate incomplete or not complied with by the company sylvamo corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries the tax opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

if the irs ultimately determines that the spinoff is taxable then the spinoff could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the company’s shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and the company could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities these income tax liabilities may be indemnifiable by sylvamo corporation pursuant to a tax matters agreement between the company and sylvamo however there can be no assurance that sylvamo would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify the company for any such tax liability 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 355 of the code the spinoff may be taxable to the company but not the shareholders of the company pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or more by vote or value change in ownership of either the company or sylvamo corporation directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff for this purpose any acquisitions of the company’s or sylvamo corporation’s common stock within two years before or after the spinoff are presumed to be part of such a plan although the company or sylvamo corporation may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a “safe harbor” described in the us tax regulations

executive summary 

fullyear 2021 net earnings attributable to shareholders were 18 billion 447 per diluted share compared with 482 million 122 per diluted share for fullyear 2020 

during 2021 international paper grew revenue and earnings while managing through significant operational and supply chain constraints we serviced strong customer demand in a highly challenging operating environment due to continued uncertainties associated with covid19 for much of 2021 we operated with a suboptimized system which limited our ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong demand backdrop we made strong progress on price realization from prior increases to mitigate the impact of substantial cost pressure from inputs and distribution we generated fullyear cash from operations of 20 billion and free cash flow of 15 billion which included approximately 500 million of tax payments associated with various asset monetization transactions completed in 2021 as well as payment of deferred payroll taxes under 

the 2020 cares act in 2021 we further strengthened our balance sheet reducing debt by 25 billion additionally our us qualified pension plan has a 105 funded status with a surplus of 600 million as of december 31 2021 lastly we returned 16 billion to shareowners including about 810 million in share repurchases 

in 2021 we announced the companys building a better ip initiative to drive value creation by streamlining and simplifying the company increasing efficiency and reducing costs and accelerating profitable growth to that end in 2021 we further focused our portfolio around corrugated packaging with the spinoff of the printing papers business as a standalone public company sylvamo corporation and we initiated meaningful actions to materially lower our cost structure and accelerate profitable growth with a commitment to deliver 350 to 430 million of incremental earnings in 2024 

comparing our 2021 results to 2020 price and mix improved with strong price realization across all of our business segments and channels mix was also favorable driven by solid growth in highermargin us packaging channels and lower containerboard exports volume was essentially flat versus the prior year as significant operational and supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefits of a solid demand backdrop this was particularly the case in the fourth quarter 2021 as volume improved less than we anticipated primarily due to significant covid19 omicron variant related labor and supply chain constraints late in the quarter especially in our us box system our north american industrial packaging business operated with depleted inventories throughout much of 2021 which increased costs across our system across the company supply chain operating costs increased significantly versus 2020 representing more than half of the increase in operations and costs in 2021 the second half of 2021 was especially challenging due to slow supply chain velocity and poor logistics reliability putting additional cost pressure on our manufacturing systems maintenance outage costs increased as planned following deferrals we chose to make in 2020 input costs rose sharply across most categories with costs increasing throughout 2021 resulting in significantly elevated input cost levels exiting 2021 interest expense was substantially lower in 2021 benefiting from significant debt reduction in 2020 and 2021 although corporate expenses were lower there was some offset in the fourth quarter 2021 related to expected dissynergies following the spinoff of the printing papers business equity earnings improved on strong performance from our ilim joint venture partially offset by reduced earnings from graphic packaging following the final 

monetization of our investment in the first half of 2021 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter 2021 in our industrial packaging business we expect to realize gains related to the august 2021 published price movement volume is expected to be lower in the first quarter 2022 on decreased seasonal demand and the impact of the covid19 omicron variant on labor availability and supply chains although we do expect improvement as the first quarter progresses operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings including additional costs related to the prattville mill recovery and startup costs following the failure of the highdensity storage tank in the fourth quarter 2021 maintenance outage expense is expected to be significantly higher as the first quarter will be our highest outage quarter this year representing about 40 of total planned outage costs in 2022 input costs are expected to improve on lower recovered fiber and energy costs in global cellulose fibers we expect our price and mix combined to be stable we expect volume to decrease moderately due to ongoing vessel delays operations and costs are expected to increase related to higher seasonal costs and the nonrepeat of a favorable lifo benefit in the fourth quarter 2021 maintenance outage expense is expected to increase as the first quarter 2022 will also be global cellulose fibers highest maintenance outage quarter in 2022 input costs are expected to be slightly higher due mostly to higher energy costs lastly equity earnings from the ilim joint venture are expected to improve 

looking to fullyear 2022 year we expect a solid demand environment for corrugated packaging and pulp with demand growth normalizing as we recover from the nearterm covid19 omicron constraints we also expect to make good progress on our building a better ip initiatives which will ramp up as the year progresses we are well positioned to optimize our containerboard mill and corrugated box system following various disruptions in 2021 which will further improve our operating and distributions costs with respect to our capital allocation we are targeting capital expenditures of 11 billion the planned increase is driven primarily by investments in our packaging business to build out capabilities and capacity in our box system to drive profitable growth additionally we are committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a payout of 40 to 50 of free cash flow which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow with regard to share repurchases as of the end of 2021 we had 29 billion of available authorizations we will continue to execute on these authorizations in a manner that balances the investment needs of the business and maximizes value for our shareowners 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide during 2021 there continued to be a large number of covid19 cases and deaths in the united states and throughout the world and restrictive measures including masks and vaccine requirements were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses economic recovery in the united states and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse effects of covid19 and other factors most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational the health and safety of our employees and contractors is our most important responsibility as we manage through the covid19 pandemic we have implemented worksystems across the company to maintain the health and safety of our employees including social distancing site cleaning contract tracing and other measures as recommended by the cdc and who 

the pandemic has not had a material impact on demand for our products however all of our operations continue to experience higher supply chain costs and a constrained transportation environment due in part to the impacts of covid19 moreover due to the competitive labor market we have experienced and may continue to experience a shortage of labor for certain positions and increased labor costs 

there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic as detailed under risks related to the covid19 pandemic on page 8 to 19 of item 1a risk factors  the impacts of the pandemic had an adverse effect on our operations in 2021 and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if public health andor global economic conditions deteriorate 

adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are nongaap measures and are defined as net earnings loss attributable to international paper a gaap measure excluding discontinued operations net special items and nonoperating pension expense income net earnings loss and diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of discontinued operations nonoperating pension expense income and items considered by management to be unusual net 

special items from net earnings loss attributable to shareholders reported under gaap adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results from continuing operations the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations 

the following are reconciliations of earnings loss attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings loss attributable to common shareholders on a total and per share basis additional detail is provided later in this form 10k regarding the net special items referenced in the charts below 









cash provided by operations including discontinued operations totaled 20 billion and 31 billion for 2021 and 2020 respectively the company generated free cash flow of approximately 15 billion in 2021 and 23 billion in 2020 respectively free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management utilizes this measure in connection with managing our business and believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available after reinvesting in the business to maintain a strong balance sheet pay dividends repurchase stock service debt and make 

investments for future growth it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the companys ongoing underlying operational performance we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods 

the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations   





the nongaap financial measures presented in this form 10k as referenced above have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with gaap in addition because not all companies utilize identical calculations the company’s presentation of nongaap measures in this form 10k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies including companies in the same industry as the company

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key operating cash costs such as raw material energy mill outage and distribution do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

use of cash during 2021 was primarily focused on working capital requirements capital spending debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the companys share repurchase program 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operations including discontinued operations totaled 20 billion in 2021 compared with 31 billion for 2020 cash used by working capital components accounts receivable contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 426 million in 2021 compared with cash provided by working capital components of 324 million in 2020 

cash dividends received from equity investments were 159 million in 2021 compared with 162 million in 2020

interest rate swaps 

our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt to manage this risk international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt during 2020 international paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of 85 million subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 see note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 76 through 79 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

variable interest entities 

information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 74 through 75 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands we received 48 billion of installment notes these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from thirdparty lenders these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and thirdparty loans were extended the restructured variable interest entities held installment notes of 48 billion and thirdparty loans of 42 billion which both matured in august 2021 we settled the thirdparty loans at their maturity with the proceeds from the installment notes this resulted in cash proceeds of approximately 630 million representing our equity in the variable interest entities maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure also resulted in a 72 million tax liability that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 as of december 31 2021 the companys remaining deferred tax liability associated with the 2015 financing entities was 813 million the nature and timing of the income tax due related to these transactions is currently under review by the internal revenue service 

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2022 

we expect another year of solid cash generation in 2022 furthermore we intend to continue to make choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive longterm 

value creation these include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our worldclass system and strengthen our packaging business 

our share repurchase program most recently approved by our board of directors on october 12 2021 which does not have an expiration date has approximately 29 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remaining authorized for purchase as of december 31 2021 we may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions including block trades privately negotiated transactions or otherwise subject to prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements restrictions in our debt documents applicable securities laws requirements and other factors in addition we pay regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors and is subject to restrictions in our debt documents 

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

capital spending for 2022 is planned at approximately 11 billion or about 96 of depreciation and amortization 

at december 31 2021 international paper’s credit agreements totaled 21 billion which is comprised of the 15 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement and up to 550 million under the receivables securitization program management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a predetermined margin dependent upon international paper’s credit rating at december 31 2021 the company had no borrowings outstanding under the 15 billion credit agreement or the 550 million receivables securitization program the company’s credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 75 and 76 in note 16  debt and lines of credit of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2021 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements 

international paper also has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity up to 10 billion supported by its 15 billion credit agreement under the terms of the program individual maturities on borrowings may vary but not exceed one year from the date of issue interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes the company had no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2021 under this program 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt meet working capital and dividend requirements and make common stock andor debt repurchases for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter with current cash balances and cash from operations supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense and we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase our common stock under our existing share repurchase program and debt including in open market purchases to the extent consistent with this capital structure planning the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors during 2020 management took various actions to further strengthen the company’s liquidity position in response to the covid19 pandemic this included the company deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under cares act the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27 2020 and december 31 2020 under the cares act 50 of the deferred payroll taxes was paid in 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31 2022 we believe that our credit agreements and commercial paper program provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in the current environment however an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2021 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa2 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2021 were as follows   



a includes financing lease obligations 

b includes 798 million relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company’s containerboard packaging and recycling business also includes 979 million relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of weyerhaeusers pulp business 

c not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 160 million also not included in the above table is 106 million of deemed repatriation transition tax associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which will be settled from 2022  2026 

we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2021 to be permanently reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon see note 13 income taxes on pages 68 through 70 of i tem 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2021 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 242 million lower than the fair value of plan assets excluding nonus plans approximately 595 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2019 2020 or 2021 at this time we 

do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2022 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim shareholders agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim joint venture international paper entered into a shareholders agreement with an initial 15year term expiring in october 2022 that automatically renews for successive fiveyear terms unless terminated by either party the shareholders agreement also includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholders agreement are commenced although it is not obligated to do so the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners 50 interests would be approximately 23 billion excluding the impact of ilim debt at december 31 2021 which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the companys option the purchase by the company of its partners’ 50 interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilims financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require a significant level of estimation or uncertainty by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived 

assets and goodwill pensions and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm 

while we have taken into account certain impacts arising from covid19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this annual report on form 10k the full impact of covid19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated however we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements may be affected 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including personal injury product liability environmental asbestos and other legal matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and if applicable other experts liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs liabilities for asbestosrelated matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data the company utilizes its inhouse legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal environmental and asbestos obligations supplemented as needed by thirdparty specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities 

we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors the workers compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate the ultimate settlement of workers compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

brazil goodwill tax matter  the brazilian federal revenue service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by sylvamo do brasil ltda a whollyowned subsidiary of the company until the october 1 2021 spinoff of the printing papers business the company received assessments for the tax years 

20072015 totaling approximately 106 million in tax and 351 million in interest penalties and fees as of december 31 2021 adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates after a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments we received other subsequent unfavorable decisions from the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals the company has appealed and intends to further appeal these and any future unfavorable administrative judgments to the brazilian federal courts however this tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve the company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transaction underlying these assessments and has concluded based on brazilian tax law that its tax position would be sustained 

the company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015 this assessment pertains to a business that was conveyed to sylvamo corporation as of october 1 2021 as part of our spinoff transaction pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement entered into between the company and sylvamo corporation the company will pay 60 and sylvamo will pay 40 on up to 300 million of any tax assessment related to the matter and the company will pay all amounts of the assessment over 300 million the brazilian government may enact a tax amnesty program that would allow sylvamo do brasil ltda to resolve this dispute for less than the assessed amount in addition all decisions concerning the conduct of the litigation related to this matter including strategy settlement pursuit and abandonment continue to be made by the company sylvamo corporation thus has no control over any decision related to this ongoing litigation as of october 1 2021 in connection with the recording of the distribution of assets and liabilities resulting from the spinoff transaction the company has established a liability representing the initial fair value of the contingent liability under the tax matter agreement the contingent liability was determined in accordance with asc 460 guarantees based on the probability weighting of various possible outcomes the initial fair value estimate and recorded liability as of december 31 2021 is 48 million this liability will not be adjusted in subsequent periods unless facts and circumstances change such that an amount greater than the initial recognized liability becomes probable and estimable 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from 

future operations or disposals a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test if a qualitative assessment is performed an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that based on that qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 

the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its north america industrial packaging reporting unit and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its emea industrial packaging reporting unit as of october 1 2021 

for the current year evaluation the company assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the north america industrial packaging reporting unit under the qualitative assessment and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value 

the company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit to its estimated fair value the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for emea industrial packaging due to the changes in the reporting units asset base as a result of acquisitions and divestitures since the previous quantitative goodwill impairment test the company calculated the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted approach based on 

discounted future cash flows market multiples and transaction multiples the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues operating profit margins and discount rates the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples the results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit 

in addition the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation in consideration of all relevant factors there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1 2021 

pension benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities 

in advance of the spinoff of the printing papers segment into a standalone publicly traded company sylvamo a legally separate sylvamo pension plan was established to transfer both pension liabilities and qualified pension assets for the approximately 900 active qualified pension participants who transitioned to sylvamo effective september 1 2021 the retirement plan of international paper and the sylvamo pension plan were legally separated and remeasured as of that date 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2021 for international paper’s pension plan were as follows   



the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2021 was 640 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2022 pension expense by approximately 27 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 19 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return 

earned on us pension plan assets was 140 and 113 for the past five and ten years respectively 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years 

net periodic pension plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2021 pension expense primarily reflects a higher asset returns lower interest cost due to a lower discount rate and lower actuarial loss due to a higher amortization period slightly offset by higher service cost 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31 2021 projected future net periodic pension plan expense income would be as follows   



the company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately 114 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2022 compared to income of 112 million in 2021 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2021 totaled approximately 121 billion consisting of 

approximately 18 equity securities 68 debt securities 8 real estate funds and 6 other assets the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there were no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2021 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 21 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in 2019 and 2020 the effects of inflation in the current year have been more significant than prior years as the pandemic has had an impact on economic conditions including labor market conditions economic activity consumer behavior supply shortages and disruptions and inflationary pressures sales prices and volumes are primarily influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations but are also currently being impacted by the current inflationary environment 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currency that has the most impact is the euro 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate 

purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 75 and 76 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 76 through 79 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2021 and 2020 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 67 billion and 93 billion respectively the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 304 million and 443 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices at december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value of these contracts was 

immaterial and the potential loss in fair value from a 10 adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts was also immaterial 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency interest rate swaps or foreign exchange 

contracts at december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was immaterial the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was also immaterial

environmental protection 

the company is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally in addition new environmental laws or regulations impacting our facilities around the world are routinely passed or proposed our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 46 million in 2020 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend 50 million in 2021 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures for 2022 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 45 million capital 

expenditures for 2023 environmental projects are estimated to be 30 million 

the company has completed capital projects to meet the us environmental protection agencys epa maximum achievable control technology mact and risk and technology review rtr regulations that require owners of specified pulp and paper process equipment and boilers to meet new air emissions standards for certain substances as portions of these mact and rtr regulations have been remanded to epa for further consideration it is not clear at this time 

what if any additional capital project expenditures might result from resolution of the open issues 

the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state 

tab le of contents 

laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many prps there are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company’s current closed or formerlyowned facilities and recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet for additional information regarding certain remediation actions see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data on pages 68 through 70 

see item 1a risk factors  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations 

climate change 

the company recognizes the impacts of climate change on people and our planet in order to manage climaterelated risks we are taking actions throughout our value chain to advance a lowcarbon economy 

we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day this cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests and at the end of use our lowcarbon products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material we work to advance the shift to a lowcarbon circular economy by designing products that are 100 reusable recyclable or compostable 

as part of our vision 2030 we have committed to incremental reductions in our scope i ii and iii greenhouse gas emissions 35 reduction by 2030 our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal is consistent with the paris climate agreement furthermore we use biomass and manufacturing residuals rather than fossil fuels to generate a majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills 

our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through 

carbon storage in forests 

in an effort to mitigate the impact of climate change various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been or may be undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted the company but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and continues international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs consistent with this objective participating countries aim to balance ghg emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or in effect achieve netzero global ghg emissions 

to assist member countries in meeting ghg reduction obligations the eu operates an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreements nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

us efforts including state regional and local measures 

the us congress has not passed ghg legislation the epa manages regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations and iv require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year 

several us states including states in which we operate facilities have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities california new york and virginia have already enacted such programs although these regulations have not and are not expected to have a material impact on the company we monitor proposed programs in other states as well however it is unclear what impacts if any future statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

tab le of contents 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change in the future it is unclear when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate the company’s costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on the company such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects the company has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

additional information regarding climate change and the company is available in our 2019 global citizenship report found on our website at wwwinternationalpapercom though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

 item 1a risk factors 

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its 

reputation operations and financial performance the board of directors exercises oversight of the company’s enterprise risk management program which includes strategic operational and financial matters as well as compliance and legal risks the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board’s standing committees and management and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs our business results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forwardlooking statements we make in any public disclosures 

overall risks 

the current covid19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business and may have material adverse effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly if negative economic conditions associated with covid19 persist or deteriorate the covid19 pandemic has resulted in authorities throughout the world implementing widespread measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines stayathome orders the promotion of social distancing and limitations on business activity including business closures these measures and the pandemic have caused a significant global economic downturn disrupting supply chains significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels and adversely impacting consumer confidence and spending the continued spread of covid19 has also led to significant disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets 

although governments of countries in which we operate have generally considered forest products and the supply chain on which we depend to be “essential industries” that should remain operational during this pandemic any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills plants or other 

tab le of contents 

facilities as a result of the covid19 pandemic including precautionary measures we take or are taken by governmental authorities that limits inperson workplace contact at any of our facilities to reduce the potential for employee exposure to covid19 could have an adverse effect on our business or operations if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic such as those described herein our operations will likely be negatively impacted 

covid19 has had a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products in addition our operations in industrial packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impact of covid19 

in addition to the reduction in demand for our products that the covid19 pandemic has had or could have other negative impacts on our business include but are not limited to the following 

• we rely on a global workforce and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees customers and others with whom we do business while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations during the pandemic we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance our business operations may be additionally disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions or measures responsive to the pandemic measures taken across our business operations to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employee base customers and others 

• a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic our business operations may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects to our business if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure 

• cost management and various costcontainment actions implemented across our business in response to the covid19 pandemic could hinder execution of our business strategy including deferral of planned capital expenditures and could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

while we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business the extent of the impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial performance as well as our ability to execute nearterm and longterm business strategies and initiatives will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control and some of which we are not currently aware including but not limited to a the duration severity and scope of the pandemic including additional waves increases and spikes in the number of covid19 cases in certain areas b rapidlychanging governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak including the duration degree and effectiveness of directives as well as the easing removal and potential reinstitution of directives c the availability and widespread administration of treatments and vaccines for covid19 d the extent and duration of the pandemic’s adverse effect on economic and social activity consumer confidence discretionary spending and preferences labor and healthcare costs and unemployment rates any of which may reduce demand for our products e any temporary reduction in our workforce closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations and f the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations which could result in terminations of contracts losses of revenue adverse effects to our supply chain if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs 

given the inherent uncertainty surrounding covid19 we expect the pandemic will continue to have an adverse impact on portions of our business in the near term if these conditions persist for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition

we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and global regional and local weather conditions 

our operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations which impact the productivity of forests the frequency and severity of wildfires the distribution and abundance of species and the spread of disease or insect epidemics additionally the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes hailstorms wildfires snow ice storms the spread of disease and insect infestations could also affect timber supply or cause variations in the cost of raw materials changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe and could adversely affect timber harvesting the effects of climate change and global regional and local weather conditions could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally biomass natural gas electricity and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries individual governments legislation and regulations as well as changes in the global economy in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for thirdparty transportation our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and 

general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes moreover consumer preferences are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences or rulings nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor

of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries likewise disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries eg the us and china which can result in tariffs could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad and the us department of treasury’s office of foreign asset control and other nonus government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries persons and entities failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business as of december 31 2020 international paper had approximately 81 billion of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

• it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital capital expenditures product development dividends share repurchases debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

• a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

• the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations 

• it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and 

• it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth 

in addition we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives moreover the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted additionally despite these restrictions we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above 

moreover certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offering rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in november 2020 the administrator of libor announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month libor offered rates will cease after december 31 2021 but the publication of the remaining libor offered rates will continue until june 20 2023 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets additionally uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our 

tab le of contents 

financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 10 billion of our debt as of december 31 2020 the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes including those delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 488 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 15 variable interest entities  

on pages 70 through 72 and note 13 income taxes  on pages 65 through 68 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 or later for certain acquired populations as described in note 19 retirement plans  on pages 78 through 84 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and substantially all hourly union and nonunion employees regardless of hire date the company has frozen participation under these plans for us salaried employees including credited service and compensation on or after january 1 2019 however the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31 2018 we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes health care utilization by participants and potential legislative impacts and government oversight 

our pension plans are currently underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2020 was 11 billion the amount and timing of future contributions which could be material will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates

negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

• fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other catastrophes 

• the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply 

• the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities 

• disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs 

• terrorism or threats of terrorism 

• information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes including cyberattacks 

• domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners including joint venture partners around the world 

• unscheduled maintenance outages 

• prolonged power failures 

• an equipment failure 

• a chemical spill or release 

• explosion of a boiler or other equipment 

• damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities 

• disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads bridges railroad tracks and tunnels 

• a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease such as the outbreak of the covid19 virus or any other public health crisis 

• failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms 

• labor difficulties and 

• other operational problems 

any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

the announced proposed spinoff of our printing papers business may not be completed within the expected timeframe or at all and we may not achieve the expected benefits from the separation on december 3 2020 we announced a plan to pursue a spinoff of our printing papers segment into spinco a standalone publicly traded company international paper will distribute shares of spinco to international paper shareholders on a pro rata basis in a manner intended to be taxfree to international paper and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes the transaction is expected to be completed in late third quarter 2021 the proposed spinoff is subject to customary conditions including final approval by the international paper board of directors receipt of a tax opinion and the filing and effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission no assurance can be given regarding the form that a spinoff transaction may take or the specific terms or timing thereof or that a spinoff will in fact occur in addition international paper expects to retain up to 199 of the shares of

spinco at the time of the separation with the intent to monetize in the future and provide additional proceeds to international paper no assurance can be given that we will be able to monetize the shares of spinco at a favorable price or at all or the timing thereof 

international paper and spinco may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits including cost savings from the separation on the expected timeframe or at all as independent publiclytraded companies international paper and spinco will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions such as changes in the industrial packaging or printing papers industry which could result in increased volatility in their respective cash flows working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business financial condition and results of operations in connection with the transaction spinco is expected to pay international paper a dividend to be used to pay down outstanding international paper indebtedness there can be no assurance that spinco will be able to pay a dividend the amount of any such dividend or that any dividend paid will be sufficient to repay the amount of indebtedness expected further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of international paper’s common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

moreover substantial expenses will be incurred in connection with the transaction such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the transaction may be offset by costs or delays incurred in effectuating the transaction executing the proposed transaction will require significant time and attention from international paper’s senior management and employees which could disrupt international paper’s ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not 

achieve the expected benefits this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper 

corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above the focus of our management’s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations the demands on our financial operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions 

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyberattacks such as ransomware and data theft by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or social activist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company

employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax trade and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs 

for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations our environmental expenditures include among other areas those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party moreover we may be directly impacted by and are working to manage the risks and costs to us our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and the availability of energy and water resources these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands which are a key resource in the production of our products increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase we also face risks arising from the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste deforestation and land use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and 

requirements will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

our global operations subject us to complex and evolving us and international privacy laws and regulations such as general data protection regulation “gdpr” brazils lei geral de pnoteçāo de dados lgpd and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” and the california privacy rights act cpra these laws require the company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data these are significant penalties for noncompliance including monetary fines disruption of operations and reputational harm moreover governmental authorities around the world are considering or are in the process of implementing new data protection regulations 

many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims changes to our business practices data processing and security systems penalties increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses the recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation ip proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and where necessary modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws nevertheless relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws which could subject us to penalties andor litigation in addition there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security and the policies procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the gdpr the ccpa andor of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation cause loss of consumer

confidence subject us to government enforcement actions including fines or result in private litigation against us which could result in loss of revenue increased costs liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results 

as a final example the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities additionally administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently we are currently subject to tax audits in the us brazil poland russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world in some cases we have appealed and may continue to appeal assessments by taxing authorities in the court system as such tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results we are a party to various legal regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters including with respect to environmental matters in addition we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate to past present and future facts events circumstances and occurrences should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results 

if the spinoff were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then international paper spinco and our shareholders may be subject to significant us federal income taxes international paper intends to receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify as taxfree to spinco international paper and its shareholders for us federal income tax purposes a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position in addition international paper’s tax counsel will rely on certain representations and covenants delivered by international paper and spinco in rendering such opinion international paper may also pursue a private letter ruling from the irs to 

the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify as taxfree to international paper spinco and international paper shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

if the irs ultimately determines that the spinoff is taxable then the spinoff could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the international paper shareholders for us federal income tax purposes international paper could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and spinco may be required to indemnify international paper for such tax liability pursuant to a tax matters agreement there can be no assurance that spinco would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify international paper for any such tax liability 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under internal revenue code the code section 355 of the code the spinoff may be taxable to international paper but not international paper’s shareholders pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or more by vote or value change in ownership of either international paper or spinco directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff for this purpose any acquisitions of international paper’s or spinco’s common stock within two years before or after the spinoff are presumed to be part of such a plan although international paper or spinco may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a “safe harbor” described in the us income tax regulations

executive summary 

fullyear 2020 net earnings attributable to shareholders were 482 million 122 per diluted share compared with 12 billion 307 per diluted share for fullyear 2019 

international paper navigated the impacts of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 to deliver solid earnings and outstanding cash generation our 2020 performance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our employees our diverse customer base and our world class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities we ran our manufacturing system well and leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting systems to overcome significant challenges due to the pandemic while managing costs extremely well across our three businesses with no material operational disruptions due to the pandemic we continued to grow value for our shareholders with a return above our cost of capital which marks the eleventh consecutive year with valuecreating returns we generated fullyear cash from operations of 31 billion and free cash flow of 23 billion given the significant economic uncertainty we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash generation and enhance our financial strength we continued to execute on our capital allocation framework in 2020 we returned 820 

million to shareowners and reduced debt by 17 billion we also invested in our north american and emea corrugated packaging businesses to enhance our capabilities and grow earnings finally in the fourth quarter we announced plans to spinoff our printing papers business into a standalone publicly traded company which we expect to complete in the third quarter 2021 

compared to 2019 the company’s 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with the pandemic price and mix were negatively affected by the fullyear impact of 2019 price index movements in our north america packaging business as well as lower average pricing in our global cellulose fibers and printing papers businesses volume was also an earnings headwind due to the unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers related to the pandemic these price and volume headwinds were partly offset by strong volume growth in our north american packaging business outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage expenses during 2020 we made choices around planned maintenance and other spending priorities in response to market disruptions resulting from the pandemic operating costs were higher in 2020 primarily due to higher costs in the latter part of the year as we flexed our system to meet strong packaging demand overall input costs were favorable in 2020 driven by lower wood energy and distribution costs although we did see an increase in recovered fiber energy and distribution in the fourth quarter equity earnings were lower in 2020 due to decreased ilim earnings driven by the challenging global pulp markets along with a foreign exchange loss on ilim’s us dollar denominated net debt 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 in our industrial packaging business we expect price and mix to improve on the realization of prior price index movement volume is expected to be flat sequentially with continued strong box demand in north america operations and costs are expected to improve sequentially resulting from the nonrepeat of isolated reliability issues and other unfavorable onetime items in the fourth quarter 2020 maintenance outage expense is expected to be higher along with increased input costs mainly due to higher recovered fiber and distribution costs in our global cellulose fibers business we expect improved price and mix on the realization of prior price index movements volume is expected to be stable and operations and costs are expected to improve on the nonrepeat of unfavorable fourth quarter items maintenance outage expenses are expected to decrease moderately and input costs are expected to increase on seasonally

higher wood and energy costs in our printing papers business price and mix is expected to be stable and volume is expected to decrease mostly due to lower seasonal demand in brazil and russia operations and costs are expected to improve and maintenance outage expense is expected to be flat input costs are expected to be higher primarily due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs lastly for our ilim joint venture we expect lower earnings on the nonrepeat of the foreign currency gain on us denominated debt recognized in the fourth quarter 2020 

as we enter 2021 we are mindful that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic and there is still uncertainty accordingly we remain committed to our covid19 principles to focus on what we need to do as a company to remain strong and resilient for all our stakeholders – to keep our employees and contractors safe to take care of our customers and to maintain our financial strength looking to 2021 we anticipate continued strong demand for corrugated packaging and pulp and are poised to grow earnings we remain focused on cash generation and will continue to make choices consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive longterm value creation

we have seen a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products demand for our pulp containerboard and corrugated box products has not been negatively impacted by covid19 to date but our operations in industrial packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impacts of covid19 the recent resurgence of the virus in many areas has led to additional governmental measures such as stayathome orders or business and school closures negatively impacting our supply chain and therefore our production 

there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic including 

with respect to the various economic reopening plans 

and the resurgence of the virus in many areas additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and private businesses to attempt to contain the covid19 outbreak or to mitigate its impact the extent and duration of social distancing and stayathome orders the efficacy of various vaccines and availability and the ongoing impact of covid19 on unemployment economic activity and consumer confidence developments related to covid19 are significantly adversely affecting portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly if negative global economic conditions persist for a significant period of time or deteriorate

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key operating cash costs such as raw material energy mill outage and distribution do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

capital spending for 2021 is planned at approximately 800 million or about 61 of depreciation and amortization 

at december 31 2020 international paper’s credit agreements totaled 28 billion which is comprised of the 750 million contractually committed revolving credit agreement the 15 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement and up to 550 million under the receivables securitization program management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a predetermined margin dependent upon international paper’s credit rating at december 31 2020 the company had no borrowings outstanding under the 750 million revolving credit agreement the 15 billion credit agreement or the 550 million receivables securitization program the company’s credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 72 and 73 in note 16  debt and lines of credit of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2020 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements after considering the company’s liquidity position in relation to covid19 and the current economic environment the companys receivable securitization program was amended from a committed financing arrangement to an uncommitted financing arrangement in february 2021 with the borrowing limit and expiration date remaining unchanged” 

in addition to the 28 billion in credit agreements international paper has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity of 10 billion under the terms of the program individual maturities on borrowings may vary but not exceed one year from the date of issue interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes the company had no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 30 million of borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2019 under this program 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements for the next 12 months with current cash balances and cash from operations supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors during 2020 management took various actions to further strengthen the company’s liquidity position in response to the covid19 pandemic this included the company amending its receivable securitization program from an uncommitted financing arrangement to a committed financing arrangement in april 2020 and also deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under cares act the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27 2020 and december 31 2020 under the cares act 50 of the deferred payroll taxes will be paid by december 31 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31 2022 we believe that our credit agreements commercial paper program and the actions taken in response to covid19 provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in this uncertain environment however an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2020 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa2 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2020 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 10 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets excluding nonus plans approximately 595 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2018 2019 or 2020 at this time we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2021 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and 

amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim shareholders agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholders agreement are commenced although it is not obligated to do so the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners 50 interests would be approximately 700 million which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the companys option the purchase by the company of its partners’ 50 interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilims financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder’s agreement 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of 

tab le of contents 

the company’s board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm 

while we have taken into account certain impacts arising from covid19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this annual report on form 10k the full impact of covid19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated however we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements may be affected 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including personal injury product liability environmental asbestos and other legal matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and if applicable other experts liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs liabilities for asbestosrelated matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data the company utilizes its inhouse legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal environmental and asbestos obligations supplemented as needed by thirdparty specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities 

we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors the workers compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate the ultimate settlement of workers compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 

value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test if a qualitative assessment is performed an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that based on that qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 

the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its north america industrial packaging emea industrial packaging european papers russian papers and brazilian papers reporting units as of october 1 2020 the company elected to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units due to the current economic environment the quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed by comparing the carrying amount of each respective reporting unit to its estimated fair value the company calculated the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with goodwill using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows market multiples and transaction multiples the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues operating profit margins and discount rates the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples the results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units for our emea packaging reporting unit the fair value exceeded the carrying amount by 13 while the reporting unit’s forecasted results support the fair value significant changes in or inability to achieve the forecasts could result in the impairment of all or a portion of the reporting unit’s 70 million goodwill balance as of december 31 2020 while the printing papers

segment has experienced a significant decline in demand for its products in the current year as a result of covid19 the company has determined the fair values for those reporting units have not been materially impacted based on managements cumulative longterm outlook and forecasts which are inherently subjective given the uncertainty around the duration and magnitude of the economic impact of covid19 currently all of our printing papers reporting units fair values exceed carrying values by more than 85 

in addition the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation in consideration of all relevant factors there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1 2020 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of the global cellulose fibers reporting unit and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit totaling 52 million was impaired this impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 the decline in the fair value of global cellulose fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the global cellulose fibers reporting units operations 

pension benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2020 for international paper’s pension plan were as follows   



the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2020 was 700 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2021 pension expense by approximately 28 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 27 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 139 and 107 for the past five and ten years respectively 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense 

tab le of contents 

prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years 

net periodic pension plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2020 pension expense primarily reflects a higher return on assets and lower interest costs slightly offset by higher service cost 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31 2020 projected future net periodic pension plan expense income would be as follows   



the company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately 114 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2021 compared to expense of 32 million in 2020 the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2021 is primarily due to higher return on assets lower interest cost and lower amortization of actuarial losses partially offset by higher service cost 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2020 totaled approximately 120 billion consisting of approximately 40 equity securities 48 debt securities 7 real estate funds and 5 other assets the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there were no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2020 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which 

totaled 31 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 72 and 73 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 73 through 77 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2020 and 2019 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 93 billion and 98 billion respectively the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 443 million and 511 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices at both december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of these contracts was immaterial and the potential loss in fair value from a 10 adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts was also immaterial 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 3 million liability and a 16 million asset respectively the

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally in addition new environmental laws or regulations impacting our facilities around the world are routinely passed or proposed our continuing objectives include 

1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 70 million in 2019 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend 80 million in 2020 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures for 2021 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 85 million capital expenditures for 2022 environmental projects are estimated to be 65 million 

the company has completed capital projects to meet the us environmental protection agencys epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology regulations that require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances although certain aspects of litigation challenging all or portions of the boiler mact regulations remain open we have not identified any additional boiler mact capital project expenditures that might result from resolution of the open issues 

the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many prps there are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company’s current closed or formerlyowned facilities and recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet for additional information regarding certain remediation actions see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data on pages 65 through 68  

climate change 

international paper plays a significant role in responding to the climate change challenge our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day this cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests and at the end of use our products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material we endeavor to continue to lead the international business community in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore 

 

forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests furthermore we use biomass and manufacturing residuals rather than fossil fuels to generate a substantial majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills 

in an effort to mitigate the impact of climate change various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been or may be undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs consistent with this objective participating countries aim to balance ghg emissions generation and sequestration in the second half of this century or in effect achieve netzero global ghg emissions 

as part of the paris agreement many countries established nonbinding emissions reduction targets for instance the us made a nonbinding commitment to hold ghg emissions 7 below 2005 ghg emissions levels by 2020 and 26 to 28 below by 2025 other countries in which we operate made similar nonbinding commitments on august 4 2017 the us filed official notice to withdraw from the paris agreement notwithstanding the notice of withdrawal by the us the company’s voluntary ghg reductions which are set out in our annual global citizenship report remain roughly in line with the percentages of the us prior target reductions it is not clear at this time what if any further reductions by the company might be required by the countries in which we operate due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of these agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting ghg reduction obligations the eu operates an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreements nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

us efforts including state regional and local measures 

the us congress has not passed ghg legislation the epa manages regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii control emissions from new oil and gas processing operations and iv require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year 

several us states including states in which we operate facilities have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities california new york and virginia have already enacted such programs although these regulations have not and are not expected to have a material impact on the company we are monitoring proposed programs in other states however it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change in the future it is unclear when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper is available in our 2018 global citizenship report found on our website at wwwinternationalpapercom though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

 item 1a risk factors 

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance the board of directors exercises oversight of the company’s enterprise risk management program which includes strategic operational and financial matters as well as compliance and legal risks the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board’s standing committees and management and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs our business results of operations andor financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forwardlooking statements we make in any public disclosures 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally biomass natural gas electricity and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood 

fiber varies based upon availability and source the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries individual governments legislation and regulations as well as changes in the global economy in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for thirdparty transportation our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes moreover consumer preferences are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar 

 

employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences or rulings nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements could negatively affect our financial results in addition outbreak of a widespread health epidemic such as a coronavirus influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses could also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects including if operations of our customers are adversely impacted in this regard while we do not currently expect that our financial results will be significantly and adversely affected by the covid19 virus that was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the covid19 virus including with respect to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by chinese or other governmental authorities to contain the covid19 virus or to treat its impact and the extent to which the covid19 outbreak may impact our financial results including as the result of its possible impact on the chinese or global economy is not certain 

trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries likewise disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries eg the us and china which can result in tariffs could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for 

example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad and the us department of treasury’s office of foreign asset control and other nonus government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries persons and entities failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business as of december 31 2019  international paper had approximately 98 billion of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 in addition we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives moreover the restrictions associated with 

 

these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted additionally despite these restrictions we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above 

moreover certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offering rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets additionally uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 14 billion of our debt as of december 31 2019  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade 

suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes including those delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 485 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 15 variable interest entities  on pages 68 through 70  and note 13 income taxes  on pages 62 through 65  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 or later for certain acquired populations as described in note 19 retirement plans  on pages 75 through 81  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and substantially all hourly union and nonunion employees regardless of hire date the company has frozen participation under these plans for us salaried employees including credited services and compensation on or after january 1 2019 however the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31 2018 we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes 

 

in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes health care utilization by participants and potential legislative impacts and government oversight 

our pension plans are currently underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2019 was 16 billion  the amount and timing of future contributions which could be material will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 



 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper 

corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above the focus of our management’s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations the demands on our financial operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions 

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyber attacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or social activist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events network system application and data breaches 

could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax trade and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs 

for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations our environmental expenditures include among other areas those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party moreover we may be directly impacted by and are working to manage the risks and costs to us our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change greenhouse gases and the availability of energy and water resources these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands which are a key resource in the production of our products increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase we also face risks arising from the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations on these and other environmental sustainability matters such as packaging and waste deforestation and land 

 

use these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them these risks could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

additionally we are subject to complex and evolving us and international privacy laws and regulations including those pertaining to the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 with respect to all member states of the european union includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of eu residents that are partially different from those that had previously been in place and includes significant penalties for noncompliance the ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 affords california residents and households expanded privacy protections moreover governmental authorities around the world are considering or are in the process of implementing new data protection regulations 

many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims changes to our business practices data processing and security systems penalties increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses the recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation ip proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and where necessary modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws nevertheless relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws which could subject us to penalties andor litigation in addition there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data the training of employees and vendors 

on data privacy and data security and the policies procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the gdpr the ccpa andor of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation cause loss of consumer confidence subject us to government enforcement actions including fines or result in private litigation against us which could result in loss of revenue increased costs liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results 

as a final example the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities additionally administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently we are currently subject to tax audits in the us brazil poland russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world in some cases we have appealed and may continue to appeal assessments by taxing authorities in the court system as such tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results we are a party to various legal regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters including with respect to environmental matters in addition we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate to past present and future facts events circumstances and occurrences should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results

executive summary 

fullyear 2019 net earnings were 12 billion  307 per diluted share compared with net earnings of 20 billion  485 per diluted share for fullyear 2018 

international paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding cash generation in 2019 our performance demonstrates our ability to generate strong cash flow and the flexibility of the company to navigate well through a challenging global environment while the us economy remains healthy during 2019 we managed through significant inventory headwinds and broader trade tensions that impacted our exports against this backdrop we focused on optimizing our full value chain by strengthening commercial offerings in faster growing packaging segments running our manufacturing system well and leveraging the flexibility of our mill and converting system we continued to grow value for our shareholders with returns above our cost of capital for a tenth consecutive year our capital allocation choices were consistent with our framework in 2019 we returned 13 billion to shareholders through dividends of about 800 million and share repurchases of about 500 million the company also increased its dividend for the tenth consecutive year reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable dividend we also repaid approximately 1 billion of debt during 2019 as part of our commitment to a strong balance sheet and to maintain an investment 

 

grade rating we continued to invest strategically to strengthen our industrial packaging business in our north american corrugated packaging business we made targeted investments to enhance our capabilities and reinforce our strong position in the fastest growing segments in our emea packaging business we completed selective acquisitions to expand our converting network around the madrid spain mill lastly in january 2020 we monetized approximately 19 of our investment in graphic packaging in exchange for 250 million 

compared to 2018 the company’s 2019 results reflect the impact of a challenging global environment which resulted in price and mix being a headwind mostly due to significant price pressure in export pulp and containerboard markets as well as the price impact of index movements in our north american industrial packaging business volume negatively impacted 2019 results due to challenging export markets in particular export containerboard volume was impacted by unusually high customer inventories at the start of 2019 which took most of the year to normalize operations and costs were impacted by significant economic downtime particularly in the first half of 2019 due to lower export shipments and our ability to reduce inventories across our north american industrial packaging system due to improved supply chain operations input costs were favorable for the full year primarily from lower recovered fiber and energy costs even though wood costs moderated in the second half of 2019 they had a negative impact on earnings in 2019 equity earnings decreased in 2019 due to lower ilim earnings driven by the challenging global pulp market dynamics 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 in our industrial packaging business we expect lower price and mix on the flowthrough of prior price index movements volume is expected to be seasonally lower in north america operations and costs are expected to be negatively impacted by the nonrepeat of a favorable inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter as well as higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with the riverdale mill conversion maintenance outage expense is expected to be higher and input costs are expected to be higher seasonally in our global cellulose fibers business we expect lower price and mix on the impact of prior price index movements volume is expected to improve driven by higher fluff pulp shipments operations and costs are expected to negatively impact earnings due to the nonrepeat of favorable items recognized in the fourth quarter maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase while input costs are expected to remain stable in our printing papers business flowthrough of prior negative price movement is expected to be offset by improved geographic mix volume is expected to be down mostly due to seasonally lower volumes in brazil operations and costs are 

expected to have a favorable impact on earnings mostly due to the nonrepeat of an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter as well as improved fixed cost absorption in north america maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase while input costs should remain stable lastly we expect lower equity earnings from our ilim joint venture on the nonrepeat of the fourth quarter foreign exchange gain 

  

looking ahead to the fullyear 2020 we expect to generate solid cash flows despite earnings headwinds by continuing to leverage the flexibility of the company to manage costs capital spending and working capital earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by price carryover from 2019 as well as the impact of the january 2020 containerboard index movement earnings are also expected to be negatively impacted by higher planned maintenance outage expense and costs related to the riverdale conversion including unabsorbed fixed costs during the conversion process we plan to offset anticipated inflation through deliberate improvement initiatives the fundamentals of our packaging and fluff pulp businesses are solid  we believe we are well positioned to capture growth while continuing to optimize the company’s value chain to position us with positive momentum as we navigate through 2020 lastly we intend to continue to make choices for the use of the company’s strong cash generation that are consistent with our capital allocation framework in order to drive longterm value creation 

adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are nongaap measures and are defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense net earnings loss and diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of nonoperating pension expense items considered by management to be unusual special items and discontinued operations from the earnings reported under gaap adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations

cash provided by operations totaled 36 billion and 32 billion for 2019 and 2018  respectively the company generated free cash flow of approximately 23 billion and 17 billion in 2019 and 2018  respectively free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available after reinvesting in the business to maintain a strong balance sheet pay dividends repurchase stock service debt and make investments for future growth it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the companys ongoing underlying operational performance we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods 

the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations

industrial packaging net sales for 2019 decreased 4 to 153 billion compared with 159 billion in 2018  operating profits in 2019 were 9 lower than in 2018  comparing 2019 with 2018 benefits from lower input costs 124 million and lower maintenance outage costs 22 million were more than offset by lower average sales price and an unfavorable mix 61 million lower sales volumes 107 million and higher operating costs 179 million 



a includes intrasegment sales of 118 million for 2019 and 233 million for 2018 

north american industrial packagings sales volumes decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 for export containerboard primarily due to customer destocking as customers exited 2018 with high inventory levels which persisted through the first half of 2019 box shipments were also lower reflecting weaker demand and the impact of customer gains and losses in 2019 the business took about 14 million tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with 05 million tons of total downtime in 2018 average sales prices were significantly lower primarily due to lower export containerboard prices which were partially offset by higher sales prices for boxes input costs were substantially lower primarily for recycled fiber planned maintenance downtime costs were 23 million lower in 2019 than in 2018 operating costs increased due to inflation but were mostly offset by strong mill manufacturing operations earnings benefited from a favorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2019 compared with an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2018 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes for boxes are expected to be seasonally lower shipments of containerboard to export markets are also expected to be lower average sales margins for boxes are expected to be lower reflecting the recent price index movements input costs primarily for wood and energy are expected to be relatively flat planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about 90 million higher as we move into a high maintenance outage quarter operating costs are anticipated to be higher reflecting the impact of unabsorbed fixed costs related to the riverdale conversion 



emea industrial packagings sales volumes in 2019 were lower than in 2018 reflecting weaker economic conditions in turkey and a slower fruit and vegetable season in morocco average sales margins improved significantly in all regions driven by lower containerboard costs and stable sales prices for boxes other input costs were flat planned maintenance downtime costs were also flat operating costs were lower due to the rampup of the madrid spain mill and the benefits of our optimization initiatives partially offset by inflation in turkey earnings also benefited from the box plant acquisitions completed in the first half of 2019 earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily in turkey 

entering the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes are expected to be seasonally higher average sales margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting lower containerboard costs planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about 3 million higher input costs should be stable operating costs are expected to be higher driven by inflation

european coated paperboards sales volumes in 2019 compared with 2018 increased in both europe and russia average sales margins were higher reflecting higher average sales prices net of an unfavorable mix in europe and higher average sales prices and a favorable mix in russia input costs were stable as lower purchased pulp and energy costs in europe were offset by higher energy costs in russia and higher wood and chemicals costs in europe planned maintenance downtime costs were flat operating costs were higher earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts in both europe and russia 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes are expected to be stable as higher volumes in europe are offset by lower volumes in russia average sales margins are expected to be higher in both regions input costs are expected to be flat in europe and higher in russia primarily for wood and chemicals maintenance outage costs are expected to be flat due to no outages in the fourth quarter and no planned outages in the first quarter operating costs are expected to be lower 

global cellulose fibers 

demand for cellulose fibers products is closely correlated with changes in demand for absorbent hygiene products primarily driven by the demographics and income growth in various geographic regions it is further affected by changes in currency rates that can benefit or hurt producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs mill outage costs and freight costs 



global cellulose fibers net sales for 2019 decreased 10 to 26 billion  compared with 28 billion in 2018  operating profits in 2019 were significantly lower than in 2018  comparing 2019 with 2018 benefits from higher sales volumes 3 million lower input costs 8 million and lower maintenance outage costs 16 million were 

more than offset by lower average sales price and mix 216 million and higher operating costs 79 million 

sales volumes in 2019 compared with 2018 were lower as higher market pulp volumes were more than offset by lower fluff pulp volumes in 2019 the business took about 300000 tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with about 180000 tons of total downtime in 2018 average sales margins were significantly lower reflecting lower average pulp prices driven by very challenging supply and demand conditions outside the us average sales margins were also negatively affected by an unfavorable product mix reflecting a decrease in sales of fluff pulp input costs were flat planned maintenance downtime costs were 16 million lower in 2019 operating costs increased primarily due to inflation and an unfavorable mill manufacturing mix in europe and russia sales volumes increased average sales prices decreased significantly in both regions input costs were higher for wood chemicals and purchased pulp in europe and chemicals and energy in russia planned maintenance downtime costs were flat 

entering the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher primarily for fluff pulp average sales margins are expected to be lower reflecting the impact of prior price index movement input costs are expected to be stable planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be 27 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019 operating costs are expected to increase due to seasonality and higher distribution costs in europe sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher and stable in russia average sales margins are expected to be be higher in both regions planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about 7 million lower in the first quarter of 2020 in europe and rusia 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs mill outage costs and freight costs 



printing papers net sales for 2019 of 43 billion decreased 2  compared with 44 billion in 2018  operating profits in 2019 were 3 lower than in 2018  comparing 2019 with 2018 benefits from higher average 

 

sales price realizations net of mix 116 million were more than offset by lower sales volumes 14 million higher operating costs 54 million higher input costs 54 million and higher planned maintenance downtime costs 8 million 



north american printing papers sales volumes for 2019 were lower than in 2018 primarily for commercial printing paper in 2019 the business took about 125000 tons of total maintenance and economic downtime compared with about 48000 tons of total downtime in 2018 average sales margins improved due to the realization of sales price increases for both cutsize paper and rolls net of an unfavorable geographic mix input costs were higher primarily for wood planned maintenance downtime costs were 4 million higher in 2019 operating costs were higher primarily due to inflation and an unfavorable manufacturing mix mostly offset by lower distribution costs and favorable mill operations earnings were negatively impacted by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in 2019 

entering the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes are expected to be lower primarily for export markets average sales margins are expected to be stable input costs are expected to be stable operating costs are expected to be higher due to seasonality and inflation earnings are expected to benefit from the nonrepeat of an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019 planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to increase by about 29 million in the first quarter of 2020 



a includes intrasegment sales of 42 million for 2019 and 13 million for 2018 

brazilian papers sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in 2019 were higher compared with 2018 for export markets but lower for domestic markets average sales margins were lower as higher average domestic sales prices were more than offset by lower average export sales prices and an unfavorable geographic mix input costs increased primarily for virgin fiber chemicals and energy manufacturing costs were lower but were offset by higher other operating costs planned maintenance downtime costs were 1 million lower in 2019 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 sales volumes for uncoated 

freesheet paper are expected to be seasonally lower average sales margins are expected to decrease primarily due to an unfavorable geographic mix input costs are expected to be stable planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be about 3 million lower in the first quarter of 2020 operating costs are expected to be lower 



european papers sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in 2019 were higher in europe and russia compared with 2018 average sales margins increased for uncoated freesheet paper in both regions reflecting the realization of price increases implemented throughout 2018 and 2019 input costs were higher for wood and chemicals in europe and chemicals and energy in russia planned maintenance downtime costs were 3 million higher in 2019 than in 2018 operating costs were higher earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts in both regions 

entering 2020 sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in the first quarter are expected to increase in europe but expected to decrease in russia compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 average sales margins are expected to be lower in europe and stable in russia input costs should be higher in both regions mainly for chemicals in europe and wood and chemicals in russia maintenance outage costs should be about 9 million lower due to no planned outages in the first quarter operating costs are expected to be lower 



on may 29 2019 international paper announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its controlling interest in its indian papers business the transaction closed on october 30 2019 see note 8 divestitures and impairments on pages 56 through 58 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion 

equity earnings net of taxes  ilim 

international paper accounts for its investment in ilim  a separate reportable industry segment using the equity method of accounting 

the company recorded equity earnings net of taxes related to ilim of 207 million in 2019  compared with earnings of 290 million in 2018  operating results recorded in 2019 included an aftertax noncash foreign exchange gain of 32 million  compared with an aftertax 

 

foreign exchange loss of 82 million in 2018  primarily on the remeasurement of ilims us dollar denominated net debt 

coming off of a strong market in 2018 sales volumes for the joint venture decreased by 3 in 2019  primarily for containerboard shipments to china russia and other export markets shipments of softwood pulp and hardwood pulp to china were slightly higher but fell below prior year levels in russia and other export markets average sales price realizations were significantly lower for sales of softwood pulp hardwood pulp and containerboard in all markets input costs were higher primarily for wood chemicals and fuel distribution costs were negatively impacted by transportation tariffs and inflation ilim completed two major capital projects in 2019 the rebuild of the kraft linerboard line at its bratsk mill and the modernization of a pulp line at the ust ilmsk mill the company received cash dividends from the joint venture of 246 million in 2019 and 128 million in 2018  

entering the first quarter of 2020 sales volumes are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the seasonal slowdown in china based on pricing to date in the current quarter average sales prices are expected to decrease for softwood pulp hardwood pulp and containerboard input costs and distribution costs are projected to be relatively flat 

equity earnings  gpip 

international paper recorded equity earnings of 46 million in 2019 and 46 million in 2018 on its ownership position in gpip the company received cash dividends from the investment of 27 million in 2019 and 25 million in 2018  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key operating cash costs such as raw material energy mill outage and distribution do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

use of cash during 2019 was primarily focused on capital spending debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the companys share repurchase program 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operations including discontinued operations totaled 36 billion in 2019  compared with 32 billion for 2018  cash provided by working capital components accounts receivable contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 342 million in 2019  compared with cash used by working capital components of 439 million in 2018  cash dividends received from equity investments were 273 million in 2019  compared with 153 million in 2018  

investment activities 

including discontinued operations the cash outflow from investment activities in 2019 decreased from 2018  as 2018 included higher capital spending the company maintains an average capital spending target around depreciation and amortization levels or modestly above due to strategic plans over the course of an economic cycle capital spending was 13 billion in 2019  or 98 of depreciation and amortization compared with 16 billion in 2018  or 118 of depreciation and amortization across our segments capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from 616 to 1161 in 2019  

the following table shows capital spending by business segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018    



capital spending in 2020 is expected to be approximately 10 billion  or 74 of depreciation and amortization including approximately 250 million of strategic investments the expected reduction in capital spending in 2020 is primarily due to the completion of large strategic investments in our containerboard mill system including the madrid spain mill and the riverdale mill conversions which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020 

acquisitions 

see note 7 acquisitions on page 56 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of the companys acquisitions 

 

financing activities 

amounts related to early debt extinguishment during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



 

2019 financing activities during 2019 included debt issuances of 534 million and reductions of 15 billion for a net decrease of 973 million  

in june 2019 international paper issued 200 million of 355 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date in 2029 the proceeds from this offering together with a combination of available cash and other borrowings were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and other existing indebtedness 

in october 2019 international paper issued 127 million of environmental development bonds with interest rates ranging from 190 to 210 and maturity dates in 2024 the proceeds from this offering were used to repay other existing environmental development bonds 

in june 2018 the borrowing capacity of the commercial paper program was increased from 750 million to 10 billion  under the terms of the program individual maturities on borrowings may vary but may not exceed one year from the date of issuance interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed notes or floating rate notes as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the company had 30 million and 465 million  respectively outstanding under this program

other financing activities during 2018 included the net repurchase of approximately 123 million shares of treasury stock including restricted stock tax withholding repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled 732 million including 700 million related to shares repurchased under the companys share repurchase program 

in october 2018 international paper announced that the quarterly dividend would be increased from 04750 per share to 050 per share effective for the 2018 fourth quarter 

interest rate swaps 

international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and manage interest expense at december 31 2019 and 2018 international paper had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 see note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 71 through 75 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  during 2019 and 2018 the inclusion of the offsetting interest income from shortterm investments reduced the effective interest rate from 48 to 44 and from 48 to 46  respectively 

variable interest entities 

information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 68 through 70 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands we received 48 billion of installment notes these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from thirdparty lenders these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and thirdparty loans were extended the restructured variable interest entities hold installment notes of 48 billion that mature in august 2021 unless extended and thirdparty loans of 42 billion that mature in the fourth quarter of 2020 unless extended these thirdparty loans are shown in current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we are evaluating alternatives for extending the installment notes and refinancing the thirdparty loans 

 

failure to extend renew or refinance these thirdparty loans prior to their stated maturity which we believe is unlikely could necessitate a disposition of the installment notes to facilitate the 42 billion debt payment which we are confident could be achieved 

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2020 

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2020 with current cash balances and cash from operations additionally the company has existing credit facilities totaling 21 billion at december 31 2019  

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2019  and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in our credit agreements 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2019  the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa2 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2019  were as follows   



 we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2019  to be permanently reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have 

been provided thereon see note 13 income taxes on pages 62 through 65 of i tem 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2019  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 15 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets excluding nonus plans approximately 12 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2018 or 2019 at this time we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2020  although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company entered into an agreement with the prudential insurance company of america to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately 16 billion of international papers us qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations subject to customary closing conditions the transaction closed on october 2 2018 and was funded with pension plan assets under the transaction at the end of 2018 prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 23000 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than 1000 in monthly benefit payments from the plan settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of october 2 2018 and the company recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of 424 million before tax in the fourth quarter of 2018 

 

ilim shareholders agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholders agreement are commenced although it is not obligated to do so the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners 50 interests would be approximately 16 billion which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the companys option the purchase by the company of its partners’ 50 interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilims financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder’s agreement 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including personal injury product liability environmental and other legal matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount 

of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and if applicable other experts liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs the company utilizes its inhouse legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal and environmental obligations supplemented as needed by thirdparty specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities 

we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors the workers compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate the ultimate settlement of workers compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test if a qualitative assessment is performed an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that based on that qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 

 

the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its north america industrial packaging european papers russian papers and brazilian papers reporting units and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its global cellulose fibers and emea industrial packaging reporting units as of october 1 2019 for this evaluation the company assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the qualitative assessment for the reporting units listed above and the result of the qualitative assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its north america industrial packaging european papers russian papers and brazilian papers reporting units were less than their carrying values 

the company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the global cellulose fibers and emea industrial packaging reporting units to their estimated fair value the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for global cellulose fibers due to the reporting units outlook and for emea industrial packaging due to the changes in the reporting units asset base as a result of strategic capital projects and acquisitions since the previous quantitative goodwill impairment test the company calculated the estimated 

fair value of its global cellulose fibers and emea industrial packaging reporting units using a probabilityweighted approach based on discounted future cash flows market multiples and transaction multiples the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit the carrying amount did exceed the estimated fair value of the global cellulose fibers reporting unit and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit totaling 52 million was impaired this impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 the decline in the fair value of global cellulose fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the global cellulose fibers reporting units operations 

in addition the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation in consideration of all relevant factors there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1 2019 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2018 

during 2018 a determination was made that the current carrying value of the longlived assets of the brazil packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value 

due to a change in the outlook for the business management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets the fair value of the business was calculated using a probabilityweighted approach based on discounted future cash flows market multiples and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach as a result a pretax charge of 122 million 81 million net of tax was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets 

pension benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2019  for international paper’s pension plan were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2019 was 725  

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2020 pension expense by approximately 24 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 31 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 92 and 98 for the past five and ten years respectively 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years 

net periodic pension plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2019 pension expense primarily reflects lower service cost due to the salaried pension freeze lower amortization and the absence of a settlement loss in the current year slightly offset by lower asset returns 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31 2019  projected future net periodic pension plan expenses would be as follows   



the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 46 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2020  compared to expense of 93 million in 2019  the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2020 is primarily due to higher return on assets and lower interest cost partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service cost 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2019 totaled approximately 102 billion  consisting of approximately 37 equity securities 50 debt securities 8 real estate funds and 5 other assets

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit 

 

will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 70 and 71 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 71 through 75 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2019 and 2018 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2019 and 2018  the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 98 billion and 92 billion  respectively the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 511 million and 538 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and 

operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2019 and 2018  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 16 million asset and an 8 million liability respectively 

the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 87 million and 29 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 47 million in 2018 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend 70 million in 2019 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures for 2020 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 70 million capital expenditures for 2021 environmental projects are estimated to be 95 million 

the company has completed capital projects to meet the us environmental protection agencys epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology regulations that require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances since 2016 lawsuits challenging all or portions of the boiler mact regulations have resulted in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit remanding certain portions of the boiler mact regulations to the epa for reconsideration of certain standards in the regulations we have not identified any additional boiler mact capital project expenditures that might result from the outcome of the remands to the epa 

amendments lowering national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 fine particulate pm25 and ozone have been finalized by the epa in recent years but to date have not had a material impact on the company 

climate change 

in an effort to mitigate the potential climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been or may be undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

a successor program to the 1997 kyoto protocol the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs consistent with this objective participating countries aim to balance ghg 

 

emissions generation and removal in the second half of this century or in effect achieve netzero global ghg emissions    

as part of the paris agreement many countries including the us and eu member states established nonbinding emissions reduction targets the us nonbinding commitment is for ghg emissions to be 7 below 2005 ghg emissions levels by 2020 and 26 to 28 below by 2025 other countries in which we do business made similar nonbinding commitments on august 4 2017 the us filed official notice to withdraw from the paris agreement notwithstanding the notice of withdrawal by the us the company’s voluntary ghg reductions which are set out in our annual global citizenship report remain roughly in line with the percentages of the us prior target reductions it is not clear at this time what if any further reductions by the company might be required by the countries in which we operate due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of these agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreements nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

us efforts including state regional and local measures 

in the us the 1997 kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation the epa manages regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year iv in 2015 require states to develop plans to reduce ghgs from utility egus and v in 2016 epa took the first steps in the process of developing emissions standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector   

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs california has already enacted such a program and similar actions are being 

considered by washington the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change in the future it is unclear when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

international paper plays a significant role in responding to the climate change challenge our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day this cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests and at the end of use our products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material we will continue to lead the world in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests furthermore we use biomass and manufacturing residuals rather than fossil fuels to generate a substantial majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper is available in our 2017 global citizenship report found on our website at wwwinternationalpapercom though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k including the exhibits hereto that are not historical in nature may be considered “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” 

“continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature these statements are not guarantees of future performance and reflect management’s current views with respect to future events which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements factors which could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to i the level of our indebtedness and changes in interest rates ii industry conditions including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation costs competition we face cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences demand and pricing for our products iii global economic conditions and political changes including but not limited to the impairment of financial institutions changes in currency exchange rates credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations the amount of our future pension funding obligation changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs iv unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation v whether we experience a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities vi risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture and vii our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from all acquisitions divestitures and restructurings these and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forwardlooking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “item 1a risk factors” we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance the board of directors exercises oversight of the company’s enterprise risk management program which includes strategic operational and financial matters as well as compliance and legal risks the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board’s standing committees and management and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s 

 

actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally biomass natural gas electricity and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries individual governments legislation and regulations as well as changes in the global economy in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause occasional significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future the availability of labor and the market price for diesel fuel may affect our costs for thirdparty transportation our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our products these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences or rulings nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries likewise disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries eg the us and china could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2018  international paper had approximately 107 billion  of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse 

effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 14 billion of our debt as of december 31 2018  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 538 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 14 variable interest entities  on pages 65  and 66  and note 

 

12 income taxes  on pages 58  through 62  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 or later for certain acquired populations as described in note 18 retirement plans  on pages 70  through 77  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date the company has frozen participation under these plans for us salaried employees including credited services and compensation on or after january 1 2019 however the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31 2018 we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us hourly employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs   

our pension plans are currently underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2018  was 18 billion  the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting 

customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not 

 

have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures capital investments and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper in january 2018 for example we completed a transaction transferring our north american consumer packaging business to graphic packaging in exchange for among other things an equity interest in the combined business of 205 the success of the transaction and the value of our equity interest will depend on variables we do not control such as the financial performance of the combined business and on the ability of the combined business to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies   

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes  our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyber attacks or natural disasters network system application and data 

breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity government enforcement and could have a material effect on our business 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax trade and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs 

for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to 

 

contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

as another example we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally we are subject to complex and evolving us and international privacy laws and regulations including those pertaining to the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation gdpr government authorities around the world are considering or are in the process of implementing new data protection regulations many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses 

as a final example the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities additionally administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently we are currently subject to tax audits in the us brazil poland russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world in some cases we have appealed and may continue to appeal assessments by taxing authorities in the court system as such tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected

looking ahead to the first quarter 2019 domestic industry conditions remain healthy we anticipate lower seasonal demand in north america industrial packaging and brazil papers as well as lower export volume in industrial packaging as customer destocking continues in global cellulose fibers we anticipate lower volume due to slower growth in developing markets and customer destocking as well as a temporary setback in fluff pulp volume resulting from poor execution of a mix improvement plan consequently we expect downward pressure on export price and mix in industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers during the first quarter operating costs are expected to increase in our three business segments due to lower volume higher seasonal energy consumption and timing of spending in addition planned maintenance outage expense is expected to increase significantly as we move from a lowoutage fourth quarter to a heavyoutage first quarter with firsthalf 2019 representing nearly 80 of total planned maintenance outage expense in 2019 input costs are expected to be stable in industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers and increase modestly in printing papers mainly due to higher wood costs in north america lastly we expect equity earnings for our ilim joint venture to remain stable in the first quarter

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs the company utilizes its inhouse legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal and environmental obligations supplemented as needed by thirdparty specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities 

we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors the workers compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate the ultimate settlement of workers compensation reserves 

 

may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations or disposals a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on that step 0 assessment it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 

during 2018 a determination was made that the current carrying value of the longlived assets of the brazil packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value due to a change in the outlook for the business management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets the fair value of the business was calculated using a probabilityweighted approach based on discounted future cash flows market multiples and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach as a result a pretax charge of 122 million   81 million  net of tax was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets 

the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units as of october 1 2018 for the current year evaluation the company assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated 

fair value of the reporting units the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the companys reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units 

in addition the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation in consideration of all relevant factors there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1 2018 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2018 2017 or 2016 

pension benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2018  for international paper’s pension plan were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical 

 

settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2018  was 750  

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2019  pension expense by approximately 22 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 27 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 60  and 98  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2008 – 2018 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive 

benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years 

net periodic pension plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2018 pension expense primarily reflects lower interest cost on a lower 2018 projected benefit obligation along with the current year absence of a curtailment loss and special termination benefits associated with the north american consumer packaging transaction partially offset by a higher settlement loss in the current year associated with the october 2018 annuity purchase transaction 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31 2018  projected future net periodic pension plan expenses would be as follows   



the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 103 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2019  compared to expense of 632 million  in 2018  the 2018 expense includes 424 million  of settlement accounting charges excluding these settlement charges the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2019 is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses and lower service cost partially offset by lower asset returns due to the annuity purchase and a decrease in the expected longterm return on asset assumption from 750 in 2018 to 725 in 2019 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2018  totaled approximately 87 billion  consisting of approximately 32  equity securities 51  debt securities 11  real estate funds and 6  other assets 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and 

 

could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there are no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2019 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 29 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results 

in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 15 debt and lines of credit  on pages 66  and 67  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 16 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 67  through 70  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in 

 

investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2018  and 2017  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 92 billion  and 111 billion  respectively the potential decline in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 538 million  and 679 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2018  and 2017  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 8 million  liability and a 10 million  asset respectively 

the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 29 million  at both december 31 2018  and 2017

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 86 million in 2017 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend 71 million in 2018 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures for 2019 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 87 million capital 

 

expenditures for 2020 environmental projects are estimated to be 73 million 

the 2017 spend included costs associated with the us environmental protection agencys epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology regulations that require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances several lawsuits were filed to challenge all or portions of the boiler mact regulations on december 23 2016 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit remanded the boiler mact regulations to the epa requiring the agency to revise emission standards for boiler subcategories that had been affected by flawed calculations the court determined that the existing mact standards should remain in place while the revised standards are being developed but did not establish a deadline for the epa to complete the rulemaking the company has completed its boiler mact capital projects to meet the existing regulations we are not able to project any additional boiler mact capital project expenditures as it is uncertain to what extent the epa will revise boiler mact standards that are subject to the remand 

amendments lowering national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 fine particulate pm25 and ozone have been finalized by the epa in recent years but to date have not had a material impact on the company 

climate change 

in an effort to mitigate the potential climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been or may be undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

a successor program to the 1997 kyoto protocol the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs consistent with this objective participating countries aim to balance ghg emissions generation and removal in the second half of this century or in effect achieve netzero global ghg emissions    

as part of the paris agreement many countries including the us and eu member states established nonbinding emissions reduction targets the us nonbinding commitment is for ghg emissions to be 7 below 2005 ghg emissions levels by 2020 and 26 to 28 below by 2025 other countries in which we do business made similar nonbinding commitments on 

august 4 2017 the us filed official notice to withdraw from the paris agreement notwithstanding the notice of withdrawal by the us the company’s voluntary ghg reductions which are set out in our annual global citizenship report remain roughly in line with the percentages of the us prior target reductions it is not clear at this time what if any further reductions by the company might be required by the countries in which we operate due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of these agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreements nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

us efforts 

in the us the 1997 kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation the epa however enacted regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year iv in 2015 require states to develop plans to reduce ghgs from utility egus and v in 2016 epa took the first steps in the process of developing emissions standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector   the 2017 change in leadership of the us executive branch may result in significant revisions to or rescission of the epas ghg regulations it is unclear what impacts if any the epas ghg regulatory revisions and any other future revisions will have on the company’s operations 

in 2015 epa promulgated the clean power plan cpp rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide co2 and other designated greenhouse gas pollutant emissions from utility egus in response states were to develop and begin implementing programs to reduce ghgs from egus by about 32 percent by the 2022 to 2033 timeframe as compared to 2005 baseline levels in october 2017 the epa issued a regulatory action to withdraw the cpp in its entirety notwithstanding the withdrawal of the cpp some states have remained committed to reaching the reduction targets set out in the cpp these ghg reduction plans 

 

if implemented could pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the company the magnitude of cost increases to the company if any are not possible to estimate reliably at this time 

state regional and local measures 

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs california has already enacted such a program and similar actions are being considered by oregon the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan and since the oregon program is still being developed it is too early to know how or if company owned sites in oregon may be affected there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to the withdrawal of the epa’s cpp 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

international paper plays a significant role in responding to the climate change challenge our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day this cycle begins with 

sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests and at the end of use our products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material we will continue to lead the world in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests furthermore we use biomass and manufacturing residuals rather than fossil fuels to generate a substantial majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper is available in our 2016 global citizenship report found on our internet web site at wwwinternationalpapercom though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we have approximately 56000  employees nearly 36000  of whom are located in the united states of the us employees approximately 25000  are hourly with unions representing approximately 15000  employees approximately 12000  of this number are represented by the united steelworkers union usw 

international paper the usw and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities these master agreements cover several specific items including wages select benefit programs successorship employment security and health and safety individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements if local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect the master agreements cover the majority of our union represented mills and converting facilities in addition international paper is party to a master agreement with district council 2 international brotherhood of teamsters covering additional converting facilities

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k including the exhibits hereto that are not historical in nature may be considered “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature these statements are not guarantees of future performance and reflect management’s current views with respect to future events which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements factors which could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to i the level of our indebtedness and changes in interest rates ii industry conditions including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation costs competition we face cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences demand and pricing for our products iii global economic conditions and political changes including but not limited to the 

impairment of financial institutions changes in currency exchange rates credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations the amount of our future pension funding obligation changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs iv unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation v whether we experience a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities vi risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture and vii our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from all acquisitions divestitures and restructurings these and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “item 1a risk factors” we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and 

 

cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our products these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2017  international paper had approximately 112 billion of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 



operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 14 billion of our debt as of december 31 2017  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment 

 

circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 538 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 12 variable interest entities  on pages 63  through 64  and note 10 income taxes  on pages 57  through 60  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us hourly employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs   

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be 

required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2017  was 20 billion  the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries likewise disruption in existing trade agreements eg nafta or increased trade friction between countries eg the us and china could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs 

for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

as another example we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the adoption of the european union of the general data protection regulation gdpr which will become effective may 2018 creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data compliance with the stringent rules under gdpr will require an extensive review of our global data processing systems which is ongoing a failure to comply with gdpr could result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4 of annual global revenues whichever is higher 

as a final example in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code for a discussion of the immediate and potential impacts to the company of the tax act and the uncertainties around the companys current estimates of such impacts see note 10 income taxes  

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes  our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyber attacks or natural disasters network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper 

on january 1 2018 for example we completed a transaction transferring our north american consumer packaging business to graphic packaging in exchange for among other things an equity interest in the combined business of 205 as of immediately following the closing and the assumption by the combined business of 660 million of indebtedness that we incurred prior to closing of the transaction the success of the transaction will depend in part on the financial performance of the combined business and on the ability of the combined business to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies the success of the combined business in realizing these growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies and the timing of this realization will depend on the successful integration of our north american consumer packaging business with graphic packagings business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper delivered a year of strong performance in 2017 driven by excellent commercial execution across our businesses our global cellulose fibers business is on track to achieve the estimated transaction synergies we continued to grow value for our shareholders with our return on invested capital solidly exceeding our cost of capital for the eighth consecutive year we made substantial progress in further strengthening our portfolio during 2017 we accelerated strategic investments for growth in the industrial packaging business providing the company with the flexibility we need around capacity products and geography to support our customers in addition the company made an important strategic move to transfer the north american consumer packaging business which included the north american coated paperboard and foodservice businesses to a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company this strategic move enables us to focus on growing value in our core businesses and establish a 205 ownership interest in the subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company that holds the assets of the combined business finally we generated strong free cash flow which enabled us to increase our annual dividend for the sixth consecutive year 

our 2017 results reflect significant pricing and mix improvement which accelerated throughout the year the improvement in price and mix was primarily driven by price realization on price increases announced in prior quarters in our north american industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses operations were negatively impacted by hurricanes and the pensacola event earlier in the year however 2017 was a lower maintenance outage year input costs were higher compared to 2016 driven by significantly higher recovered fiber costs as well as higher energy and transportation costs during the latter part of the year our ilim joint venture delivered solid operational and financial results driven by pricing and strong volume and provided more than 130 million in cash dividends to international paper in 2017 finally our 2017 results reflect the provisional net tax benefit associated with the impact of the december 2017 enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act 

looking ahead to the 2018 first quarter overall industry conditions are expected to remain strong and we should continue to benefit from announced price increases cost reduction initiatives and additional synergies we expect higher export price realization in our north american industrial packaging business and improved pricing in our printing papers segment as price increases 

 

implemented in 2017 are realized we also expect 2018 first quarter sales volumes for north american industrial packaging and brazil papers to be down due to seasonally lower demand our north american mill operations have been affected by the severe cold weather experienced at the beginning of 2018 which is expected to impact operating costs costs will be higher in our european packaging business related to the madrid mill conversion in addition planned maintenance outages are expected to increase due to a heavy outage quarter as 70 of the company outages are planned during the first half of 2018 input costs are expected to increase across our businesses driven by higher wood energy and transportation costs additionally we expect equity earnings for ilim to be sequentially higher driven by price realization across the pulp portfolio which will be partly offset by seasonally lower volumes 

looking to full year 2018 our focus will be on value creation in our growth businesses we anticipate another year of strong growth driven by a continued strong outlook in our core businesses and the fullyear price flow through of the 2017 increases we continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our portfolio we expect higher maintenance outage expenses due to the calendar impact of mills on an eighteenmonth cycle and extended outages at several of our mills as we position them for longer maintenance cycle schedules in the future we are planning for 15 billion in capital expenditures in 2018 including approximately 500 million that will be invested in strategic projects including the madrid mill conversion and the riverdale conversion also we will see the positive cash tax impact associated with tax reform our ilim joint venture is well positioned for another strong year of performance and we will start to see the benefits of our investment in graphic packaging all in we expect another year of strong cash generation enabling us to continue to allocate capital to grow value for our shareholders 

adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are nongaap measures and are defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense diluted earnings loss and diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders are the most direct comparable gaap measures the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap nonoperating pension expense includes all us pension costs excluding service costs and prior service costs and discontinued operations adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors 

because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations 

the following are reconciliations of diluted earnings loss attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders   





 





free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available after reinvesting in the business to maintain a strong balance sheet pay dividends repurchase stock repay debt and make investments for future growth it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the companys ongoing performance free cash flow also enables 

investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods 

the company generated free cash flow of approximately 20 billion  19 billion  and 18 billion  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations   





results of operations 

business segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes business segment operating profits are defined as earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests excluding corporate items and corporate special items business segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in three segments industrial packaging global cellulose fibers and printing papers during 2017 as a result of the transfer of the north american coated paperboard business and the associated reclassification of this business to discontinued operations the remaining sales and operating profits previously reported in the consumer 

 

packaging segment have been reclassified for segment reporting for all periods presented the european coated paperboard business is now included in the industrial packaging segment and sales and earnings historically included in the consumer packaging segment associated with previously divested businesses are now included in corporate items 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings loss from continuing operations attributable to international paper company to its total business segment operating profit 

  



business segment operating profits in 2017  included a net loss from special items of 425 million compared with 127 million in 2016  and 137 million in 2015    operationally compared with 2016 the benefits from higher average sales price realizations and mix 605 million higher sales volumes 33 million lower maintenance outage costs 55 million and the incremental operating earnings from the pulp business acquired in late 2016 117 million were offset by higher operating costs 172 million higher input costs 362 million and higher other costs 11 million 

corporate items includes operating profits losses of previously divested businesses of 0 million in 2017 2 million in 2016 and 62 million in 2015 

  

the principal changes in operating profit by business segment were as follows 

  



 

for the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with that acquisition

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 sales volumes for boxes are expected to be seasonally lower despite two more shipping days shipments of containerboard to export markets are also expected to decrease average sales price realizations should reflect the continuing realization of containerboard export price increases input costs are expected to be higher for wood energy and chemicals planned maintenance downtime spending is expected to be about 53 million higher operating costs are expected to be negatively impacted by the severe winter weather conditions in the 2018 first quarter 



emea industrial packagings  sales volumes in 2017 were higher than in 2016 reflecting improved market demand particularly in morocco and turkey while sales volumes in the eurozone were negatively impacted by poor weather conditions average sales margins improved due to sales price increases and a more favorable mix that more than offset higher containerboard costs and the impact of unfavorable currency translation input costs for energy were higher and operating costs were negatively impacted by inflation 

entering the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower average sales margins are expected to be lower due to continuing higher containerboard prices operating costs will be higher due to the the conversion of the madrid mill

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

cash uses during 2017  were primarily focused on working capital requirements capital spending debt reductions pension contributions and returning cash to shareholders

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2017  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 19 billion  higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 15 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefitsthe projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as 

well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling 1250 million   and 750 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively at this time we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2018  although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company entered into an agreement with the prudential insurance company of america to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately 13 billion  of international papers us qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations the transaction closed on october 3 2017 and was funded with pension plan assets under the transaction at the end of 2017 prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 45000  retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than 450  in monthly benefit payments from the plan settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of october 3 2017 and the company recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of 376 million  before tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition large payments from the nonqualified pension plan also required a remeasurement as of october 2 2017 and a noncash settlement charge of 7 million  was also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments 

regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs 

we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors the workers compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate the ultimate settlement of workers compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative step 0 assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test if a step 0 assessment is performed an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that based on that step 0 assessment it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 

the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units as of october 1 2017 for the current year test the company assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not 

 

that the fair values of the companys reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units 

in addition the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test in consideration of all relevant factors there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1 2017 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for goodwill impairment the company calculated the estimated fair value of its brazil packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business totaling 137 million should be written off the decline in the fair value of the brazil packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall brazilian economy 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2017  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



additionally health care cost trend rates and other assumptions used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2017  was 750  

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2018  pension expense by approximately 27 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 35 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1  increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and temple 

 

inland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 94  and 72  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2007 – 2017 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 327 million  and 17 million  respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2017  us pension expense reflects lower settlement losses and lower actuarial losses partially offset by lower asset returns due to the annuity purchase as well as curtailment and special termination benefit charges 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31 2017  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows   



the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 167 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2018  compared to expense of 717 million  in 2017  the 2017 expense includes 45 million  of curtailment and special pension benefits associated with the north american consumer packaging business and 383 million  of settlement accounting charges excluding these settlement charges and curtailment and special pension benefits the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2018 is primarily due to lower interest cost on the reduced pension obligation and a higher expected return on assets associated with the increased pension asset balance 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2017  totaled approximately 114 billion  consisting of approximately 49  equity securities 36  debt securities 10  real estate and 5  other assets 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there are no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2018 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 40 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income 

tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on 

 

specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 128  24  and 37  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily driven by the recent us tax legislation in december 2017 see note 10 income taxes  on pages 57  through 60  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur however as a result of recent us tax legislation which includes a reduction of the us income tax rate from 35 to 21 we will have a lower worldwide effective income tax rate going forward excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2017  was 30  of pretax earnings compared with 32  in 2016  and 33  in 2015  we estimate that the 2018  effective income tax rate will be approximately 2527 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

business combinations 

the company’s acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with asc 805 business combinations   as amended  we allocate the total consideration of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date in developing estimates of fair values for longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets the company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows anticipated growth rates discount rates estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such 

as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment we may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period not to exceed one year upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit  on pages 64  and 65  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 65  through 69  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2017  and 2016  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 111 billion  and 113 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 679 million  and 623 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contract at december 31 2017  and 2016  was approximately a 8 million  and a 2 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 1 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2017  and 2016  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 10 million  asset and a 1 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 29 million  and 23 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively

the company operates its primary research and development center in loveland ohio as well as several other product development facilities including the global cellulose fibers technology center in federal way washington that was acquired in 2016 additionally the company has an interest in arborgen inc a joint venture with certain other forest products companies 

we direct research and development activities to shortterm longterm and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions and to process equipment and product innovations activities include product development within the operating divisions studies on innovation and improvement of pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking converting and coating processes packaging design and materials development mechanical packaging systems environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges reuse of raw materials in manufacturing processes recycling of consumer and packaging paper products energy conservation applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations innovations and improvement of products and development of various new products our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste the cost to the company of its research and development operations was 20 million  in 2016  27 million  in 2015  and 16 million  in 2014

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 83 million in 2016 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste the 2016 spend 

 

included   costs associated with the us environmental protection agency’s epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology   regulations we expect to spend 111 million in 2017 for environmental capital projects capital expenditures for 2018 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 54 million capital expenditures for 2019 environmental projects are estimated to be 51 million on january 31 2013 epa issued the final suite of boiler mact regulations these regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the boiler mact regulations on december 23 2016 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit remanded the boiler mact regulations to epa requiring the agency to revise emission standards for boiler subcategories that had been affected by flawed calculations the court determined that the existing mact standards should remain in place while the revised standards are being developed but did not establish a deadline for epa to complete the rulemaking as such the projected capital expenditures for environmental projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the boiler mact regulations could change as a result of new revised standards 

amendments lowering national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 fine particulate pm25 and ozone have been finalized in recent years but to date have not had a material impact on the company 

climate change 

climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature precipitation or winds that persist for decades or longer climate change can be caused by natural factors such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere such as from the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

a successor program to the 1997 kyoto protocol the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 which continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing greenhouse gasses ghgs consistent with this objective participating 

countries aim to balance ghg emissions generation and removal in the second half of this century or in effect achieve a netzero global ghg emissions    as part of the paris agreement many countries including the us and eu member states established nonbinding emissions reduction targets the us nonbinding commitment is for ghg emissions to be 7 below 2005 ghg emissions levels by 2020 and 26 to 28 below by 2025 other countries in which we do business made similar nonbinding commitments the company’s voluntary ghg reductions which are set out in the annual global reporting initiative gri report are roughly in line with the percentages of the us target reductions it is not clear at this time what if any further reductions by the company might be required by the countries in which we operate due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the paris agreement nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years 

national efforts 

in the us the 1997 kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation epa however has enacted regulations to i control ghgs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards ii control ghg emissions from new electric generating units egus iii require reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year iv in 2015 require states to develop plans to reduce ghgs from utility electric generating units egus and v in 2016 epa took the first steps in the process of developing emissions standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector   the epa has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the sectors to be covered by new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources may be subject to new ghg nsps rules it is unclear what impacts if any future ghg nsps rules will have on the company’s operations 

in 2015 epa promulgated the clean power plan cpp rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide co2 and other designated greenhouse gas pollutant emissions from utility egus in response 

 

states are to develop and begin implementing programs to reduce ghgs from egus by about 32 percent by the 2022 to 2033 timeframe as compared to 2005 baseline levels these plans if implemented could pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the company the magnitude of cost increases to the company if any are not possible to estimate reliably at this time adding to the uncertainty states and some industry parties have filed lawsuits challenging the rule and on february 9 2016 the us supreme court granted a stay of the clean power plan the stay will remain in effect until final disposition of the case and as such the rule’s potential impact on the company remains unclear 

state regional and local measures 

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs california has already enacted such a program and similar actions are being considered by oregon the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan and since the oregon program is still being developed it is too early to know how or if company owned sites in oregon may be affected there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to epa’s 2015 clean power plan and develop an implementation plan over the next 1 to 3 years the cpp allows significant flexibility in how states develop their plans so the uncertainty regarding potential impacts will remain high until more specificity is reached and individual power companies develop their compliance strategies 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes 

causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper is available in our 2015 global reporting initiative gri report found at httpwwwinternationalpapercomdocsdefaultsourceenglishsustainability2015grireportpdfsfvrsn26 though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies 

pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2016  international paper had approximately 113 billion of outstanding indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 



 

in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 23 billion of our debt as of december 31 2016  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade as a result a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of 

the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 831 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 12 variable interest entities  on pages 64 through 66 and note 10 income taxes  on pages 59 through 61 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former us hourly employees as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former us salaried employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs   health care reform under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 and modifications thereto could also increase costs with respect to medical coverage of the company’s fulltime employees significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2016  was 34 billion  the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment data privacy and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and 

regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances as another example we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 



 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

for example on january 22 2017 we experienced significant structural damage to the largest pulp digester as well as the power house at our pensacola pulp and paper mill in cantonment florida we restarted the power house and resumed partial operations producing fluff pulp at the mill using a series of small batch digesters within a couple weeks repairing the damaged digester will take more time however and we know that we will not be able to resume full operations producing containerboard at the mill during the first quarter of 2017 

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes  our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design 

implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyber attacks or natural disasters network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so we receive only our portion of those benefits 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets 

 

than does international paper 

on december 1 2016 for example we completed our acquisition of weyerhaeusers pulp business the success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the acquired business with our existing businesses the integration process may be complex costly and timeconsuming and we may not accomplish the integration of the business smoothly successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe potential integration risks include among other things our ability to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business and retain key customers suppliers and employees

executive summary 

diluted earnings loss attributable to common shareholders were 904 million   218  per share in 2016  compared with 938 million   223  per share in 2015  and 555 million   129  per share in 2014  adjusted operating earnings is a nongaap measure and is defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense international paper generated adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders of 14 billion   335  per share in 2016  compared with 15 billion   365  per share in 2015  and 13 billion   300  per share in 2014  see reconciliation on page 19 

despite a tough global environment international paper delivered another year of solid performance with continued strong cash flow generation and a return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital during 2016 we took steps to further strengthen our portfolio we completed the acquisition of weyerhaeuser’s pulp business which we have combined with ip’s legacy pulp business to form our new global cellulose fibers business we also completed the conversion of a machine at the riegelwood north carolina mill to produce fluff pulp which coupled with the newly acquired pulp business gives the company the capacity to grow both fluff and highvalue specialty pulp products in addition we also acquired a topquartile mill asset in madrid which we will convert in the second half of 2017 to produce recycled containerboard to support our emea industrial packaging business finally we were able to return cash to our shareholders in the form of a 5 increase in the annual dividend making it the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase 

our 2016 results reflect margin pressure across most of our businesses throughout the year along with escalating input costs primarily natural gas and occ in the later portion of the year fullyear 2016 earnings were impacted by price erosion and weaker mix across many of our businesses in particular our north american industrial packaging business which experienced lower export pricing and the impact of early 2016 pricing index changes to boxes volume was positive compared to 2015 primarily driven by increased north american box demand manufacturing operations despite solid performance across our mill systems were negatively impacted by the riegelwood conversion and ramp up hurricane matthew and inventory valuation charges associated with the october containerboard price increase we did see signs of strengthening in some of our key markets in the second half of the year which enabled us to announce and implement price increases 

 

across various businesses that will benefit us in 2017 our ilim joint venture had another solid year in 2016 experiencing strong demand which led to record fullyear production 

looking ahead to the 2017 first quarter we expect sales volumes for north american industrial packaging to be slightly higher despite seasonally lower daily shipments due to four more shipping days sales volumes for global cellulose fibers will be higher due to the fullquarter impact of the newly acquired pulp business in addition sales volumes for emea industrial packaging north american printing papers and north american consumer packaging are also expected to be seasonally higher pricing is expected to increase for both north american industrial packaging and brazilian industrial packaging reflecting the continuing implementation of box price increases announced in 2016 pricing for both north american printing papers and north american consumer packaging is expected to be lower due to market pressures planned maintenance outages are expected to increase due to a heavy outage quarter including a significant outage currently underway at the global cellulose fibers port wentworth mill input costs are expected to increase primarily for our north american operations largely driven by natural gas wood and occ additionally we expect the results of ilim to be sequentially lower primarily due to seasonally lower volumes and seasonally higher input costs 

looking to full year 2017 we are encouraged by an improving economic climate and are eager to begin the integration of our newly acquired pulp business driving the anticipated synergies to the bottom line we expect higher earnings in our north american industrial packaging business through benefits from the previously announced price increase growing demand from our customers and improvement initiatives we also expect to improve margins with continued strong operations and extensive cost reduction efforts across many of our other businesses additionally we are on track for our planned conversion of the madrid mill in the second half of the year which will enable a better offering for our customers and earnings improvement for our emea industrial packaging business finally with the strong cash flow that we expect from all of these initiatives we will continue to allocate capital to create value with a nearterm focus on debt reduction and returning value to our shareholders 

adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are nongaap measures diluted earnings loss and diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders are the most direct comparable gaap measures the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap nonoperating pension expense includes all us pension costs excluding service costs and prior service costs and 

discontinued operations adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations 

diluted earnings loss attributable to common shareholders were 053  in the 2016 fourth quarter compared with 075  in the 2016 third quarter and 043  in the 2015 fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders of 303 million   073  per share in the 2016 fourth quarter were lower than both the 380 million   091  per share in the 2016 third quarter and the 361 million   087  per share in the 2015 fourth quarter 

the following are reconciliations of diluted earnings loss attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders   





 





free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available after reinvesting in the business to maintain a strong balance sheet pay dividends repurchase stock repay debt and make investments for future growth it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the companys ongoing performance free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between 

past and present periods free cash flow of 19 billion  generated in 2016  was higher than the 18 billion  generated in 2015  but lower than the 21 billion  generated in 2014  see reconciliation on page 30 

free cash flow of 467 million  generated in the 2016  fourth quarter was lower than the 575 million  generated in the 2016  third quarter and the 501 million  generated in the 2015  fourth quarter see reconciliation on page 30 

results of operations 

business segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes business segment operating profits are defined as earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests excluding corporate items and corporate special items business segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

and lower input costs were partially offset by lower sales volumes lower average sales price realizations and mix and higher other costs in addition operating profits in 2016 included a charge of 9 million related to the conversion of our riegelwood mill to 100 pulp production in 2015 operating losses included an asset impairment charge of 174 million related to the sale of our 55 equity share of the ipsun jv in asia a net cost of 8 million related to costs for our riegelwood mill conversion net of proceeds from the sale of the carolina coated bristols brand and 2 million of sheet plant closure costs 

liquidity and capital resources

we expect strong cash generation again in 2017  and will continue our balanced use of cash through the payment of dividends reducing total debt and making investments for future growth 

capital spending for 2017  is targeted at 15 billion  or about 107  of depreciation and amortization

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably 

 

estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one 

the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit discounted using the estimated discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its brazil packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business totaling 137 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the brazil packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall brazilian economy 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its asia industrial packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business totaling 100 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the asia industrial packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount 

 

rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2016  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2016  was 775  

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2017  pension expense by approximately 26 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 33 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1   

increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 85  and 63  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2006 – 2016 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 341 million  and 28 million  respectively 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the increase in 2016  us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate and a large settlement charge in 2016 related to the optional lump sum payout partially offset by a higher return on assets and lower amortization of actuarial losses 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2016  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows   



 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 310 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2017  with the decrease from expense of 809 million  in 2016  mainly related to no expected settlement charges in 2017 and an increase in the assumed discount rate to 410 in 2017 from 405 in 2016 partially offset by a lower return on asset assumption of 750 in 2017 down from 775 in 2016 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2016  totaled approximately 103 billion  consisting of approximately 51  equity securities 27  debt securities 10  real estate and 12  other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate 

considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there are no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2017 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 21 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income 

tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on 

specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 26  37  and 14  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2016  was 32  of pretax earnings compared with 33  in 2015  and 31  in 2014  we estimate that the 2017  effective income tax rate will 

 

be approximately 33 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

business combinations 

the company’s acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with asc 805 business combinations   as amended  we allocate the total purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date in developing estimates of fair values for longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets the company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows anticipated growth rates discount rates estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment we may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period not to exceed one year upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods 

recent accounting developments 

there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 2 recent accounting developments  on pages 49 through 52 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

  market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit  on pages 66 and 67 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 67 through 70 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2016  and 2015  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate 

 

risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to execute this strategy at december 31 2016  and 2015  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 113 billion  and 93 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 623 million  and 565 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2016  and 2015  was approximately a 2 million  and a 7 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 1 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2016  and 2015  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 1 million  liability and a 4 million  asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 23 million  and 30 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 93 million in 2015 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste the 2015 spend included   costs associated with the us environmental protection agency’s epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology   regulations we expect 

 

to spend 118 million in 2016 for similar capital projects capital expenditures for 2017 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately 114 million capital expenditures for 2018 environmental projects are estimated to be 83 million on january 31 2013 epa issued the final suite of boiler mact regulations these regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the boiler mact regulations on december 3 2015 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit heard oral arguments of the petitioners challenging these regulations as such the projected capital expenditures for environmental projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the boiler mact regulations could change as a result of the pending court decision 

in the us revisions to national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 and fine particulate pm25 finalized between 2010 and 2012 and a promulgated revision to the naaqs for ozone on october 1 2015 have not had a material impact on the company similarly regulations addressing specific implementation issues related to the so2 naaqs were released in 2015 by the epa and are being implemented during the next two to four years potentially material capital investment may be required in response to these emerging requirements but evaluations are ongoing 

climate change 

climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature precipitation or winds that persist for decades or longer climate change can be caused by natural factors such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere such as from the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

the 1997 kyoto protocol established emission reduction obligations for certain countries where the company had and continues to have operations though the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 several countries and most notably the european union eu extended their emissions commitments until 2020 a successor program to the kyoto protocol is the subject 

of ongoing international negotiations including a conference of the parties cop21 to the kyoto protocol cop21 took place in december 2015 and although well short of reaching another international agreement many countries including the us and eu member states did establish nonbinding emissions reduction targets the us nonbinding commitment is for greenhouse gas ghg emissions to be 26 to 28 below 2005 ghg emissions levels by 2025 other countries in which we do business made similar nonbinding commitments the company’s voluntary ghg reductions which are set out in the company’s annual sustainability report are roughly in line with the percentages of the us nonbinding commitment it is not clear at this time what if any further reductions by the company might be required by the countries in which we operate due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how the 2015 nonbinding commitments or allocation of and market prices for ghg credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years

in the us the kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation epa has enacted i regulations to control ghgs from mobile sources through transportation fuel efficiency standards ii new source performance standards nsps for new electrica generating units egus iii regulations requiring reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year and iv in 2015 requirements for states to develop plans to reduce ghgs from utility electric generating units egus in 2015 the company reported to epa the ghg emissions from 21 of our us manufacturing sites and 9 landfills 

on november 19 2014 epa issued a revised draft carbon accounting framework addressing the circumstances under which biomass combustion can be considered carbon neutral epa has stated it intends to issue future rulemakings to address how states may use the revised framework in implementing state permit rules and in developing plans for regulating ghgs from utility electric generators given the uncertainties 

 

regarding the framework and scope of future ghg rulemaking it is unclear what impacts if any epa’s actions in this area will have on the company’s operations to date there have been only minor permitting considerations and no substantive impacts 

in 2013 epa issued final regulations establishing nsps for new egus this regulation is the first of several expected nspss that epa will implement over the coming years the epa has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources may be subject to new ghg nsps rules it is unclear what impacts if any future ghg nsps rules will have on the company’s operations 

on august 3 2015 epa promulgated the clean power plan cpp rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide co2 and other designated green house gas pollutant emissions from utility egus in response states are to develop egu pollutant reduction plans over the next 1 to 3 years to reduce emissions over the 2022 to 2033 timeframe by about 32 percent from 2005 levels these plans or the federal plan that would take effect if the states do not act pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the company epa estimated that the proposed rule would increase purchased electricity prices by less than seven percent but some utilities are estimating significantly higher price increases from the final rule 11 to 14 or more the magnitude of the cost increase to the company will not be possible to estimate reliably until the plans and the utility industries’ responses are better defined over the next few years adding to the uncertainty states and some industry parties have filed lawsuits challenging the rule the result of which could materially affect the scope and stringency of the regulations on february 9 2016 the us supreme court granted a stay of the clean power plan the stay will remain in effect until final disposition of the case and as such the rule’s potential impact on the company remains unclear 

state regional and local measures 

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs one such state is california the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will 

have on the company’s operations further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to epa’s 2015 clean power plan and develop an implementation plan over the next 1 to 3 years the cpp allows significant flexibility in how states develop their plans so the uncertainty regarding potential impacts will remain high until more specificity is reached and individual power companies develop their compliance strategies 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k that are not historical in nature may be considered “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature these statements are not guarantees of future performance and reflect management’s current views with respect to future events which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements factors which could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to i the level of our indebtedness and changes in interest rates ii industry conditions including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation costs competition we face cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences demand and pricing for our products iii global economic conditions and political changes including but not limited to the impairment of financial institutions changes in currency exchange rates credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations the amount of our future pension funding obligation changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs iv unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation v whether we experience a material disruption at one of our

all financial information and statistical measures regarding our 5050 ilim joint venture in russia “ilim” other than historical international paper equity earnings and dividends received by international paper have been prepared by the management of ilim in providing this information in this filing we are relying on the effectiveness of ilims internal control environment any projected financial information and statistical measures reflect the current views of ilim management and are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such projections 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes 

 

in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2015  international paper had approximately 93 billion of outstanding indebtedness including 93 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes there was no indebtedness outstanding under our 

credit facilities as of december 31 2015  the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our 

 

dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 25 billion of our debt as of december 31 2015  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating as a result a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to templeinland in connection with templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2007 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 840 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 12 variable interest entities  on pages 64 through 66 and note 10 income taxes  on pages 59 through 61 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 

pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs   health care reform under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 could also increase costs with respect to medical coverage of the company’s fulltime employees significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2015  was 36 billion the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates as described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k during the first half of 2016 former employees who are participants in our pension plan will be able to request early payment of their entire plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment while all payments will be made from the plans trust assets the target population has a total liability of 30 billion for further information see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   liquidity and capital resources  on page 34 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive 

 

advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances as another example we are subject to a number of labor 

and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 



 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes  our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to employee error or malfeasance cyber attacks or natural disasters network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture ilim in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources 

as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent strategic acquisitions joint ventures divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers placing higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

operating earnings a nongaap measure is defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense international paper generated operating earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of 365  in 2015  compared with 300  in 2014  and 306  in 2013  diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 223  in 2015  compared with 129  in 2014  and 311  in 2013  

international paper delivered solid results during 2015 driven by strong margins and earnings in our north american industrial packaging business and record performance from the ilim joint venture we generated 18 billion of free cash flow which enabled the company to return cash to our shareholders in the form of approximately 500 million in share repurchases and a 10 increase in the quarterly dividend beginning with the 2015 fourth quarter dividend payment during 2015 we successfully completed the restructuring of the 2006 timber monetization to achieve our objectives of reducing risk and preserving financial flexibility while maintaining the deferral of 14 billion of deferred income taxes finally with respect to our balanced use of cash we completed a 2 billion bond issue and related tender offer along with making a 750 million voluntary pension contribution 

our 2015 results reflect the benefits of favorable input costs offset by price and mix declines across our north american businesses volumes were generally flat compared to 2014 except for lower volumes in our north american industrial packaging business due to lower containerboard export tons input costs decreased versus 2014 largely due to lower energy chemicals and freight costs price declined relative to 2014 driven mainly by lower pricing in our north american industrial packaging and printing papers and pulp businesses our ilim joint venture generated record results in 2015 driven by improved operations and increased margins the positive results were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of noncash foreign currency movements associated with ilim’s us dollar denominated debt finally during 2015 we completed the divestiture of our interest in the ipsun joint venture generating 23 million in cash proceeds and removing approximately 400 million of debt from our balance sheet upon completion of the deal 

overall 2015 reflects solid performance in what continues to be a challenging economic environment we once again generated returns in excess of our cost of capital while returning cash to our shareholders in the 

 

form of increased dividends and share repurchases our focus on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders has positioned us for another successful year in 2016 

looking ahead to the 2016 first quarter we expect seasonally lower volumes in our north american industrial packaging business with some offset from higher export volume which carries a lower margin additionally we expect seasonally lower volumes in our brazilian printing papers business as the fourth quarter historically represents the strongest volume quarter for this business pricing is expected to be lower for our north american printing papers and pulp business primarily driven by lower pulp prices additionally pricing is expected to be lower in our north american industrial packaging business due to lower export pricing and price index changes we expect price improvements in our emea printing papers business including russia and brazilian printing papers business following announced price increases although these will be largely offset by inflationary cost pressures we expect operating performance to be in line with the 2015 fourth quarter with some modest improvement in our north american industrial packaging business planned maintenance downtime costs should increase primarily driven by outages in our north american industrial packaging and printing papers businesses including costs associated with the riegelwood mill conversion equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to benefit from strong operations offset by softwood pulp price pressure and normal seasonality additionally we expect ilim’s earnings to be impacted by the absence of the positive impact from foreign currency movements driven by ilim’s us dollar denominated debt as we assume no change in foreign currency rates in our outlook 

for the 2016 full year we continue to face an uncertain macroeconomic environment but believe we are well positioned to deal with whatever the market brings we will continue to improve our north american industrial packaging business by further realizing optimization opportunities during 2016 we expect to complete the riegelwood mill conversion during first half of 2016 and be fully ramped by the 2016 fourth quarter initially producing softwood market pulp additionally we will continue executing against our plan to drive profitable growth following the recent expansion within the foodservice business as well as optimizing commercial opportunities and mix within the north american printing papers portfolio finally we will remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2016   

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2016  through current cash balances and cash from operations additionally the company has existing credit facilities totaling 21 billion available at december 31 2015 

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2015  the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a total debttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities the total debttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2015  international paper’s net worth was 141 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 398 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2015  the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa2 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2015  were as follows   



 we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2015  the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 600 million we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2015  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 35 billion  higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 32 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits 

 

the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling 750 million  and 353 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively at this time we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2016  although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates international paper has announced a voluntary limitedtime opportunity for former employees who are participants in the retirement plan of international paper company the pension plan to request early payment of their entire pension plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment eligible participants who wish to receive the lump sum payment must make an election between february 29 and april 29 2016 and payment is scheduled to be made on or before june 30 2016 all payments will be made from the pension plan trust assets the target population has a total liability of 30 billion the amount of the total payments will depend on the participation rate of eligible participants but is expected to be approximately 15 billion based on the expected level of payments settlement accounting rules will apply in the period in which the payments are made this will result in a plan remeasurement and the recognition in earnings of a prorata portion of unamortized net actuarial loss 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement was amended on may 7 2014 pursuant to the amended agreement beginning on january 1 2017 either the company or its partners may commence certain procedures specified under the deadlock provisions if these or any other deadlock provisions are commenced the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners’ 50  interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these 

 

key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its brazil packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business totaling 137 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the brazil packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash 

flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall brazilian economy 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its asia industrial packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business totaling 100 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the asia industrial packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its india papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business totaling 112 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the india papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the india papers operations 

also in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business totaling 400 million  the decline in fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations 

as a result during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of 512 million  485 million after taxes and a gain of 3 million related to noncontrolling interest representing all of the recorded goodwill of the xpedx business and the india papers business 

also during 2013 the company recorded a pretax charge of 15 million 7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our india papers business 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2015  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2015 was 775 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2016  pension expense by 

approximately 27 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 36 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1  increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 75  and 70  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2005 – 2015 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 374 million  and 41 million  respectively 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the increase in 2015  us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate updated mortality assumptions higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a settlement charge in 2015 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2015  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows   



 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 364 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2016  with the decrease from expense of 461 million  in 2015  reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate to 440 in 2016 from 410 in 2015 updated demographic assumptions and lower unrecognized losses 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2015  totaled approximately 109 billion  consisting of approximately 48  equity securities 33  debt securities 10  real estate and 9  other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company 

and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future there are no required contributions to the us qualified plan in 2016 the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 62 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  

accounting for stockbased compensation 

the company has a performance share plan which grants performancebased restricted stock units that are paid out in stock when the awards are earned such incentive compensation plans are accounted for under asc 718 “compensation  stock compensation” this standard requires that the value of shares to be issued under this plan be recognized as compensation over the period in which the awards are earned based on the fair value of the awards and requires the use of a number of judgments and assumptions in determining the timing and amount of such charges additionally since a component of these awards is based on the company’s performance over a specified period compared to other companies the amount of expense recorded for a given period could require adjustments after the end of the period 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution 

 

of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 37  14  and 41  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2015  was 33  of pretax earnings compared with 31  in 2014  and 26  in 2013  we estimate that the 2016  effective income tax rate will be approximately 34 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

recent accounting developments 

there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 2 recent accounting developments  on pages 51 and 52 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

legal proceedings 

information concerning the company’s environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 11 commitments and contingencies  on pages 61 through 64 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement 

impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit  on pages 66 and 67 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 67 through 71 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2015  and 2014  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2015  and 2014  the net fair 

 

value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 93 billion  and 98 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 565 million  and 410 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2015  and 2014  was approximately a 7 million  and a 2 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 1 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2015  and 2014  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 4 million  and a 1 million  asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 30 million  and 52 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent   93 million   in   2014   for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately   134 million   in   2015   for similar capital projects including expenditures associated with the us environmental protection agencys epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology 

 

regulations capital expenditures for 2016 environmental capital projects are anticipated to be approximately   96 million including boiler mact costs capital expenditures for 2017 environmental capital projects are estimated to be   115 million including boiler mact costs on january 31 2013 the epa issued the final suite of boiler mact regulations these regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the boiler mact regulations and on december 1 2014 epa proposed limited revisions to the regulations litigation challenging these regulations is ongoing as such the projected capital expenditures for environmental capital projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the boiler mact regulations are subject to change 

in the us revisions to national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so 2  nitrogen dioxide no 2  and fine particulate pm 25  finalized between 2010 and 2012 and a proposed revision to the naaqs for ozone in late 2014 have not had a material impact on the company regulations addressing specific implementation issues related to the so 2 naaqs are being developed by the epa and are expected to be finalized during the next two years potentially material capital investment may be required in response to these emerging requirements 

climate change 

climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature precipitation or winds that persist for decades or longer climate change can be caused by natural factors such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere such as from the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts may have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

the 1997 kyoto protocol established emission reduction obligations for certain countries where the company had and continues to have operations though the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 several countries and most notably the european union eu extended their emissions commitments until 2020 a successor program to the kyoto protocol is the subject of ongoing international negotiations including a 

conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol scheduled for december 2015 it is not yet clear if these negotiations will result in a new international climate change agreement and if so what form it may take due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how allocation of and market prices for greenhouse gas ghg credits evolve over the coming years 

national efforts 

in the us the kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation the us epa has enacted i regulations to control ghgs from mobile sources through transportation fuel efficiency standards ii new source performance standards nsps for new electrical generating units egus and iii regulations requiring reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year in 2014 the company reported to epa the ghg emissions from 23 of our us manufacturing sites and 8 landfills 

in 2010 epa issued ghg regulations for new and modified sources under the new source review and title v operating permit programs and shortly thereafter deferred the applicability of these ghgs regulations to biomass carbon emissions until the summer of 2014 epa subsequently issued guidance clarifying that ghgs cannot be the sole basis for designating a new or modified source as a major source subject to new source review or title v air permitting requirements epa also established that bact best available control technology would be required for any ghg emissions increase above 75000 tons per year if a new source or title v review was required for other regulated pollutants 

on november 19 2014 epa issued a revised draft carbon accounting framework addressing the circumstances under which biomass combustion can be considered carbon neutral epa has stated it intends to issue future rulemakings to address how states may use the revised framework in implementing state permit rules and in developing plans for regulating ghgs from utility electric generators given the uncertainties regarding the framework and scope of future ghg 

 

rulemaking it is unclear what impacts if any epa’s actions in this area will have on the company’s operations 

in 2013 epa issued final regulations establishing new source performance standards nsps for new electrical generating units egus this regulation is the first of several expected nspss that epa will implement over the coming years the epa has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources will be subject to new ghg nsps rules it is unclear what impacts if any future ghg nsps rules will have on the company’s operations 

in 2014 epa proposed regulations for ghgs from new and existing utility electric generators these regulations have the potential to increase purchased electricity prices across the united states the proposed rules phase in the compliance obligations between about 2018 and 2030 and they remain subject to substantive revisions before final promulgation epa estimates purchased electricity prices will increase by less than seven percent but some utilities are estimating significantly higher price increases given the uncertainties regarding the scope of the final regulations it is unclear what impacts if any these regulations will have on the company’s operations 

state regional and local measures 

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of ghgs by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs one such state is california the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any statelevel ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

summary 

regulation of ghgs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding ghgs and climate change at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing 

delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper is available in our sustainability report found at httpwwwinternationalpapercomus encompanysustainabilitysustainabilityreporthtml  though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail below in “item 1a risk factors” we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

all financial information and statistical measures regarding our 5050 ilim joint venture in russia “ilim” other than historical international paper equity earnings and dividends received by international paper have been prepared by the management of ilim in providing this information in this filing we are relying on the effectiveness of ilims internal control environment any projected financial information and statistical measures reflect the current views of ilim management and are subject to the risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such projections 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source increased demand for biomass to meet a growing number of government mandates and incentives to promote the use of biomass for renewable electrical energy generation may also impact pricing and availability of virgin wood fiber in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 

our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such 

 

raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2014  international paper had approximately 94 billion of outstanding indebtedness including 87 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes there was no indebtedness outstanding under our 

credit facilities as of december 31 2014 the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our 

 

dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 33 billion of our debt as of december 31 2014  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating as a result a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

our inability to extend renew or refinance loan agreements used to monetize installment notes from the sale of our forestlands may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes   in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands we received installment notes or timber notes which we contributed to certain borrower entities the entities to which these installment notes were contributed used the installment notes as collateral for approximately 48 billion in loans from thirdparty lenders of the 48 billion in loans from thirdparty lenders 41 billion mature in september 2015 while the installment notes mature in august 2016 unless extended failure to extend renew or refinance these loans prior to their stated maturity could trigger the sale of the installment notes to facilitate the 41 billion debt payment which in turn would result in an acceleration of the payment of approximately 12 billion in deferred income taxes in 2015 rather than in 2016 when the installment notes mature unless extended the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements for further information see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources  and note 10 income taxes  on pages 62 through 64 and note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries  on pages 67 through 69 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes  we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to the company in connection with our 2006 

and templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2006 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to 23 billion in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the companys consolidated financial statements see note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries  on pages 67 through 69 and note 10 income taxes  on pages 62 through 64 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information  

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs   health care reform under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 could also increase costs with respect to medical coverage of the company’s fulltime employees significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2014  was 39 billion the amount and timing of future 

 

contributions will depend upon a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically russia brazil poland china india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar such as in russia during 2014 downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety labor and employment and health care there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by 

restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances as another example we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 



 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

operating earnings a nongaap measure is defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense international paper generated operating earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of 300  in 2014  compared with 306  in 2013  and 251  in 2012  diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 129  in 2014  compared with 311  in 2013  and 180  in 2012  

international paper delivered strong results during 2014 driven by margin expansion in all our key businesses most notably in our north american industrial packaging business we generated record cash flow from operations which enabled the company to return cash to our shareholders in the form of approximately 1 billion in share buybacks and a 14 increase in the quarterly dividend beginning with the 2014 fourth quarter dividend payment finally with respect to our balanced use of cash we completed a bond issue and related tender offer which enabled us to address outstanding debt due in 2018 and 2019 as well as shift from higher cost to lower cost debt 

our 2014 results reflect continued margin expansion driven by sustained price improvements in our north american industrial packaging business along with improved pricing in our north american printing papers and consumer packaging businesses in aggregate volumes were down largely due to declines in our north american printing papers business following the completion of the courtland mill closure input costs increased year over year largely due to higher wood costs and higher energy costs which were impacted by the significant adverse weather events experienced in much of the us during the 2014 first quarter our ilim joint venture delivered continued solid operational performance in 2014 associated with the productivity rampup of the two joint venture funded capital projects and other efficiency improvements ilim’s 2014 results were significantly impacted by unfavorable noncash foreign currency movements associated with ilim’s us dollar denominated debt particularly in the 2014 fourth quarter finally during 2014 we completed the spinoff of the xpedx distribution business which included our receipt of 411 million in special payments 

overall 2014 reflects our successful efforts to drive margin growth across all of our key businesses we once again generated returns in excess of our cost of capital while returning cash to our shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share repurchases we exited 

 

2014 with significant momentum entering 2015 with a particular focus on execution to drive continued earnings growth and strong free cash flow 

looking ahead to the 2015 first quarter we expect volume to be largely flat with the exception of seasonally lower volumes in our brazilian and european printing papers businesses the fourth quarter historically represents the strongest volume quarter for our brazilian printing papers business pricing is expected to be relatively stable except for our european printing papers and european industrial packaging businesses where pricing pressure continues due to the challenging economic conditions we expect improved operating performance as we move past the isolated issues that impacted the 2014 fourth quarter in our north american industrial packaging and brazil printing papers businesses input costs should be relatively stable in the 2015 first quarter with some improvement in the north american industrial packaging business primarily related to lower energy and fuel costs planned maintenance downtime costs should increase primarily driven by outages in our north american industrial packaging business equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to benefit from the absence of the significant negative impact from remeasurement of ilim’s us dollar denominated debt due to devaluation of the russian ruble in the 2014 fourth quarter 

for the 2015 full year we anticipate an overall challenging macroeconomic environment but expect to benefit from the strengthening us economy even in those markets facing economic headwinds namely brazil and russia our low cost export position should enable us to effectively navigate these challenges there continues to be significant optimization opportunities in our north american industrial packaging business which we expect to further realize during 2015 additionally we expect improvement in the results of our brazilian industrial packaging business along with the benefits of continued margin expansion at the ilim joint venture we also expect to take further advantage of the growing demand for fiberbased food packaging in addition we expect to realize the benefits of the repositioned north american printing papers business following the completion of the courtland mill closure finally we expect to generate strong free cash flow results but we do expect some impact from higher cash taxes driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings and other nonrepeating events that benefitted 2014 cash taxes 

free cash flow a nongaap measure of 21 billion  generated in 2014  was higher than the 18 billion  generated in 2013  and the 16 billion  generated in 2012  see reconciliation on page 32 

operating earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of 053  in the 2014 fourth quarter were lower than the 095  in the 2014 third quarter and the 081  in the 2013 fourth quarter diluted earnings loss 

per share attributable to common shareholders were 032  in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with 083  in the 2014 third quarter and 098  in the 2013 fourth quarter 

free cash flow of 739 million  generated in the 2014  fourth quarter was higher than the 696 million  generated in the 2014  third quarter and the 598 million  generated in the 2013  fourth quarter see reconciliation on page 32 

operating earnings and operating earnings per share are nongaap measures diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure the company calculates operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap nonoperating pension expense and discontinued operations management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most directly comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations the following are reconciliations of operating earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders to diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the 

pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

cash uses during 2014  were primarily focused on working capital requirements capital spending debt reductions and returning cash to shareholders 

cash provided by operating activities

offbalance sheet variable interest entities 

information concerning offbalance sheet variable interest entities is set forth in note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries  on pages 67 through 69 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for discussion  

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2015   

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2015  through current cash balances and cash from operations additionally the company has existing credit facilities totaling 20 billion of which nothing has been used 

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2014  the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a total debttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities the total debttocapital ratio is 

 

defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2014  international paper’s net worth was 140 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 40 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2014  the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa2 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2014  were as follows   



 

as discussed in note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries  on pages 67 through 69 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands we received 48 billion of installment notes or timber notes which we contributed to certain nonconsolidated borrower entities the installment notes mature in august 2016 unless extended the deferred 

tax liability of 14 billion related to the 2006 forestlands sale will be settled in connection with the maturity of the timber notes the entities to which these installment notes were contributed used the installment notes as collateral for 48 billion of borrowings from thirdparty lenders of these thirdparty loans 41 billion mature in september 2015 failure to extend renew or refinance these thirdparty loans prior to their stated maturity which we believe is unlikely could trigger the sale of the installment notes to facilitate the 41 billion debt payment which in turn would result in an acceleration of the payment of the deferred income taxes that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sale as a result we could have tax payment obligations of approximately 12 billion in 2015 we expect we would fund these tax payments if required from current cash balances cash from operations borrowings under our existing credit facilities accessing capital markets or a combination thereof 

we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2014  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2014  the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 1 billion we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2014  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 38 billion  higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 34 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefitsthe projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling 353 million  and 31 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively at this time we expect that required contributions to its plans in 2015  will be approximately 63 million although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing 

 

and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement was amended on may 7 2014 pursuant to the amended agreement beginning on january 1 2017 either the company or its partners may commence certain procedures specified under the deadlock provisions if these or any other deadlock provisions are commenced the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners’ 50  interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for 

environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for 

 

each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its asia industrial packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in this business totaling 100 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the asia industrial packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the business 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its india papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business totaling 112 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the india papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the india papers operations 

also in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business totaling 400 million  the decline in fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations as a result during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of 512 million  485 million after taxes and a gain of 3 million related to noncontrolling interest representing all of the recorded goodwill of the xpedx business and the india papers business 

also during 2013 the company recorded a pretax charge of 15 million 7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our india papers business 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2012 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2014  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is 

 

based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31 2014 was 775 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2015  pension expense by approximately 25 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 36 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1  increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns international paper and templeinland assets were combined in october 2014 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 103  and 81  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2004 – 2014 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to 

changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 475 million  and 43 million  respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the decrease in 2014  us pension expense principally reflects an increase in the discount rate and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses the increase in 2014 us postretirement expense is principally due to lower amortization of prior service credits 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2014  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows   



 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 488 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2015  with the increase from expense of 387 million  in 2014  reflecting a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 410 in 2015 from 465 in 2014 updated mortality assumptions and higher unrecognized losses 

 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2014  totaled approximately 109 billion  consisting of approximately 47  equity securities 33  debt securities 10  real estate and 10  other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future the required contribution for the us qualified pension plans in 2015 is approximately 63 million the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 38 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  

accounting for stock options 

international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2014  and 2013  007 million options and 18 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices of 3903 per share for 2014  and a range of 3841 to 4819 per share for 2013  

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 14  41  and 32  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2014  was 31  of pretax earnings compared with 26  in 2013  and 28  in 2012  we estimate that the 2015  effective income tax rate will be approximately 33 based on expected earnings and business conditions

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with nonfunctional currency financial assets and liabilities indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit  on pages 69 and 70 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 70 through 74 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2014  and 2013  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2014  and 2013  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 98 billion  and 101 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 410 million  and 480 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2014  and 2013  was approximately a 2 million  liability and a 2 million  asset respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 1 million  and 2 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2014  and 2013  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 1 million  and a 4 million  asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 52 million  and 88 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively

research and development 

the company operates its primary research and development center in loveland ohio as well as several product laboratories additionally the company has an interest in arborgen inc a joint venture with certain other forest products companies 

we direct research and development activities to shortterm longterm and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions and to process equipment and product innovations activities include product development within the operating divisions studies on innovation and improvement of pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking converting and coating processes packaging design and materials development mechanical packaging systems environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges reuse of raw materials in manufacturing processes recycling of consumer and packaging paper products energy conservation applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations innovations and improvement of products and development of various new products our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste the cost to the company of its research and development operations was 18 million  in 2013  13 million  in 2012  and 13 million  in 2011

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations the company spent 61 million  in 2013  for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 140 million  in 2014  for similar capital projects including expenditures associated with the us environmental protection agencys epa boiler mact maximum achievable control technology 

 

regulations capital expenditures for 2015 environmental capital projects are anticipated to be approximately 160 million  including boiler mact costs capital expenditures for 2016 environmental capital projects are estimated to be 110 million  including boiler mact costs on january 31 2013 the epa issued the final boiler mact suite of regulations these regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the boiler mact regulations as such the projected capital expenditures for environmental capital projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the boiler mact regulations are subject to change 

in the us air quality regulations finalized by the epa during 2013 are not expected to have a material impact on the company to date revisions to national ambient air quality standards naaqs for sulfur dioxide so 2  nitrogen dioxide no2 and fine particulate pm25 finalized between 2010 and 2012 have not had a material impact on the company regulations addressing specific implementation issues related to the so2 naaqs are being developed by the epa and are expected to be finalized during the next two years potentially material capital investment might be required in response to these emerging requirements 

climate change 

climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature precipitation or winds that persist for decades or longer climate change can be caused by natural factors such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere such as from the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities various international national and subnational regional state and local governmental actions have been undertaken presently these efforts have not materially impacted international paper but such efforts might have a material impact on the company in the future 

international efforts 

in 1997 the kyoto protocol established emission reduction obligations for certain countries where the company had and continues to have operations though the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 several countries and most notably the european union eu extended their emissions commitments until 2020 a successor program to the kyoto protocol is the subject of ongoing international negotiations it is not yet clear if these negotiations will result in a new international 

climate change agreement and if so what form it will take due to this uncertainty it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on the company 

to assist member countries in meeting obligations under the kyoto protocol the eu established and continues to operate an emissions trading system eu ets currently we have two sites directly subject to regulation under phase iii of the eu ets one in poland and one in france other sites that we operate in the eu experience indirect impacts of the eu ets through purchased power pricing neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the eu ets have been material to the company but they could be material to the company in the future depending on how allocation of and market prices for greenhouse gas ghg credits evolve over the coming years 

national efforts 

in the us the kyoto protocol was not ratified and congress has not passed ghg legislation the us epa has acted regulatorily to control ghgs from mobile sources through transportation fuel efficiency standards and requires reporting of ghgs from sources of ghgs greater than 25000 tons per year in 2013 the company reported to epa the ghg emissions from 23 of our us manufacturing sites and 7 landfills in 2010 epa issued ghg regulations for new and modified sources under the new source review and title v operating permit programs however epa deferred the applicability of these ghgs regulations to biomass emissions until the summer of 2014 to allow a science advisory board sab to provide input to epa on how to incorporate the concept of carbon neutrality for biomass into their regulatory processes before epa could act on the sab report the us court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the epa could not administratively defer regulation of biomass ghg emissions the mandate for the biomass deferral vacature has yet to be acted upon and thus it is unclear how epa will incorporate the decision into climate change regulations 

epa has also issued final regulations establishing new source performance standards nsps for new electrical generating units egus this regulation is the first of several expected nspss that epa will implement over the coming years currently the epa has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources will be subject to new ghg nsps rules it is unclear what impacts if any future ghg nsps rules will have on the company’s operations 

 

state regional and local measures 

a few us states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional ghg capandtrade programs one such state is california the company does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states it is unclear what impacts if any state level ghg rules will have on the company’s operations 

summary 

regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding greenhouse gases and climate change at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate we regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper including our emissions for 2013 are available in our sustainability report found at httpwwwinternationalpapercomusencompanysustainabilitysustainabilityreporthtml though this information is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

all financial information and statistical measures regarding our 5050 ilim joint venture in russia “ilim” other than historical international paper equity earnings and dividends received by international paper have been prepared by the management of ilim ilim management has indicated that the financial information was prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards and extracted from ilim’s financial statements but international paper has not verified or audited any of this information any projected financial information and statistical measures reflect the current views of ilim management and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such projections 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source increased demand 

for biomass to meet a growing number of government mandates and incentives to promote the use of biomass for renewable electrical energy generation may also impact pricing and availability of virgin wood fiber in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 

our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our 

 

products in addition volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial con 

dition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2013  international paper had approximately 95 billion of outstanding indebtedness including 0 of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and 88 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating 

organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 43 billion of our debt as of december 31 2013  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating as a result a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes  we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to the company in connection with our 2006 and templeinlands 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2006 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained see note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries  on pages 72 through 75 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information  

 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets and health care reform could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2013  was 22 billion this includes liability for the international paper company pension plans as well as the templeinland retirement plan for which we have responsibility in connection with the templeinland acquisition the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland china india and turkey where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including 

governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations   our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and other government requirements  including among others those relating to the environment health and safety and to labor and employment there can be no assurance that laws regulations and government requirements will not be changed applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs for example we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of 

 

hazardous substances as another example we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 



 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology that manages operations and other business processes  international paper business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company employee customer or vendor information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit  several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint 

 

venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

the agreedupon transaction combining xpedx with unisource may not be completed within the expected timeframe or at all and we may not achieve the expected benefits from this divestiture or from other strategic acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures on january 28 2014 we announced that xpedx holding company spinco and unisource will merge under the terms of a definitive agreement that will result in the creation of a new publicly traded company the transaction will be accomplished through a reverse morris trust structure in which international paper will indirectly contribute the assets of xpedx to a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary spinco in exchange for shares of common stock of spinco a special payment of 400 million subject to adjustments expected to be financed with new debt in spincos capital structure as well as the potential for an additional cash payment pursuant to an earnout provision international paper will distribute shares of spinco to international paper shareholders on a pro rata basis in a manner intended to be taxfree to international paper and its shareholders the transaction is expected to be completed in mid2014 completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of important conditions that are beyond our control and may prevent delay or otherwise negatively affect its completion 

the success of the transaction will depend in part on the ability of the combined company to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies spincos success in realizing these growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of xpedx’s business and operations with unisource’s business and operations even if the combined company is able to integrate the xpedx and unisource businesses and operations successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies currently expected from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover substantial expenses will be incurred in connection with the transaction and with the integration of xpedx’s business 

with unisource’s business such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the transaction may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses 

more broadly our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent strategic acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as recently completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers placing higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper 

if the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree spinoff under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of international paper or spinco then international paper andor the international paper shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

the spinoff and the merger are conditioned upon international paper’s receipt of a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service “irs” to the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify as taxfree to international paper and the international paper shareholders for us federal income tax purposes although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs the irs ruling does not rule that the spinoff satisfies every requirement for a taxfree spinoff under section 355 of the code and the parties will rely solely on the opinion of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements are satisfied 

if the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree spinoff under section 355 of the code then the receipt of spinco common stock would be taxable to the international paper shareholders international paper might recognize a substantial gain on the spinoff and spinco may be required to indemnify international paper for the tax on such gain pursuant to a tax matters agreement there can be no assurance that spinco would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify international paper for any such taxable gain 

 

in addition the spinoff will be taxable to international paper pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or more change in ownership of either international paper or spinco directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff because the international paper shareholders will collectively own more than 50 of our common stock following the merger the merger alone will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to international paper under section 355e of the code however section 355e of the code might apply if other acquisitions of stock of international paper before or after the merger or of spinco after the merger are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

operating earnings a nongaap measure is defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense international paper generated operating earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of 316  in 2013  compared with 265  in 2012  and 312  in 2011  diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 311  in 2013  compared with 180  in 2012  and 303  in 2011  

international paper delivered strong results during 2013 driven by margin expansion across many of our businesses yearoveryear revenues grew despite a challenging economic environment we generated record cash flow from operations of 3 billion strong free cash flow enabled the company to return cash to our shareholders in the form of a share buyback program instituted during the 2013 third quarter and a 17 increase in the quarterly dividend beginning with the 2013 fourth quarter dividend payment 

our 2013 results reflect the significant progress we made on the pricing front particularly in our north american industrial packaging business along with solid manufacturing operations yearoveryear sales volumes were down but we managed to offset some of this decline as the year progressed mainly through our north american industrial packaging business input costs were a headwind in 2013 as expected largely driven by increased fiber costs in the second half of the year we made decisions during 2013 to rationalize capacity in our consumer packaging and north american printing papers businesses through the shutdown of a paper machine at our augusta facility and initiating the closure of our courtland mill respectively also during the year we finalized acquisitions in turkey and brazil and completed the sale of the templeinland building products business there was steady progress in the rampups of the two capital projects at our ilim joint venture in russia but the operational benefits were offset by higher costs of the startups and unfavorable foreign currency movements driven by ilim’s us dollar denominated debt finally we made significant progress during 2013 towards the spinoff of the xpedx distribution business to our shareholders culminating in the signing of a definitive merger agreement in january 2014 

overall 2013 reflects our successful efforts to drive margin growth through greater price realizations coupled with solid operational performance we generated returns in excess of our cost of capital while further strengthening our balance sheet through debt pay downs and favorable 

 

movements in our net pension liability we exited 2013 with significant momentum with the expectation that we will continue to generate a stronger performance in the business in 2014 

looking ahead to the 2014 first quarter seasonally lower sales volumes in the brazilian and european printing papers businesses combined with the impact from the full shutdown at courtland and the coated paperboard project at our kwidzyn will more than offset the volume benefits from two additional shipping days in our north american industrial packaging business additionally the severe weather events impacting much of the us in early 2014 will further negatively impact volumes the full implementation of the cutsize price increase in the 2013 fourth quarter will improve pricing for our north american printing papers business sales margins in the north american and brazilian industrial packaging businesses are expected to reflect more favorable mix and pricing the negative impact from input costs in the 2014 first quarter will be significant due in large part to the extreme temperatures affecting much of the us both in terms of unit cost pressure and higher consumption planned maintenance downtime costs should increase in north america as we pull more outages into the 2014 first quarter while costs in our european printing papers business should be lower equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to be relatively flat with 2013 fourth quarter results absent any negative impact from foreign currency movements driven by ilim’s us dollar denominated debt 

for the 2014 full year we do not anticipate macroeconomic conditions significantly better than those experienced during 2013 even in light of this we expect a meaningful increase in yearoveryear earnings there are significant optimization opportunities in our north american industrial packaging business which we expect to further realize during 2014 additionally the ilim project and cost synergy projects at orsa will provide opportunities to increase earnings during 2014 we expect input cost inflation similar to that experienced during 2013 the 2014 tax rate should return to a more normal level due to the nonrepeat of benefits recognized in 2013 finally free cash flow generation should continue to grow which will enable us to continue a balanced approach to cash allocation and to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders 

free cash flow a nongaap measure of 18 billion  generated in 2013  was higher than the 16 billion  generated in 2012  and the 17 billion  generated in 2011  see reconciliation on page 35 

operating earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of 083  in the fourth quarter of 2013 were lower than the 105  in the 2013 third quarter and higher than the 069  in the 2012 fourth quarter diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders 

were 098  in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with 085  in the third quarter of 2013 and 053  in the fourth quarter of 2012 

free cash flow of 595 million  generated in the 2013  fourth quarter was higher than the 454 million  generated in the 2013  third quarter and the 384 million  generated in the 2012  fourth quarter see reconciliation on page 35 

operating earnings is a nongaap measure diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders is the most direct comparable gaap measure the company calculates operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap nonoperating pension expense and discontinue operations management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations the following are reconciliations of operating earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders to diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders

corporate special items including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of 32 million  in 2013  compared with a loss of 49 million in 2012  and a loss of 76 million  in 2011  

interest expense net was 612 million  in 2013  compared with 672 million  in 2012  and 541 million  in 2011  the decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 reflects lower average debt levels and the reversal of interest reserves related to us federal income tax audits the increase in 2012 compared with 2011 is due to interest expense associated with the templeinland acquisitions 

a net income tax benefit of 523 million  was recorded for 2013  including a tax benefit of 770 million associated with the settlement of tax audits and a net tax benefit of 4 million for other items the 2012  income tax provision of 331 million  includes a net expense of 14 million related to internal restructurings and an expense of 5 million to adjust deferred tax assets related to postretirement prescription drug coverage medicare part d reimbursements the 2011  income tax provision of 311 million  includes a tax benefit of 222 million related to the reduction of the carrying value of the shorewood business and the writeoff of a deferred tax liability associated with shorewood a 24 million expense related to internal restructurings a 9 million expense for costs associated with our acquisition of a majority interest in andhra pradesh paper mills limited a 13 million benefit related to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a 2 million expense for other items

sales volumes decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting flat demand for boxes and the impact of commercial decisions average sales price realizations were significantly higher mainly due to the realization of price increases for domestic containerboard and boxes input costs were higher for wood energy and recycled fiber freight costs also increased planned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2012 manufacturing operating costs decreased but were offset by inflation and higher overhead and distribution costs the business took about 850000 tons of total downtime in 2013 of which about 450000 were marketrelated and 400000 were maintenance downtime in 2012 the business took about 945000 tons of total downtime of which about 580000 were marketrelated and about 365000 were maintenance downtime operating profits in 2013 included 62 million of costs associated with the integration of templeinland operating profits in 2012 included 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of templeinland and 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills

sales volumes in 2013 were higher than in 2012 reflecting strong demand for packaging in the agricultural markets in morocco and turkey in europe sales volumes decreased slightly due to continuing weak demand for packaging in the industrial markets and lower demand for packaging in the agricultural markets resulting from poor weather conditions average sales margins were significantly lower due to input costs for containerboard rising ahead of box sales price increases other input costs were also higher primarily for energy operating profits in 2013 and 2012 included net gains of 13 million and 10 million respectively for insurance settlements and italian government grants partially offset by additional operating costs related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may 2012 which affected our san felice box plant

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

cash uses during 2013  were primarily focused on working capital requirements capital spending strategic acquisitions debt reductions and returning cash to shareholders 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 30 billion  in 2013  compared with 30 billion  for 2012  and 27 billion  for 2011  

the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items increased by 608 million  in 2013  versus 2012  driven mainly by the release of tax reserves partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets cash used for working capital components accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 486 million  in 2013  compared with cash provided of 84 million  in 2012  and a cash use of 505 million  in 2011  

the company generated free cash flow of approximately 18 billion  16 billion  and 17 billion  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most comparable gaap 

measure is cash provided by operations management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets make investments or acquisitions pay dividends and reduce debt the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2013  the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a total debttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities the total debttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2013  international paper’s net worth was 151 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 39 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2013  the company held 

 

longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa3 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2013  were as follows   



 we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2013  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2013  the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 900 million we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2013  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 22 billion  higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 18 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefitsthe projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding 

contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling 31 million  and 44 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively at this time we expect that required contributions to its plans in 2014  will be approximately 443 million although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions in prior years had certain procedures been commenced under the deadlock provisions the company would have been required to purchase its partners’ 50  interest in ilim but those provisions have expired if deadlock procedures are commenced today although it is not obligated to do so the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement international paper estimates that the current purchase price for its partners’ 50  interests would not be material and could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the company’s option any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement although they have the right to do so 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds 

the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments the company calculated the estimated fair value of its india papers business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill of this business totaling 112 million  should be written off the decline in the fair value of the india papers reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the strategic outlook for the india papers operations 

also in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company calculated the estimated fair value of its xpedx business using the discounted future cash flows and wrote off all of the goodwill of its xpedx business totaling 400 million  the decline in fair value of the xpedx reporting unit and resulting impairment charge was due to a significant decline in earnings and a change in the strategic outlook for the xpedx operations 

 

as a result during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of 512 million  485 million after taxes and a gain of 3 million related to noncontrolling interest representing all of the recorded goodwill of the xpedx business and the india papers business 

also during 2013 the company recorded a pretax charge of 15 million 7 million after taxes and noncontrolling interest for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset related to our india papers business 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2012  or 2011  

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2013  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows   



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension obligations for the years shown 



additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2014  pension expense by approximately 25 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 35 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1  increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were   



the 2012 and 2013 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and templeinland asset returns the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 137  and 88  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2003 – 2013 

 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 316 million  and 30 million  respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows   



the increase in 2013  us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate and higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses the increase in 2013 us postretirement expense is principally due to a curtailment gain in 2012 related to the remeasurement of the templeinland plan 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2013  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

  



 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 366 million  for its us 

defined benefit plans in 2014  with the decrease from expense of 545 million  in 2013  reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate to 490 in 2014 from 410 in 2013 lower unrecognized losses a higher expected return on assets assumption of 700 for templeinland plan assets offset by a lower return on assets assumption of 775 for international paper plan assets 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2013  totaled approximately 107 billion  consisting of approximately 49  equity securities 32  debt securities 10  real estate and 9  other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future the required contribution for the us qualified pension plans in 2014 is approximately 443 million the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 28 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  

accounting for stock options 

international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2013  and 2012  18 million  options and 91 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 3841 to 4819 per share for 2013  and 3374 to 4126 per share for 2012  

 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 62  32  and 21  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2013  was 27  of pretax earnings compared with 29  in 2012  and 32  in 2011  we estimate that the 2014  effective income tax rate will be approximately 33 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

recent accounting developments

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a weaker us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit  on pages 75 and 76 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  on pages 76 through 80 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2013  and 2012  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2013  and 2012  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 101 billion  and 118 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 480 million  and 642 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2013  and 2012  was approximately a 2 million  asset and a 1 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 2 million  and 1 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned 

and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2013  and 2012  the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 4 million  asset and a 13 million  liability respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 88 million  and 49 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

  



 

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2013  management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on pages 45 and 46 management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013  

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework 1992” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit and finance committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 of this annual report under the heading “financial statements and supplementary data” deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of four independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

the company completed the acquisitions of olmuksan and orsa ip both in january 2013 due to the timing of these acquisitions we have excluded olmuksan and orsa ip from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the period ended december 31 2013  net sales and assets of both olmuksan and orsa ip represented approximately 2 of total net sales and 2 of total assets

research and development 

the company operates its primary research and development center in loveland ohio as well as several product laboratories additionally the company has an interest in arborgen inc a joint venture with certain other forest products companies 

we direct research and development activities to shortterm longterm and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions and to process equipment and product innovations activities include product development within the operating divisions studies on innovation and improvement of pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking converting and coating processes packaging design and materials development mechanical packaging systems environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges reuse of raw materials in manufacturing processes recycling of consumer and packaging paper products energy conservation applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations innovations and improvement of products and development of various new products our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste the cost to the company of its research and development operations was 13 million  in 2012  13 million  in 2011  and 12 million  in 2010

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 60 million  was spent in 2012  for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 90 million  in 2013  for similar capital projects including expenditures associated with the environmental protection agencys epa boiler 

 

mact maximum achievable control technology rule projected capital expenditures for 2014 environmental capital projects are anticipated to be approximately 285 million  much of which is associated with the new boiler mact rule preliminary cost projections for 2015 environmental capital projects are estimated to be 300 million  much of which is again associated with boiler mact in march 2011 the epa published four interrelated final rules commonly and collectively referred to as “boiler mact” as finalized these rules required owners of specified boilers to meet very strict air emissions standards for certain substances the rule was immediately subject to administrative reconsideration by the epa and several lawsuits on december 20 2012 the epa issued its final reconsidered boiler mact suite of rules international paper is actively analyzing the rules to determine among other things its costs and this process is in its early stages as such the projected capital expenditures for environmental capital projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the boiler mact analysis is in the early stages and subject to change 

in the us the epa proposed or finalized a number of new rules including greenhouse gas mandatory reporting see climate change section and more restrictive national ambient air quality standards naaqss the epa has promulgated new naaqss for nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide so 2  and we anticipate that additional naaqss will also be forthcoming additionally the epa published phase i of its pulp and paper national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants neshap to date these regulations have not had a material impact on international paper operations however once fully implemented these rules could require significant investments of capital andor operational changes that could potentially have a material impact 

climate change 

in 1997 an international conference on global warming concluded with an agreement known as the kyoto protocol the kyoto protocol called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations while the us and many other countries did not ratify the kyoto protocol it has formed the basis for a range of international national and subnational proposals and regulations focusing on greenhouse gas reduction some of these regulations apply currently or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

although the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 a successor protocol is currently under negotiation at the international level several countries or geographic areas in which we operate such as the eu india brazil 

china and morocco have signaled they intend to continue to participate in an extended kyoto process while only the eu had actual emissions caps some countries are enacting local programs to address climate change currently these local programs do not appear to materially impact ip operations russia and the us have not agreed to participate in the postkyoto process due to the lack of clarity around what postkyoto will look like it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on international papers operations under the european union emissions trading system euets the eu has committed to greenhouse gas reductions international paper has two sites covered by the euets these measures did not have a material effect on our european operations in 2012 nor are they expected to have such an impact in 2013 at current market prices for emission credits significant swings in market price associated with credits could impact european operations 

the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol nor have efforts in the us congress to legislate the control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions been successful to date the activity in the us has been spearheaded by the us epa and to some extent by the states pursuant to the ghg mandatory reporting rule promulgated in 2009 the epa began a process to collect data on emitters of greater than 25000 tons of greenhouse gas per year twentyfour of our us facilities and six closed landfills are covered by and submitted reports as required under this rule we do not believe that the reporting rule has had nor will have a material impact on our operations additionally the epa has indicated that it will propose new source performance standards nsps for various industry sectors which will limit ghg emissions from certain sources currently the epa has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources will be subject to new nsps rules it is uncertain what impacts if any future nsps will have on international paper’s operations the epa has convened a science advisory board sab to assess the neutrality of biomass when combusted in new sources the sab began deliberations in 2011 and submitted recommendations to epa in late 2012 it is not clear what if any of the sab recommendations epa will act on or the timeframe in which they may take action because the use of biomass is prevalent in the pulp and paper production process the findings of the sab and how they are incorporated into climate policy and subsequent regulations could be material to the industry and the company 

some us states have considered legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the 

 

planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs one such state is california international paper does not have any sites currently subject to californias ghg regulatory plan there may be indirect impacts from changing input costs such as electricity at some of our california converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts we are monitoring proposed programs in other states 

it is difficult to predict whether passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various us states or the adoption of regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may have a material effect on our operations in the us in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects 

international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate to ensure we continue to assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

in summary regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability  we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 

our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences 

fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results  we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product innovations manufacturing and operating efficiencies and marketing distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations  general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial con 

dition and impair our ability to operate our business  as of december 31 2012  international paper had approximately 101 billion of outstanding indebtedness including 0 of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and 96 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could   adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities  maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of the company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or further reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 46 billion of our debt as of 

december 31 2012  the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating as a result a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes  we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to the company in connection with our 2006 sale of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2006 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement ongoing uncertainty in the banking environment continues including continued uncertainty with respect to whether the eurozone will emerge from its sovereign debt crisis and the rating agencies’ ongoing reassessment of bank ratings as a result a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained see note 11 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries on pages 69 through 72 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change  we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in 

 

increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business  we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2012  was 41 billion this includes liability for the international paper company pension plans as well as the templeinland retirement plan and the templeinland supplemental executive retirement plan for which we have responsibility in connection with the templeinland acquisition the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland china and india where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the 

imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and requirements could impact our business and results of operations  our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and national ambient air quality standards naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws regulations codes and common law the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results  we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise 

 

operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology that manages operations and other business processes  international paper business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks network system application and data breaches could 

result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit  several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia and the recently established orsa international paper joint venture in brazil in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures  our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to accomplish prudent strategic acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits among the benefits we expect from potential as well as recently completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers placing higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper 

 

for example on december 12 2012 the company signed an agreement to divest our templeinland building products business unit to georgiapacific llc our ability to complete the transaction is subject to certain conditions including approval of the transaction by the us department of justice failure to consummate the agreed sale to georgiapacific could result in significant delay in accomplishing a divestiture of templeinland building products and inability to reach an agreement with one or more alternative purchasers on terms as favorable as the agreement with georgiapacific

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

operating earnings a nongaap measure is defined as net earnings from continuing operations a gaap measure excluding special items and nonoperating pension expense international paper generated operating earnings per diluted share attributable to common shareholders of 265  in 2012  compared with 312  in 2011  and 230  in 2010  diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 180  in 2012  compared with 303  in 2011  and 159  in 2010  

international paper delivered strong results during 2012 despite challenging global economic conditions and generated record cash flow from operations of 3 billion our results were primarily driven by the templeinland acquisition and associated integration synergies that exited the year at a run rate above our firstyear plan we also divested three mills required as a condition to close the templeinland acquisition and announced an agreement to divest the building products business acquired with templeinland these divestitures combined will generate more than 12 billion of cash once the building products divestiture closes 

our global operations continued to execute well and deliver on our cost management objectives contributing to another year of generating returns above our cost of capital we reduced our balance sheet debt by 19 billion since the templeinland acquisition closed and increased our annual dividend by 14 to 120 per share we also made significant progress on our strategic and costreduction projects including the franklin fluff pulp mill conversion the biomass boiler at our mogi guacu mill in brazil and our new coated paperboard machine in china among others we also finalized two acquisitions in turkey and brazil during the 2013 first quarter that were announced in 2012 we believe these strategic and costsaving projects position international paper well for a stepchange in earnings in 2013 

summarizing our 2012 operations the templeinland acquisition built a strong foundation for steadily improving as well as less cyclical earnings going forward the acquisition and impressive integration were meaningfully earnings accretive in less than twelve months while the slower global growth environment took its toll on pricing in pulp consumer grades and export shipments across all our product lines the worst seems to be behind us as pulp markets have stabilized and rebounded from the bottom and export markets in containerboard have recovered in the second half of the year it was another year of excellent execution across 

 

our global operations as the performance of our mills more than offset rampup costs associated with the franklin fluff pulp mill conversion and the coated paperboard machine startup at our ipsun joint venture in china lower average input costs helped us offset the absence of significant favorable inventory valuation adjustments that we experienced in 2011 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 we expect seasonally weaker volume in our europerussia and brazil papers businesses and stable demand across our north american businesses we expect the full benefit of our 2012 fourth quarter north american box price increase to be realized during the 2013 first quarter but it will be partially offset by unfavorable seasonal mix issues in brazil operationally we should see the impact of improved performance across our mill businesses as supply chain conditions improve and onetime unfavorable issues from the 2012 fourth quarter do not repeat further lower costs at franklin and the full impact of the biomass boiler in brazil should provide additional earnings momentum as to input costs we expect higher costs for recycled fiber wood and energy the 2013 first quarter will be another heavy maintenance outage quarter with only a modest decrease in expenses expected 

for the 2013 full year our outlook for enduse demand is based on global economic growth of three to four percent and growth in the us of one to two percent our largest lever this year is the trajectory of our north american industrial packaging business with yearoveryear earnings improvement due to pricing and continued system optimization further the rampup of our many strategic and cost saving projects during the course of the year is expected to drive significant incremental earnings in 2013 versus 2012 we do however expect higher input costs primarily associated with fiber and energy and an unfavorable impact associated with the lost earnings and incremental containerboard purchases from the divested mills 

free cash flow a nongaap measure of 16 billion  generated in 2012  was lower than the 17 billion  generated in both 2011  and 2010  see reconciliation on page 33 

operating earnings per share attributable to common shareholders of 069  in the fourth quarter of 2012 were lower than both the 081  in the 2012 third quarter and the 073  in the 2011 fourth quarter diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 053  in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with 054  in the third quarter of 2012 and 065  in the fourth quarter of 2011 

free cash flow of 384 million  generated in the 2012  fourth quarter was lower than the 567 million  generated in the 2012  third quarter but slightly higher than the 328 million   

generated in the 2011  fourth quarter see reconciliation on page 33 

operating earnings is a nongaap measure diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders is the most direct comparable gaap measure the company calculates operating earnings by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap and nonoperating pension expense management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations the following are reconciliations of operating earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders to diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders 

  



 



results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes equity earnings noncontrolling interests interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in four segments industrial packaging printing papers consumer packaging and distribution effective january 1 2011 the forest products business is no longer being reported by the company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings loss attributable to international paper company to its total industry segment operating profit 

  



industry segment operating profits of 20 billion  in 2012  included a net loss from special items of 335 million compared with 253 million in 2011  and 344 million in 2010  operationally compared with 2011 the impacts of templeinland volumes and synergies 379 million and lower input costs 113 million were offset by higher costs associated with templeinland stepup depreciation and the impact of divesting three containerboard mills 141 million lower average sales price realizations and an unfavorable mix 313 million higher operating costs 186 million and higher mill maintenance outage costs31 million 

 

   

the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows 

  

 

 



realizations and a less favorable product mix lower sales volumes and higher marketrelated downtime and higher operating expenses operating profits in 2011 included costs of 201 million associated with the fixed asset impairment and sale of the shorewood business 

   

corporate items net of 51 million  of expense in 2012  were lower than the 102 million  of expense in 2011  due to lower supply chain initiative expenses the decrease in 2011  from 2010  primarily reflects lower supply chain initiative expenses 

corporate special items including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of 49 million  in 2012  compared with a loss of 76 million in 2011  and a loss of 45 million  in 2010  

interest expense net was 672 million  in 2012  compared with 541 million  in 2011  and 608 million  in 2010  the increase in 2012  reflects higher interest expense associated with the templeinland acquisition while the decrease in 2011  reflects lower debt levels throughout much of the year 

a net income tax provision of 331 million  was recorded for 2012  including a net expense of 14 million related to internal restructurings and an expense of 5 million to adjust deferred tax assets related to postretirement prescription drug coverage medicare part d reimbursements the 2011  income tax provision of 311 million  includes a tax benefit of 222 million related to the reduction of the carrying value of the shorewood business and the writeoff of a deferred tax liability associated with shorewood a 24 million expense related to internal restructurings a 9 million expense for costs associated with our acquisition of a majority interest in andhra pradesh paper mills limited a 13 million benefit related to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a 2 million expense for other items the 2010  income tax provision of 221 million  includes a 14 million tax expense for an incentive compensation deferred tax writeoff a 32 million tax expense for a medicare part d deferred tax writeoff and a 40 million net tax benefit related to cellulosic biofuel credits 

discontinued operations 

in 2012  54 million  of operating profits for the templeinland building products business were recorded in discontinued operations in addition 9 million  of after 

 

tax expenses associated with pursuing the divestiture of this business were included 

in 2011  49 million  of net income adjustments were recorded relating to prior sales of discontinued businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2012  international paper generated 30 billion  of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 27 billion  in 2011  capital spending for 2012  totaled 14 billion  or 93  of depreciation and amortization expense cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled 37 billion  while net decreases in debt totaled 356 million  our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 25 billion  of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

we expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2013  and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects the reduction of total debt including the company’s unfunded pension obligation returning value to shareholders and strengthening our businesses through acquisitions as appropriate 

capital spending for 2013  is targeted at 14 billion  or about 93  of depreciation and amortization

corporate overview 

while the operating results for international paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of businessspecific factors changes in international paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america europe russia latin america asia and north africa factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and movements in currency exchange rates 

product prices are affected by general economic trends inventory levels currency movements and worldwide capacity utilization in addition to these revenuerelated factors net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs principally wood recycled fiber and chemical costs energy costs freight costs salary and benefits costs including pensions and manufacturing conversion costs

industry segment results 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production as well as with demand for processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging   net sales and operating profits for 2012 include the results of the templeinland packaging operations from the date of acquisition net sales for 2012   increased   27  to 133 billion  compared with 104 billion  in 2011  and 35  compared with 98 billion  in 2010  operating profits were 7   lower  in 2012  than in 2011  and 29   higher  than in 2010  excluding costs associated with the acquisition and integration of templeinland the divestiture of three containerboard mills and other special items operating profits in 2012 were 17 higher than in 2011 and 60 higher than in 2010 benefits from templeinland synergies and sales volumes 375 million and lower input costs 124 million were partially offset by higher costs associated with templeinland stepup depreciation and the impact of the divestiture of three containerboard mills 141 million lower average sales price realizations and unfavorable mix 20 million higher operating costs 

125 million and higher maintenance outage costs 18 million additionally operating profits in 2012 include costs of 184 million associated with the acquisition and integration of templeinland mill divestiture costs of 91 million costs associated with the restructuring of our european packaging business of 17 million and a 3 million gain for other items while operating costs in 2011 included costs associated with signing an agreement to acquire templeinland of 20 million and a gain of 7 million for other items 

  



north american industrial packaging   net sales were 116 billion  in 2012  compared with 86 billion  in 2011  and 84 billion  in 2010  operating profits in 2012  were 10 billion  13 billion excluding costs associated with the acquisition and integration of templeinland and mill divestiture costs compared with 11 billion  both including and excluding costs associated with signing an agreement to acquire templeinland in 2011  and 763 million   776 million  excluding facility closure costs in 2010  

sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011 average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year input costs were lower for recycled fiber wood and natural gas but higher for starch freight costs also increased planned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from 235 million of templeinland synergies marketrelated downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with about 380000 tons in 2011 operating profits in 2012 included 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of templeinland and 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills operating profits in 2011 included charges of 20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire templeinland 

looking ahead to 2013 sales volumes in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the passthrough to box customers of a containerboard price increase implemented in 2012 input costs are expected to be higher for recycled fiber wood and starch planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about 26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter 

 

manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower 

european industrial packaging   net sales were 10 billion  in 2012  compared with 11 billion  in 2011  and 990 million  in 2010  operating profits in 2012  were 53 million   72 million excluding restructuring costs compared with 66 million   61 million  excluding a gain for a bargain purchase price adjustment on an acquisition by our joint venture in turkey and costs associated with the closure of our etienne mill in france in 2009 in 2011  and 70 million   73 million  before closure costs for our etienne mill in 2010  

sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern europe demand for packaging in the agricultural markets was about flat yearoveryear average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs other input costs were higher primarily for energy and distribution operating profits in 2012 included a net gain of 10 million for an insurance settlement partially offset by additional operating costs related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant 

entering the first quarter of 2013 sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard other input costs should be about flat operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quarter 

asian industrial packaging   net sales and operating profits include the results of sca packaging since the acquisition on june 30 2010 including the impact of incremental integration costs net sales for the packaging operations were 400 million  in 2012  compared with 410 million  in 2011  and 255 million  in 2010  operating profits for the packaging operations were 2 million  in 2012  compared with 2 million  in 2011  and a loss of 7 million  a loss of 4 million  excluding facility closure costs in 2010  operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality 

net sales for the distribution operations were 260 million  in 2012  compared with 285 million  in 2011  and 240 million  in 2010  operating profits were 3 million  in 2012  compared with 3 million  in 2011  and about breakeven in 2010  

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs and freight costs 

printing papers   net sales for 2012  were about flat with 2011  and increased 5  from 2010  operating profits in 2012  were 31   lower  than in 2011  but 25   higher  than in 2010  excluding facility closure costs and impairment costs operating profits in 2012 were 30 lower than in 2011 and 25 lower than in 2010 benefits from higher sales volumes 58 million were more than offset by lower sales price realizations and an unfavorable product mix 233 million higher operating costs 30 million higher maintenance outage costs 17 million higher input costs 32 million and other items 6 million in addition operating profits in 2011 included a 24 million gain related to the announced repurposing of our franklin virginia mill to produce fluff pulp and an 11 million impairment charge related to our inverurie scotland mill that was closed in 2009 

  



north american printing papers   net sales were 27 billion  in 2012  28 billion  in 2011  and 28 billion  in 2010  operating profits in 2012  were 331 million  compared with 423 million   399 million  excluding a 24 million gain associated with the repurposing of our franklin virginia mill in 2011  and 18 million   333 million  excluding facility closure costs in 2010  

sales volumes in 2012 were flat with 2011 average sales margins were lower primarily due to lower export sales prices and higher export sales volume input costs were higher for wood and chemicals but were partially offset by lower purchased pulp costs freight costs increased due to higher oil prices manufacturing operating costs were favorable reflecting strong mill performance planned maintenance downtime costs were slightly higher in 2012 no marketrelated downtime was taken in either 2012 or 2011 

entering the first quarter of 2013 sales volumes are expected to increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 reflecting seasonally stronger demand 

 

average sales price realizations are expected to be relatively flat as sales price realizations for domestic and export uncoated freesheet roll and cutsize paper should be stable input costs should increase for energy chemicals and wood planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about 19 million lower with an outage scheduled at our georgetown mill versus outages at our courtland and eastover mills in the fourth quarter of 2012 

brazilian papers   net sales for 2012  were 11 billion  compared with 12 billion  in 2011  and 11 billion  in 2010  operating profits for 2012  were 163 million  compared with 169 million  in 2011  and 159 million  in 2010  sales volumes in 2012 were higher than in 2011 as international paper improved its segment position in the brazilian market despite weaker yearoveryear conditions in most markets average sales price realizations improved for domestic uncoated freesheet paper but the benefit was more than offset by declining prices for exported paper margins were favorably affected by an increased proportion of sales to the highermargin domestic market raw material costs increased for wood and chemicals but costs for purchased pulp decreased operating costs and planned maintenance downtime costs were lower than in 2011 

looking ahead to 2013 sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to seasonally weaker customer demand for uncoated freesheet paper average sales price realizations are expected to increase in the brazilian domestic market due to the realization of an announced sales price increase for uncoated freesheet paper but the benefit should be partially offset by pricing pressures in export markets average sales margins are expected to be negatively impacted by a less favorable geographic mix input costs are expected to be about flat due to lower energy costs being offset by higher costs for wood purchased pulp chemicals and utilities planned maintenance outage costs should be 4 million lower with no outages scheduled in the first quarter operating costs should be favorably impacted by the savings generated by the startup of a new biomass boiler at the mogi guacu mill 

european papers   net sales in 2012  were 14 billion  compared with 14 billion  in 2011  and 13 billion  in 2010  operating profits in 2012  were 179 million  compared with 196 million   207 million  excluding asset impairment charges related to our inverurie scotland mill which was closed in 2009 in 2011  and 197 million   199 million  excluding an asset impairment charge in 2010  

sales volumes in 2012 compared with 2011 were higher for uncoated freesheet paper in both europe and russia while sales volumes for pulp were lower in both regions average sales price realizations for uncoated 

freesheet paper were higher in russia but lower in europe reflecting weak economic conditions and market demand average sales price realizations for pulp decreased lower input costs for wood and purchased fiber were partially offset by higher costs for energy chemicals and packaging freight costs were also higher planned maintenance downtime costs were higher due to executing a significant onceeverytenyears maintenance outage plus the regularly scheduled 18month outage at the saillat mill while outage costs in russia and poland were lower manufacturing operating costs were favorable 

entering 2013 sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be seasonally weaker in russia but about flat in europe average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper are expected to decrease in europe but increase in russia input costs should be higher in russia especially for wood and energy but be slightly lower in europe no maintenance outages are scheduled for the first quarter 

indian papers   includes the results of andhra pradesh paper mills appm of which a 75 interest was acquired on october 14 2011 net sales were 185 million  in 2012  and 35 million  in 2011  operating profits were a loss of 16 million  in 2012  and a loss of 3 million  in 2011

sales volumes in 2012 increased from 2011 primarily due to the startup of pulp production at the franklin mill in the third quarter of 2012 average sales price realizations were significantly lower for both fluff pulp and market pulp input costs were lower primarily for wood and energy freight costs were slightly lower mill operating costs were unfavorable primarily due to costs associated with the startup of the franklin mill planned maintenance downtime costs were lower 

in the first quarter of 2013 sales volumes are expected to be flat with the fourth quarter of 2012 average sales price realizations are expected to improve reflecting the realization of sales price increases for paper and tissue pulp that were announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 input costs should be flat planned maintenance downtime costs should be about 9 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2012 manufacturing costs related to the franklin mill should be lower as we continue to improve operations

equity earnings net of taxes – ilim holding sa 

international paper accounts for its investment in ilim holding sa ilim a separate reportable industry segment using the equity method of accounting prior to 2012 due to the complex organizational structure of ilim’s operations and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the company reported its share of ilim’s operating results on a onequarter lag basis in 2012 the company determined that the elimination of the onequarter lag was preferable because the same periodend reporting date improves overall financial reporting as the impact of current events economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements beginning january 1 2012 the company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial reporting periods presented 

the elimination of the onequarter reporting lag for ilim had the following impact 

consolidated statement of operations 



consolidated balance sheet 



the company recorded equity earnings net of taxes related to ilim of 56 million  in 2012 compared with 134 million  in 2011 and 102 million  in 2010 operating results recorded in 2012 included an aftertax foreign 

 

exchange gain of 16 million on the remeasurement of us dollardenominated debt operating results recorded in 2011 included an aftertax foreign exchange loss of 24 million on the remeasurement of us dollardenominated debt 

sales volumes for the joint venture increased yearoveryear for shipments to china and other export markets linerboard sales in the domestic russian market decreased slightly reflecting competitive price pressures in late 2012 average sales price realizations were significantly lower in 2012 primarily for softwood pulp but hardwood pulp and linerboard also decreased in both the russian domestic market and in export markets input costs increased yearoveryear primarily for wood freight costs also increased the company received cash dividends from the joint venture of 86 million in 2011 and 33 million in 2010 no dividends were paid in 2012 

entering the first quarter of 2013 sales volumes are expected to decrease due to weak demand in the export markets and a seasonal slowdown in the domestic market average sales price realizations are expected to increase reflecting higher pulp and linerboard prices in the russian domestic market and slightly higher export pulp prices lower input costs for wood will be partially offset by higher energy costs while distribution costs are expected to increase commissioning of a new pulp line at the bratsk mill and a coated and uncoated woodfree paper machine at the koryazhma mill will be completed in the first quarter with commercial production beginning in the second quarter as these projects are placed in service higher depreciation and interest expense will negatively impact earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america 

cash uses during 2012  were primarily focused on higher capital spending and the templeinland acquisition 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 30 billion  in 2012  compared with 27 billion  for 2011  and 16 billion  for 2010  

the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items decreased by 304 million  in 2012  versus 2011  driven mainly by a decrease in earnings from continuing operations cash used for working capital components accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 84 million  in 2012  compared with 505 million  in 2011  and 458 million  in 2010  

the company generated free cash flow of approximately 16 billion  17 billion  and 17 billion  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets make investments or acquisitions pay dividends and reduce debt the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations 

  



 



cellulosic biofuel tax credit 

in a memorandum dated june 28 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor would qualify for the cellulosic biofuel tax credit of 101  per gallon produced in 2009 on october 15 2010 the irs ruled that companies may qualify in the same year for the 050  per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the 101  cellulosic biofuel tax credit for 2009 but not for the same gallons of fuel produced and consumed to the extent a taxpayer changes its position and uses the 101  credit it must repay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic biofuel credit the repayment of this refund must include interest 

one important difference between the two credits is that the 101  credit must be credited against a company’s federal tax liability and the credit may be carried forward through 2015 in contrast the 050  credit is refundable in cash also the cellulosic biofuel credit is required to be included in federal taxable income 

the company filed an application with the irs on november 18 2010 to receive the required registration code to become a registered cellulosic biofuel producer the company received its registration code on february 28 2011 

the company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009 considerations include uncertainty around future federal taxable income the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit future liquidity and uses of cash such as but not limited to acquisitions debt repayments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture credits with interest at the present time the company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic biofuel credit on july 19 2011 the company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as non 

taxable income if that amended position is not upheld the company will reevaluate its position with regard to alternative fuel mixture gallons produced in 2009 

during 2009 the company produced 64 million  gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit the company claimed these gallons for the cellulosic biofuel credit by amending the company’s 2009 tax return the impact of this amendment was included in the company’s 2010 fourth quarter income tax provision benefit resulting in a 40 million  net credit to tax expense templeinland also recognized an income tax benefit of 83 million  in 2010 related to cellulosic biofuel credits 

as is the case with other tax credits taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the irs which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed or credits received

 we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2012  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2012  the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 840 million we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2012  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 41 billion  higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 37 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefitsthe projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make voluntary contributions totaling 44 million  and 300 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively at this time we expect that required contributions to its plans in 2013  will be approximately 31 million although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future 

 

remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for 

each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2012  2011  or 2010  

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2012  for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows 

  



the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 



 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

  



international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025  would decrease increase 2013  pension expense by approximately 24 million  while a decrease increase of 025  in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 39 million  the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1  increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately 1 million  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

  



the 2012 return above represents a weighted average of international paper and templeinland asset returns the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 50  and 99  for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2002 – 2012 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately nine years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 490 million  and 34 million  respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

  



the increase in 2012  us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the discount rate a lower expected return on assets assumption and the acquisition of templeinland the decrease in 2012 us postretirement expense is principally due to a curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of the templeinland plan 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2012  projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

  

 



 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 561 million  for its us defined benefit plans in 2013  with the increase from expense of 342 million  in 2012  reflecting a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 410 in 2013 from 510 in 2012 a lower return on asset assumption for templeinland plan assets to 530 in 2013 from 570 in 2012 and higher amortization of unrecognized losses 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2012  totaled approximately 101 billion  consisting of approximately 41  equity securities 38  debt securities 10  real estate and 11  other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future the required contribution for the us qualified pension plans in 2013 is approximately 31 million the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 95 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  

accounting for stock options 

international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by 

the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2012  and 2011  91 million  options and 156 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 3374 to 4126 per share for 2012  and 3254 to 4312 per share for 2011  

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 32  21  and 27  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2012  was 29  of pretax earnings compared with 32  in 2011  and 30  in 2010  we estimate that the 2013  effective income tax rate will be approximately 3133 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

 

recent accounting developments 

there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 2 recent accounting developments on pages 54 through 55 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

legal proceedings 

information concerning the company’s environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 10 commitments and contingencies on pages 65 through 69 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for 

trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 debt and lines of credit on pages 72 and 73 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 13 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 73 through 77 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2012  and 2011  are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2012  and 2011  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 118 billion  and 105 billion  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 642 million  and 505 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2012  and 2011  was approximately 1 million  and 10 million  respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 1 million  and 2 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2012  and 2011  the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 13 million  and 52 million  respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 49 million  and 59 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

  



 

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2012  management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on pages 43 and 44 management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012  

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit and finance committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 of this annual report under the heading “financial statements and supplementary data” deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of four independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2012  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

the company completed the acquisition of templeinland in february 2012 due to the timing of the acquisition we have excluded templeinland from our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the period ended december 31 2012  templeinland net sales and assets represented approximately 19 of net sales and 25 of total assets

research and development 

the company operates its primary research and development center in loveland ohio as well as several product laboratories additionally the company has an interest in arborgen inc a joint venture with certain other forest products companies 

we direct research and development activities to shortterm longterm and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions and to process equipment and product innovations activities include product development within the operating divisions studies on innovation and improvement of pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking converting and coating processes packaging design and materials development mechanical packaging systems environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges reuse of raw materials in manufacturing processes recycling of consumer and packaging paper products energy conservation applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations innovations and improvement of products and development of various new products our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste the cost to the company of its research and development operations was 13 million in 2011 12 million in 2010 and 13 million in 2009

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 60 million was spent in 2011 for capital projects to control environmental 

releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 90 million in 2012 for similar capital projects 

in the us the environmental protection agency epa proposed or finalized a number of new rules including greenhouse gas mandatory reporting see climate change section boiler mact see below and more restrictive national ambient air quality standards naaqss during 2010 new naaqss were promulgated for nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide so 2  and we anticipate that additional naaqss will also be promulgated once implemented these rules could require significant investments of capital andor operational changes that could potentially have a material impact on international paper 

in march 2011 the epa published four interrelated final rules commonly and collectively referred to as “boiler mact” as finalized these rules required owners of specified boilers to meet very strict air emissions standards for certain substances the rule was immediately subject to administrative reconsideration by the epa in addition to putting certain portions of the rules into the administrative reconsideration process the epa also issued an administrative stay of the rules pending the outcome of the reconsideration process on december 23 2011 the epa published new proposed rules that have a 60day comment period that ended february 21 2012 the epa indicated their intent is to finalize these latest proposals by spring 2012 these proposals if finalized would change many aspects of the march 2011 rules including but not limited to emission limits and control equipment technology needed to meet such limits on january 9 2012 in sierra club v lisa p jackson us district court for the district of columbia civil action no 111278 the court found the administrative stay issued by the epa to be unlawful and vacated the stay as a result the final rules published in march 2011 are in effect despite the fact that the epa is in the process of reconsidering these rules vacating the stay as well as the reconsideration process and the numerous lawsuits filed on these rules has created significant legal uncertainties because of these significant uncertainties it is difficult to accurately and comprehensively estimate at this time what our costs will be to comply with the rules 

in addition to boiler mact on december 27 2011 the epa also issued a proposed rule to amend national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap for the pulp and paper industry the 

 

  

comment period for this proposed rule closes february 27 2012 unless it is extended we are currently reviewing the rule and determining what impacts it could have on our operations while we do not have firm cost estimates at this time and recognizing the proposed rule is likely to change the rule could have a significant adverse impact on the pulp and paper industry including international paper 

recognizing these many significant uncertainties our forecasts include an estimate of future expenditures that may be required for boiler mact and other regulatory initiatives these amounts represent our current best estimate of future expenditures which we believe are likely to change once the regulatory landscape becomes clearer our preliminary estimate for environmental control expenditures is approximately 105 million for 2013 and approximately 260 million for 2014 when regulatory requirements regarding boiler mact and the pulp and paper neshap become final including likely subsequent legal challenges the company’s environmental manufacturing and legal professionals will assess fully the potential impacts on our company to determine a more precise estimate of future environmental control expenditures 

climate change 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded with an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of international national and subnational regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations apply currently or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

while the european union eu has ratified the kyoto protocol the framework of the kyoto protocol does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” four countries where we have papermaking operations india brazil morocco and china are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol although not subject to the kyoto protocol brazil and china may adopt greenhouse gas regulations in the future that may have a material effect on our operations in these countries unless extended the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 a successor to the kyoto protocol is under negotiation at the international level due to the lack of clarity around the post2012 climate control regime it is not possible at this 

time to estimate with any certainty the potential impacts of future international agreements on international paper’s operations 

under the european union emissions trading system euets the eu has committed to greenhouse gas reductions international paper has two sites covered by the euets these measures did not have an adverse effect on our european operations in 2011 nor are they expected to have such an impact in 2012 

the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol nor have efforts in the us congress to legislate the control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions been successful to date the activity in the us has been spearheaded by the us epa and to some extent by the states pursuant to its ghg mandatory reporting rule promulgated in 2009 the epa began a process to collect data on emitters of greater than 25000 tons of greenhouse gas per year twenty of our us facilities are covered by and submitted reports as required under this rule we do not believe that the reporting rule will have a material impact on our operations additionally the epa has indicated that it will propose new source performance standards nsps for various industry sectors which will limit ghg emissions from certain sources currently the epa has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources will be subject to new nsps rules it is uncertain what impacts if any future nsps will have on international paper’s operations the epa has convened a science advisory board sab to assess the neutrality of biomass when combusted in new sources the sab began deliberations in 2011 but has not made any recommendations because the use of biomass is prevalent in the pulp and paper production process the findings of the sab and how they are incorporated into climate policy and subsequent regulations could be material to the industry and the company 

some us states have considered legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs one such state is california where international paper has one site subject to california’s ghg regulatory plan the final california rules are still being developed and do not take full effect until 2013 until the rules are finalized and implemented it is unknown whether there will be any significant impact on our california facility 

 

  

it is difficult to predict whether passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various us states or the adoption of regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may have a material effect on our operations in the us in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects 

international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate to ensure we continue to assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

in summary regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper including our carbon footprint is available at httpinternationalpapercomusencompanysustainabilityclimatehtml  

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 61500 employees 34400 of whom were located in the united states of the us employees approximately 22400 are hourly with unions representing approximately 13500 employees approximately 9900 of the union employees are represented by the united steel workers usw

these two agreements the mill and converting master agreements cover several specific items 

including but not limited to wages select benefit programs successorship employment security and health and safety individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other items not covered by these agreements if local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration then under the master agreements the local facility agreements will automatically renew with the same terms in effect at the time of expiration

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 

our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product or pricing strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial con 

 

  

dition and impair our ability to operate our business as of december 31 2011 international paper had approximately 99 billion of outstanding indebtedness including 0 of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and 95 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our floating and fixed rate notes the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition operating results and business including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the 

market price of our securities including the notes maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets suspension or further reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital 

under the terms of the agreements governing approximately 47 billion of our debt as of december 31 2011 the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating as a result a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 

downgrades in the credit ratings of banks supporting certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining such indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes we are subject to the risk that a bank that issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with our 2006 sale of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating since 2006 certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in the banking environment including the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the rating agencies’ reassessment of bank ratings a number of the letterofcredit banks currently in place are subject to an increased risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks has decreased the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or 

 

  

could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained see note 11 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2011 was 24 billion the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland china and india where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctua 

tions in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including governmental subsidies tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries in addition our international operations are subject to regulation under us law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions for example the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits us companies and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and requirements could impact our business and results of operations our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations boiler mact and national ambient air quality standards naaqss will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions enforcement actions including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict and in some cases liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances 

  

 

  

results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial condition any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company customer employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology that manages operations and other business processes international paper business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent third party verification our information technology systems and those of our third party providers could become subject to cyber attacks network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including but not limited to interruption to systems availability denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper access to internal applications required to plan our operations source materials manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents any of these operational disruptions andor misappropriation of information could result in lost sales business delays negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business 

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our 

 

  

relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures for additional information with respect to our ilim joint venture see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – liquidity and capital resources – ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement on page 44 

we may not achieve the expected benefits from our recent acquisition of templeinland or from other strategic acquisitions and divestitures on february 13 2012 we completed our acquisition of templeinland in a transaction valued at approximately 45 billion as a condition to allowing the transaction to proceed the antitrust division of the us department of justice entered into an agreement with the company that requires us to divest three containerboard mills with approximately 970000 tons of aggregate containerboard capacity within four months of closing with the possibility of two 30day extensions 

the success of the templeinland acquisition will depend in part on our ability to divest these mills successfully and to realize the anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating templeinland with our existing businesses the integration process may be complex costly and timeconsuming and we may not accomplish the integration of templeinland smoothly successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe potential integration risks include among other things our ability to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business retain key customers suppliers and employees and retain and obtain required regulatory approvals licenses and permits in addition templeinland’s obligations and liabilities some of which may not have not been disclosed to us or may not be reflected or reserved for in templeinland’s financial statements may be greater than we have anticipated and we do not have the benefit of any indemnification in the merger agreement with respect to obligations or liabilities of templeinland whether known or unknown potential liabilities of templeinland include but are not limited to 

 



  

 more broadly our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and divestitures and to realize the benefits we expect from them and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper generated diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations and before special items of 310 during 2011 compared with 205 in 2010 and 088 in 2009 diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 307 for 2011 compared with 148 for 2010 and 155 for 2009 

our 2011 fullyear results from continuing operations and before special charges represented our best financial results in almost two decades 2011 benefited from margin expansion due to increased price realizations that stayed with us throughout the year and improved mix and excellent operations and cost management which combined to more than offset higher input costs of 061 per share we also benefited from a 021 increase in earnings from our ilim joint venture in russia which experienced yearoveryear revenue growth of 26 

in north america sales volumes were down slightly but sales revenue was up moderately reflecting increased price flow through and strong margin expansion of 200 basis points outside the us we increased earnings but in different ways margins were stable but we also saw a 6 increase in sales volumes contributing to a 17 increase in sales revenue 

free cash flow for 2011 was stable with 2010 at approximately 17 billion see reconciliation on page 35 even though 2011 included an increase of approximately 380 million in capital expenditures this strong free cash flow resulted in a 400 million increase in our yearend cash balance over 2010 after deducting 15 billion borrowed in anticipation of the acquisition of templeinland which closed on february 13 2012 we also made a 300 million voluntary contribution to strengthen the health of our pension plan in 2011 

diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations and before special items of 066 in the fourth quarter of 2011 were lower than both the 092 in the 2011 third quarter and the 068 in the 2010 fourth quarter diluted earnings loss per share attributable to common shareholders were 059 in the fourth quar 

ter of 2011 compared with 119 in the third quarter of 2011 and 073 in the fourth quarter of 2010 

our 2011 fourth quarter results were in line with our original expectation as we experienced normal seasonal weakness in north america and some related downward pricing pressure primarily in market pulp and exports from north america in both paper and packaging additionally a significant negative currency impact at ilim nearly erased their earnings contribution for the quarter ilim is reported on a onequarter lag basis these headwinds were somewhat offset by benefits from our global balance including seasonally stronger demand in paper sales in brazil russia and europe as well as stronger box volumes and improved margins in emea and some global input cost relief in fiber and energy 

free cash flow of 328 million generated in the 2011 fourth quarter was lower than the 561 million generated in the 2011 third quarter and the 601 million generated in the 2010 fourth quarter see reconciliation on page 36 these decreases were partially due to an increase in capital spending of approximately 120 million over both previous periods the decrease from the 2011 third quarter was also driven by lower earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda while a decrease in cash inflows related to working capital accounted for the remainder of the decrease versus the 2010 fourth quarter 

as we have said before we believe we are operating in an economy that is recovering but not fully recovered while our first quarter is always a seasonally slow period we expect modest increases in volume in north america in the 2012 first quarter versus the 2011 fourth quarter primarily in packaging – due to four more box shipping days – and increased exports in our papers business the continued pass through of previously negotiated export price reductions in packaging paper and pulp will materially impact price realizations in the first quarter additionally in brazil seasonally weaker domestic demand will result in a greater percentage of lowerpriced paper exports in the quarter which will negatively impact earnings as to inputs slightly higher costs in north america primarily for wood and chemicals will largely offset the benefit of lower overall mill outages during the quarter earnings for xpedx our distribution business in the us will decrease as the first quarter is a seasonally low shipment period the contribution from our ilim joint venture will improve based largely on the absence of the negative currency impact of the 2011 fourth quarter but run rate earnings reflecting the onequarter lag in reporting will be lower than the 

 

  

peak levels reported in the 2011 second quarter as we feel the full impact of pulp price erosion over this period finally manufacturing operations and all other costs associated with the businesses will materially reduce earnings in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily driven by expected onetime costs associated with the pending startups later this year at both our franklin mill and the sun joint venture in china seasonally higher costs related to the consumption of energy and fuels primarily due to colder weather the absence of beneficial onetime adjustments in the 2011 fourth quarter related to companypaid benefits and lastly the absence of our favorable adjustments related to inventory revaluations experienced in the 2011 fourth quarter 

earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders before special items is a nongaap measure diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company shareholders is the most direct comparable gaap measure the company calculates earnings per share before special items by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations the following are reconciliations of earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders before special items to diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders 

 

 

 results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes equity earnings noncontrolling interests interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in four segments industrial packaging printing papers consumer packaging and distribution effective january 1 2011 the forest products business is no longer being reported by the company as a separate industry segment due to the immateriality of the results of the remaining business on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings loss attributable to international paper company to its total industry segment operating profit 

 

 industry segment operating profits of 22 billion in 2011 included a net loss from special items of 253 million compared with 344 million in 2010 and a net gain of 898 million in 2009 which included the impact of alternative fuel mixture credits operationally compared with 2010 the impacts of higher sales price realizations 611 million and improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 370 million were partially offset by lower sales volumes 54 million higher input costs 381 million lower gains from land sales 94 million and other items 13 million 

 

the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows 

 

  

  

  



 

  

  

 corporate items net of 145 million of expense in 2011 were lower than the 226 million of expense in 2010 due to lower supply chain initiative expenses and lower pension expense the increase in 2010 from 2009 primarily reflects higher pension expense 

corporate special items including restructuring and other items and net losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of 76 million in 2011 compared with a loss of 45 million in 2010 and a loss of 334 million in 2009 

interest expense net was 541 million in 2011 compared with 608 million in 2010 and 669 million in 2009 the decrease in 2011 reflects lower debt levels throughout much of the year while the decrease in 2010 reflects the repayment of 31 billion of debt in 2009 

a net income tax provision of 311 million was recorded for 2011 including a tax benefit of 222 million related to the reduction of the carrying value of the shorewood business and the writeoff of a deferred tax liability associated with shorewood a 24 million expense related to internal restructurings a 9 million expense for costs associated with our acquisition of a majority interest in andhra pradesh paper mills limited a 13 million benefit related to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a 2 million expense for other items the 2010 income tax provision of 221 million includes a 14 million tax expense for an incentive compensation deferred tax writeoff a 32 million tax expense for a medicare part d deferred tax writeoff and a 40 million net tax benefit related to cellulosic biofuel credits the 2009 income tax provision of 469 million includes a net 165 million provision related to 2009 special tax adjustment items excluding the tax effect of all special items taxes as a percent of pretax earnings were 32 in 2011 and 30 in both 2010 and 2009 the higher income tax rate in 2011 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 

discontinued operations 

in 2011 49 million of net income adjustments were recorded relating to prior sales of discontinued businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2011 international paper generated 27 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 16 billion in 2010 capital spending for 2011 totaled 12 billion or 87 of depreciation and amortization expense cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled 379 million while net increases in debt totaled 13 billion primarily representing debt incurred in anticipation of the templeinland acquisition our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 25 billion of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

we expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2012 and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects the reduction of total debt including the company’s unfunded pension obligation returning value to shareholders including the funding of our previously announced dividend increases and strengthening our businesses through acquisitions as appropriate 

capital spending for 2012 is targeted at 15 billion or about 102 of depreciation and amortization including spending at the legacy templeinland facilities 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes see pages 45 through 48 for a discussion of the company’s critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates

corporate overview 

while the operating results for international paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of businessspecific factors changes in international paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america europe russia latin america asia and north africa factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and movements in currency exchange rates 

product prices are affected by general economic trends inventory levels currency movements and worldwide capacity utilization in addition to these revenuerelated factors net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs principally wood recycled fiber and chemical costs energy costs freight costs salary and benefits costs including pensions and manufacturing conversion costs 

the following is a discussion of international paper’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2010 and 2009

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america 

cash uses during 2011 were primarily focused on voluntary contributions to the company’s pension plan and higher capital spending as well as the appm acquisition in india 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 27 billion in 2011 compared with 16 billion for 2010 and 47 billion for 2009 

the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items increased by 11 billion in 2011 versus 2010 driven mainly by approximately 900 million less in pension contributions in 2011 cash used for working capital components accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 505 million in 2011 458 million in 2010 and a source of 479 million in 2009 

the company generated free cash flow of approximately 17 billion 17 billion and 22 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively free cash flow is a nongaap measure and the most comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets make investments or acquisitions pay dividends and reduce debt the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations 

 

 

 

  

 

 alternative fuel mixture credits 

the us internal revenue code provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses the credit equal to 050 per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture is refundable to the taxpayer in january 2009 the company received notification that its application to be registered as an alternative fuel mixer had been approved for the year ended december 31 2009 the company filed claims for alternative fuel mixture credits covering eligible periods subsequent to november 2008 through october 25 2009 totaling approximately 17 billion all of which had been received in cash at december 31 2009 additionally the company recorded 379 million of alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction of income taxes payable at december 31 2009 the company recorded these credits using the accrual method of accounting based on the estimated eligible volumes reflected in its filed claims accordingly the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes credits of approximately 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 in cost of products sold 14 billion after taxes representing eligible alternative fuel mixture credits earned through december 31 2009 when the credit expired 

cellulosic biofuel tax credit 

in a memorandum dated june 28 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor would also qualify for the cellulosic biofuel tax credit of 101 per gallon produced in 2009 on october 15 2010 the irs ruled 

that companies may qualify in the same year for both the 050 per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the 101 cellulosic biofuel tax credit for 2009 but not for the same gallons produced and consumed to the extent a taxpayer changes its position and elects the 101 credit it must repay the refunds received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic biofuel credit the repayment of this refund must include interest 

one important difference between the two credits is that the 101 credit must be credited against a company’s federal tax liability and the credit may be carried forward through 2015 in contrast the 050 credit was refundable in cash the cellulosic biofuel credit is required to be included in federal taxable income 

the company filed an application with the irs on november 18 2010 to receive the required registration code to become a registered cellulosic biofuel producer the company received this registration code on february 28 2011 

the company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009 considerations include uncertainty around future federal taxable income the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit future liquidity and uses of cash such as but not limited to acquisitions debt repayments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture credits with interest at the present time the company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic biofuel credit on july 19 2011 the company filed an amended 2009 tax return claiming alternative fuel mixture tax credits as nontaxable if that amended position is not upheld the company would reevaluate its position with regard to alternative fuel mixture gallons produced in 2009 

during 2009 the company produced 64 million gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit the company claimed these gallons for the cellulosic biofuel credit by amending the company’s 2009 tax return the impact of this amendment was included in the company’s 2010 income tax provision benefit resulting in a 40 million net credit to tax expense 

as is the case with other tax credits taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the irs which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed or credits received

activity between the company and the entities was as follows 

 

  

   based on an analysis of the entities discussed above under guidance that considers the potential magni 

 

  

tude of the variability in the structures and which party has a controlling financial interest international paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entities and therefore should not consolidate its investments in these entities it was also determined that the source of variability in the structure is the value of the timber notes the assets most significantly impacting the structure’s economic performance the credit quality of the timber notes is supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by third party buyers which are 100 cash collateralized international paper analyzed which party has control over the economic performance of each entity and concluded international paper does not have control over significant decisions surrounding the timber notes and letters of credit and therefore is not the primary beneficiary the company’s maximum exposure to loss equals the value of the timber notes however an analysis performed by the company concluded the likelihood of this exposure is remote 

international paper also held variable interests in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of forestlands in 2001 and 2002 international paper transferred notes the monetized notes with an original maturity of 10 years from inception and cash having a value of approximately 10 billion to these entities in exchange for preferred interests and accounted for the transfers as a sale of the notes with no associated gain or loss in the same period the entities acquired approximately 10 billion of international paper debt obligations for cash international paper has no obligation to make any further capital contributions to these entities and did not provide any financial support that was not previously contractually required during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 or 2009 

activity between the company and the 2001 financing entities was as follows 

 

  

  

the 2001 monetized notes of 499 million matured on march 16 2011 following their maturity international paper purchased the class a preferred interest in the 2001 financing entities from an external third party for 21 million as a result of the purchase effective march 16 2011 international paper owned 100 of the 2001 financing entities based on an analysis performed by the company after the purchase under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party has a controlling financial interest international paper determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the 2001 financing entities and thus consolidated the entities effective march 16 2011 

due to the maturity of the 2001 monetized notes and consolidation of the 2001 financing entities notes payable and current maturities of longterm debt decreased by 21 million in the first quarter of 2011 deferred tax liabilities associated with the 2001 forestlands sales decreased by 164 million effective april 30 2011 international paper liquidated its interest in the 2001 financing entities 

the company retained no interest in the 2001 financing entities at december 31 2011 but retained a preferred interest in the entities of 542 million at december 31 2010 which was offset against related debt obligations since international paper had and intended to effect a legal right of offset to netsettle these two amounts outstanding debt related to the 2001 financing entities of 2 million is included in shortterm notes and 19 million is included in floating rate notes due 20112017 in the summary of longterm debt in note 12 for 2010 

activity between the company and the 2002 financing entities was as follows 

 

  

   

 

  

on may 31 2011 the thirdparty equity holder of the 2002 financing entities retired its class a interest in the entities for 51 million as a result of the retirement effective may 31 2011 international paper owns 100 of the 2002 financing entities based on an analysis performed by the company after the retirement under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party has controlling financial interest international paper determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the 2002 financing entities and thus consolidated the entities effective may 31 2011 

due to the consolidation of the 2002 financing entities notes payable and current maturities of longterm debt increased 165 million and longterm debt decreased 211 million in addition investments decreased 486 million due to the elimination of the company’s variable interest in the 2002 financing entities while accounts and notes receivable net increased 441 million due to the consolidation of the 2002 monetized notes 

during the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 191 million of the 2002 monetized notes matured as a result of the maturities accounts and notes receivable net and notes payable and current maturities of longterm debt decreased 191 million and deferred tax liabilities associated with the 2002 forestlands sales decreased 50 million 

outstanding debt related to the 2002 financing entities of 2 million is included in shortterm notes in the summary of longterm debt in note 12 at december 31 2010 additional debt related to these entities of 158 million and 445 million is included in floating rate notes due 2011 to 2017 in the summary of longterm debt in note 12 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the company retained no investment interest in the 2002 financing entities at december 31 2011 but retained an interest of 486 million at december 31 2010 which is included in investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the 2002 monetized notes of 252 million are included in accounts and notes receivable net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 

the use of the above entities facilitated the monetization of the credit enhanced timber and monetized notes in a cost effective manner by increasing the borrowing capacity and lowering the interest rate while continuing to preserve the tax deferral that resulted from the forestlands installment sales and the offset accounting treatment described above 

see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of these transactions 

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2012 

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2012 through current cash balances and cash from operations additionally the company has existing credit facilities totaling 25 billion 

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2011 the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a total debttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss the total debttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2011 international paper’s net worth was 133 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 43 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2011 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa3 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

 

  

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

  

    we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2011 the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 920 million we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2011 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 24 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 20 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits 

the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make voluntary contributions totaling 300 million and 115 billion for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively at this time we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of december 31 2011 will require the company to make cash contributions to its plans in 2012 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture international paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time after the second anniversary of the formation of ilim either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions under certain circumstances the company would be required to purchase its partners’ 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement international paper estimates that the current purchase price for its partners’ 50 interests would be approximately 10 billion to 105 billion which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the company’s option any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement although they have the right to do so 

 

  

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pensions postretirement benefits other than pensions stock options and income taxes the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required 

annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of 

 

  

the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2011 2010 or 2009 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2011 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows 

 

 the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 

international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2012 pension expense by approximately 21 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 27 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 1 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 41 and 77 for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 2001 – 2011 

 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these 

 

  

net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately nine years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 303 million and 32 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the decrease in 2011 us pension expense principally reflects higher than expected asset returns in 2010 partially offset by a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 560 in 2011 from 580 in 2010 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2011 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

  

 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 315 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2012 with the increase from expense of 195 million in 2011 reflecting decreased plan assets in 2012 as a result of lower than expected asset returns in 2011 benefit payments offset by a 300 million voluntary contribution 

in 2011 and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 510 in 2012 from 560 in 2011 the post retirement plan was remeasured on january 31 2012 due to a negative plan amendment which reduced our obligation by 43 million in the first quarter of 2012 and reduced the 2012 expected benefit cost by 11 million 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2011 totaled approximately 82 billion consisting of approximately 43 equity securities 34 debt securities and 23 real estate and other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 19 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

accounting for stock options 

international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 156 million options and 182 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 3254 to 4312 per share for both 2011 and 2010 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for 

 

  

the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 21 27 and 39 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2011 was 32 of pretax earnings compared with 30 in 2010 and 30 in 2009 we estimate that the 2012 effective income tax rate will be approximately 3335 based on expected earnings and business conditions 

recent accounting developments 

there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial 

statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

legal proceedings 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 47 such sites and that its liability at each of the 44 other sites is likely to be significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements remedial costs are recorded in the financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 91 matters is approximately 98 million in the aggregate 

one of the 91 matters described above includes a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake minnesota during 2009 in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasibility study in june 2011 the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of 46 million as a result the company has adjusted the overall remediation reserve for the site to 51 million to address this recent selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy in october 2011 the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive cleanup alternative the remediation costs could be material and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded 

in addition to the above 91 matters other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company’s current closed or formerlyowned facilities and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled 

 

  

approximately 47 million other than as described below completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper incportage creekkalamazoo river superfund site kalamazoo river superfund site in michigan the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the river including a paper mill formerly owned by st regis the company is a successor in interest to st regis international paper has not received any orders from the epa with respect to the site and is in the process of collecting information from the epa and other parties relative to the kalamazoo river superfund site to evaluate the extent of its liability if any with respect to the site accordingly it is premature to estimate a loss or range of loss with respect to this site 

also in connection with the kalamazoo river superfund site the company was named as a defendant by georgia pacific consumers products lp fort james corporation and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the kalamazoo river superfund site the suit seeks contribution under cercla for 79 million in costs purportedly expended to date by plaintiffs and for future remediation costs the suit alleges that a mill during the time it was allegedly owned and operated by st regis discharged pcb contaminated solids and paper residuals resulting from paper deinking and recycling also named as defendants in the suit are ncr corporation and weyerhaeuser company in mid2011 the suit was transferred from the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin to the district court for the western district of michigan the company is involved in the early phases of discovery and believes it is premature to predict the outcome or to estimate the amount or range of loss if any which may be incurred 

international paper and mcginnis industrial maintenance corporation a subsidiary of waste management inc are potentially responsible parties at the san jacinto river superfund site in harris county texas and have been actively participating in investigation and remediation activities at this superfund site 

in december 2011 harris county texas filed a suit against the company in harris county district court seeking civil penalties with regard to the alleged 

discharge of dioxin into the san jacinto river since 1965 from the san jacinto river superfund site also named as defendants in this action are mcginnis industrial maintenance corporation waste management inc and waste management of texas inc harris county is seeking civil penalties pursuant to the texas water code which provides for the imposition of civil penalties between 50 and 25000 per day 

on april 8 2011 the united states district court for the northern district of illinois denied motions by the company and eight other us and canadian containerboard producers to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that these producers violated the sherman act by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of containerboard from mid2005 to the present plaintiffs in the lawsuit seek certification of a nationwide class of direct purchasers of containerboard products treble damages and costs including attorneys’ fees in january 2011 the company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in state court in cocke county tennessee alleging that the company and other containerboard producers violated tennessee law by conspiring to limit the supply and fix the prices of containerboard from mid2005 to the present plaintiffs in the lawsuit seek certification of a class of tennessee indirect purchasers of containerboard products damages and costs including attorneys’ fees the company believes the allegations in both lawsuits are without merit but both lawsuits are in preliminary stages and the costs and other effects of pending litigation cannot be reasonably estimated although we believe the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

the company is currently the beneficiary of a value added tax vat incentive issued by the brazilian state of mato grosso do sul on august 8 2011 the brazilian supreme court officially issued a decision judging unconstitutional several vat incentive programs that were enacted without the approval of the confederation of state vat authorities at this time it does not appear that the company’s incentive is affected by the decision the cumulative benefit recorded by the company through december 31 2011 was 45 million 

other legal matters 

the company is involved in various other inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters contracts sales of 

 

  

property intellectual property personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activ 

ities is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2011 and 2010 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2011 and 2010 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 105 billion and 85 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 505 million and 373 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2011 and 2010 was approximately 10 million and 29 million respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 2 million and 7 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

  

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2011 and 2010 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 

a 52 million liability and a 13 million asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 59 million and 37 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

evaluation of controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of december 31 2011 an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15 under the exchange act based upon this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2011 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  



  

  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit and finance committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 of this annual report under the heading “financial statements and supplementary data” deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the 

 

  

enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of four independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities

competition and costs 

despite the size of the company’s manufacturing capacity for paper packaging and pulp products the markets in all of the cited product lines are large and fragmented the major markets both us and nonus in which the company sells its principal products are very competitive our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies we also compete in some instances with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood and woodfiber products 

many factors influence the company’s competitive position including price cost product quality and services you can find more information about the impact of price and cost on operating profits on pages 18 through 33 of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you can find information about the company’s manufacturing capacities on page a4 of appendix ii

research and development 

the company operates its primary research and development center in loveland ohio as well as several product laboratories additionally the company has an interest in arborgen inc a joint venture with certain other forest products companies 

we direct research and development activities to shortterm longterm and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions and to process equipment and product innovations activities include studies on innovation and improvement of pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking and coating processes packaging design and materials development reduction of environmental discharges reuse of raw materials in manufacturing processes recycling of consumer and packaging paper products energy conservation applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations innovations and improvement of products and development of various new products our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste the cost to the company of its research and development operations was 12 million in 2010 13 million in 2009 and 22 million in 2008 the decrease in cost beginning in 2009 reflects cost cutting measures 

we own numerous patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and to the processes for their production we also license intellectual property rights to and from others where necessary many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets some of our products are covered by us and nonus patents and are sold under well known trademarks we derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights and by using them as required to support our businesses 

environmental protection 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives include 1 controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment and 2 maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 62 million was spent in 2010 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of 

waste we expect to spend approximately 90 million in 2011 for similar capital projects 

in the us the environmental protection agency epa proposed or finalized a number of new rules including greenhouse gas mandatory reporting see climate change section boiler mact see below and more restrictive national ambient air quality standards naaqss during 2010 new naaqss were promulgated for nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide so 2  and we anticipate that over the next 1218 months additional naaqss will also be promulgated once implemented these rules could require significant investments of capital andor operational changes that could potentially have a material impact on international paper 

in june 2010 the epa published four interrelated proposed rules commonly and collectively referred to as “boiler mact” as proposed these rules require owners of specified boilers to meet very strict air emission standards for certain substances the promulgation of these rules has been subject to litigation among various parties and the epa over a period of several years in late december 2010 the epa filed a motion with the us district court for the district of columbia to further extend the time to promulgate the boiler mact rules for an additional 15 months to take into account the voluminous amount of new data epa received in the comment period on january 20 2011 the court denied epa’s request and granted only one additional month until february 21 2011 to complete the rulemaking on that same day epa announced in a press release that it will issue rules by the courtimposed deadline but indicated that the rules “will be significantly different” than previously proposed given epa’s press release international paper cannot speculate on what the rules will require or their impact on the amount or timing of any related future capital expenditures the amount we will spend for environmental control projects in future years will also depend on other new laws and regulations and changes in rules that are likely to be promulgated such as naaqss 

recognizing these many uncertainties our forecasts include an estimate of future expenditures that may be required for boiler mact and other regulatory initiatives these amounts represent our current best estimate of future expenditures which we believe are likely to change once the regulatory landscape becomes clearer our preliminary estimate for environmental control expenditures is approximately 300 million for 2012 and approximately 350 million for 2013 when regulatory requirements regarding 

 

  

boiler mact become final including likely subsequent legal challenges the company’s environmental manufacturing and legal professionals will need time to assess fully the potential impacts on our company before we will be able to provide a more precise estimate of future environmental control expenditures 

climate change 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded with an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of international national and subnational regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations apply currently or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

while the european union eu has ratified the kyoto protocol the framework of the kyoto protocol does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” three countries where we have operations brazil morocco and china are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol although not subject to the kyoto protocol brazil and china may adopt greenhouse gas regulations in the future that may have a material effect on our operations in these countries unless extended the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 a successor to the kyoto protocol is under negotiation at the international level due to the lack of clarity around the post2012 climate control regime it is not possible at this time to estimate with any certainty the potential impacts of future international agreements on international paper’s operations 

under the european emissions trading system euets the eu has committed to greenhouse gas reductions international paper had two sites covered by the euets in 2010 while these measures did not have an adverse effect on our european operations in 2010 nor are they expected to have such an impact in 2011 they may have a material adverse effect in the future 

the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol nor have efforts in the us congress to legislate the control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions been successful to date the activity in the us has been spearheaded by the us epa and to some extent by the states pursuant to its ghg mandatory reporting 

rule promulgated in 2009 epa began a process to collect data on emitters of greater than 25000 tons of greenhouse gas per year twenty of our us facilities are covered by and will make reports as required under this new rule we do not believe that the reporting rule will have a material impact on our operations additionally the epa has indicated that it will propose new source performance standards nsps for various industry sectors which will limit ghg emissions from certain sources currently the epa has not identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards however we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources will be subject to new nsps rules it is uncertain what impacts if any future nsps will have on international paper’s operations 

some us states have considered legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs one such state is california where international paper has one site subject to california’s ghg regulatory plan the final california rules are still being developed and do not take effect until 2012 until the rules are finalized it is unknown whether there will be any adverse impact on our california facility 

it is difficult to predict whether passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various us states or the adoption of regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may have a material effect on our operations in the us in addition to possible direct impacts future legislation and regulation could have indirect adverse effects on international paper such as higher prices for transportation energy and other inputs as well as more protracted air permitting processes causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects 

international paper has controls and procedures in place to stay adequately informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the us and in other countries where we operate to ensure we continue to assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material adverse effect on the company its operations or financial condition and whether we have any related disclosure obligations 

 

  

in summary regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance 

additional information regarding climate change and international paper including our carbon footprint is available at httpinternationalpapercomusen companysustainabilityclimatehtml 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 59500 employees 36120 of whom were located in the united states of the us employees approximately 23460 are hourly with unions representing approximately 13920 employees approximately 10000 of the union employees are represented by the united steel workers usw 

international paper and the usw entered into the 2007 mill agreement in july 2007 which established the framework for bargaining future local labor contracts at 14 of our us pulp paper and packaging mills in november 2009 international paper and the usw reached an agreement to integrate into the 2007 mill agreement the four mills we acquired from weyerhaeuser company in august 2008 

in april 2008 we entered into the 2008 converting agreement which similarly establishes the framework for bargaining future local labor contracts at 32 of our converting facilities in march 2010 international paper and the usw reached an agreement to integrate into the 2008 converting agreement the 20 facilities we acquired from weyerhaeuser company in august 2008 

these two agreements the mill and converting agreements cover several specific items including but not limited to wages active medical benefits successorship employment security and health and safety if local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration then under the 2007 mill agreement and 2008 converting agreement the local facility agreements will automatically renew with the same terms in effect at the time of expiration individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other items not covered by these agreements 

during 2010 labor agreements for four mills expired three of the four port hueneme california red river louisiana and riegelwood north carolina are 

covered by the 2007 mill agreement local agreements at port hueneme and red river renewed with the same terms minor changes were negotiated at courtland alabama nonexempt union not covered by the 2007 mill agreement and riegelwood 

during 2011 labor agreements that are scheduled to expire at the mills in georgetown south carolina riverdale selma alabama and vicksburg mississippi will automatically renew under the terms of the 2007 mill agreement if new agreements are not reached

during 2011 20 labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated in 19 converting distribution and consumer packaging facilities seven of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the 2008 converting agreement if new agreements are not reached thirteen of these agreements are not covered by the 2008 converting agreement

raw materials essential to our businesses include wood fiber purchased in the form of pulpwood wood chips and old corrugated containers occ and certain chemicals including caustic soda and starch information concerning fiber supply purchase agreements that were entered into in connection with the company’s 2006 transformation plan is presented in note 10 commitments and contingent liabilities on page 71 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements factors 

 

  

which could cause actual results to differ relate to i increases in interest rates ii industry conditions including but not limited to changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation costs competition we face cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences demand and pricing for our products iii global economic conditions and political changes including but not limited to the impairment of financial institutions changes in currency exchange rates credit ratings issued by recognized credit rating organizations the amount of our future pension funding obligation changes in tax laws and pension and health care costs iv unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with existing and new environmental and other governmental regulations and to actual or potential litigation and v whether we experience a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities and risks inherent in conducting business through a joint venture we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 

our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments product or pricing strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the 

  

market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position similarly we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating if this were to happen it may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained 

the impairment of financial institutions may adversely affect us we have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions including us and foreign commercial banks insurance companies investment banks investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade bankruptcy liquidity default or similar risks especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil a ratings downgrade bankruptcy receivership default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital liquidity position future business and results of operations

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2010 was 15 billion the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures for additional information with respect to our ilim joint venture see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – liquidity and capital resources – ilim holding sa shareholders agreement on page 39

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper experienced a transition year in 2010 as we emerged from one of the worst recessions in decades to end the year with our highest fourthquarter earnings per share in over ten years the strong fourth quarter wrapped up a strong 2010 our earnings per share before special items were more than twice what they were in 2009 the levers for improvement during 2010 included higher price realizations volume recovery better operations and a significantly higher contribution from our ilim joint venture in russia the primary downside came from input costs where we saw pressure on virgin and recycled fiber costs however we were able to overcome these higher costs and expand our margins during 2010 we saw improvements across all of our segments and in each of our geographic regions 

the health of our balance sheet remains strong we generated free cash flow before dividends of approximately 17 billion see reconciliation on page 33 in spite of increased capital spending we also continued to reduce debt made voluntary contributions to our qualified us pension plan totaling 115 billion and increased our annual dividend from 010 to 075 through an increase early in 2010 and another in early 2011 

looking ahead we believe that we continue to operate in a recovering but not fully recovered economy therefore we expect 2011 to be a year of accelerating improvement for international paper the first quarter has traditionally been seasonally slow and we expect first quarter results to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 with stable volumes prices and operations offset by rising input costs we will also see a higher contribution from ilim during the first quarter which will represent their fourth quarter 2010 operations as they are reported on a onequarter lag as the global economy continues to recover we expect price realizations and volumes to improve throughout 2011 

earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders before special items is a nongaap measure diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company shareholders is the most direct comparable gaap measure the company calculates 

earnings per share before special items by excluding the aftertax effect of items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under gaap management uses this measure to focus on ongoing operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results the company believes that using this information along with the most direct comparable gaap measure provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations the following is a reconciliation of earnings per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders before special items to diluted earnings loss per share attributable to international paper company common shareholders 

 

 results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes equity earnings noncontrolling interests interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in five segments industrial packaging printing papers consumer packaging distribution and forest products 

 

  

the following table shows the reconciliation of industry segment operating profits to net earnings loss attributable to international paper company for each of the last three years 

 

  

  industry segment operating profits of 17 billion were 674 million lower in 2010 than in 2009 due principally to a 344 million net loss from special items in 2010 compared with an 898 million net gain in 2009 which included the impact of alternative fuel mixture credits operationally the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs 548 million higher distribution costs 95 million a bad debt provision for a large envelope company 17 million higher mill outages 47 million and other items 15 million were more than offset by higher average prices 798 million higher sales volumes 269 million improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 154 million and higher earnings from land and mineral sales 69 million 

the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows 

 

  

  



 

  

  

 corporate items net of 226 million of expense in 2010 were higher than the 181 million of expense in 2009 due primarily to higher pension expenses the increase in 2009 versus 103 million of expense in 2008 was due to higher pension expenses 

corporate special items including restructuring and other items impairments of goodwill gains on transformation plan forestland sales and net losses gains on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of 45 million in 2010 compared with a loss of 334 million in 2009 and a loss of 19 billion in 2008 the loss in 2008 includes 18 billion of goodwill impairment charges 

interest expense net was 608 million in 2010 compared with 669 million in 2009 and 492 million in 2008 the decrease in 2010 reflects the repayment of 31 billion of debt in 2009 the increase in 2009 reflects the issuance of approximately 60 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the cbpr business in 2008 and higher interest rates in 2009 due to refinancing actions taken to extend debt maturities 

the 2010 income tax provision of 221 million includes a 14 million tax expense for an incentive compensation deferred tax writeoff a 32 million tax expense for a medicare part d deferred tax writeoff and a 40 million net tax benefit related to cellulosic biofuel credits the 2009 income tax provision of 469 million includes a net 165 million provision related to 2009 special tax adjustment items the 2008 income tax provision of 162 million includes a net 11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items excluding the tax effect of all special items taxes as a percent of pretax earnings were 30 in both 2010 and 2009 compared with 315 in 2008 the higher income tax rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 13 million of net adjustments were recorded relating to postclosing adjustments and estimates associated with prior sales of discontinued businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2010 international paper generated 16 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 47 billion including 17 billion from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009 capital spending for 2010 totaled 775 million or 53 of depreciation and amortization expense cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled 152 million while net reductions of debt totaled 383 million our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 25 billion of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

we expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2011 and will continue our balanced use of cash through investments in capital projects the continued reduction of total debt including the company’s unfunded pension obligation returning value to shareholders including the funding of our previously announced dividend increases and strengthening our businesses through acquisitions as appropriate 

capital spending for 2011 is targeted at 12 to 13 billion or about 86 to 93 of depreciation and amortization 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes

industrial packaging results include the cbpr business acquired in the 2008 third quarter net sales for 2010 increased 11 to 98 billion compared with 89 billion in 2009 and 28 compared with 77 billion in 2008 operating profits were 9 higher in 2010 than in 2009 and more than double 2008 levels excluding alternative fuel mixture credits facility closure costs and costs associated with the cbpr integration operating profits in 2010 were 14 higher than in 2009 and 75 higher than in 2008 benefits from higher sales volumes and decreased 

lackoforder downtime 162 million the effects of higher sales price realizations 313 million favorable operating costs 40 million and lower other costs 22 million were partially offset by less favorable mix 40 million higher planned maintenance downtime costs 16 million and higher raw material and freight costs 375 million additionally operating profits in 2010 included plant closure costs of 19 million while operating profits in 2009 included a gain of 849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits us plant closure costs of 653 million integration costs associated with the acquisition of the cbpr business of 87 million and costs associated with the shutdown of the etienne mill in france of 87 million 

 

 north american industrial packaging results include the net sales and operating profits of the cbpr business since the august 4 2008 acquisition date net sales were 84 billion in 2010 compared with 76 billion in 2009 and 62 billion in 2008 operating profits in 2010 were 763 million 776 million excluding facility closure costs compared with 791 million 682 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits mill closure costs and costs associated with the cbpr integration in 2009 and 322 million 414 million excluding charges related to the writeup of the cbpr inventory to fair value cbpr integration costs and other facility closure costs in 2008 

sales volumes increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to stronger customer demand for boxes and for exported linerboard average sales price realizations were significantly higher reflecting the impact of 2010 announced price increases for domestic and exported containerboard average sales margins for boxes decreased as box sales price increases were outpaced by increases in the raw material cost of containerboard input costs were sharply higher primarily for recycled fiber but also for wood and energy while chemical costs decreased freight costs were also higher planned maintenance downtime costs increased from 2009 levels while operating costs were significantly lower reflecting the fixed cost savings from the closures of the albany oregon and pineville louisiana mills in the 2009 fourth quarter and the realization of cost reduction and synergy initiatives in the box plants lackoforder downtime in 2010 was about 130000 tons in addition to a capacity reduction of about 

 

  

15 million tons associated with the closures of the albany oregon and pineville louisiana mills and the idling of a paper machine at the valliant mill in december 2009 lackoforder downtime in 2009 was about 22 million tons including 450000 tons related to the idled paper machine at the valliant oklahoma mill and the december 2009 shutdowns of the albany oregon and pineville louisiana mills 

looking ahead to 2011 sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to remain at about fourth quarter levels although box volumes may be impacted by adverse weather conditions in the us average sales price realizations are expected to decrease reflecting a decline in exported linerboard sales prices while domestic linerboard sales prices should be about flat and box sales price realizations should show a modest increase input costs for purchased fiber are expected to be higher on average as firstquarter 2011 costs are expected to remain at the late fourthquarter 2010 level in addition wood and energy costs are expected to increase planned maintenance downtime costs should be higher with outages scheduled at three mills operating costs are expected to be favorable in both the containerboard and box businesses 

european industrial packaging net sales were 990 million in 2010 compared with 980 million in 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 operating profits in 2010 were 70 million 73 million before costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in france compared with a loss of 30 million a gain of 57 million excluding costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in france in 2009 and earnings of 64 million in 2008 sales volumes in 2010 were higher than in 2009 primarily reflecting improved demand for packaging in the industrial markets average sales margins decreased as box price increases only partially offset higher raw material costs for kraft and recycled containerboard other input costs were about the same in 2010 as in 2009 operating costs were favorable and the business benefitted from the operating cost savings associated with the closure of the etienne mill in france in november 2009 operating earnings included 3 million in 2010 and 87 million in 2009 for closure costs associated with the etienne france mill closure 

entering the first quarter of 2011 sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonally weaker demand for agricultural boxes than in the fourth quarter of 2010 average margins are expected to remain stable as box price increases are expected to partly offset containerboard cost increases in europe operating costs are expected to be favorable 

asian industrial packaging net sales for 2010 were 495 million compared with 325 million in 2009 and 350 million in 2008 operating earnings for the packaging operations were a loss of 7 million a loss of 4 million excluding facility closure costs in 2010 compared with earnings of 3 million in both 2009 and 2008 earnings in 2010 include the results of sca packaging asia since the acquisition on june 30 2010 including the impact of incremental integration expenses

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs and freight costs 

printing papers net sales for 2010 increased 5 from 2009 but decreased 13 from 2008 operating profits in 2010 were 56 lower than in 2009 but 1 higher than in 2008 however excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs operating profits in 2010 were 72 higher than in 2009 and 9 higher than in 2008 benefits from higher sales price realizations 365 million lower operating costs 126 million and improved mix 32 million were partially offset by the net impact of lower sales volumes 13 million higher raw material and freight costs 111 million higher planned mill maintenance downtime costs 18 million and higher other costs 49 million in addition operating profits in 2010 included 315 million of costs associated with the permanent shutdown of our franklin virginia mill while operating profits in 2009 included 884 million of alternative fuel mixture credits 223 million of shutdown costs for the franklin virginia mill and 34 million of other restructuring costs 

 



 

  

north american printing papers net sales in 2010 were 28 billion compared with 28 billion in 2009 and 34 billion in 2008 operating earnings in 2010 were 18 million 333 million excluding facility closure costs compared with 746 million 307 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs in 2009 and 405 million 435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine in 2008 

sales volumes decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to reduced production capacity related to the permanent closure of the franklin virginia mill in the second quarter of 2010 and wood supply constraints in the first quarter of 2010 average sales price realizations were higher reflecting the realization of price increases for uncoated freesheet paper announced in the first half of 2010 input costs for wood energy and purchased pulp were higher but were partially offset by lower costs for chemicals freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs and overall higher average miles per shipment following the closure of the franklin virginia mill operating costs were unfavorable due to higher depreciation expense related to increased production partially offset by cost savings associated with the closure of the franklin virginia mill planned maintenance downtime costs were also higher lackoforder downtime in 2010 was approximately 21000 tons compared with 405000 tons in 2009 in addition capacity was reduced by 450000 tons in 2010 due to the closure of the franklin virginia mill in april operating earnings included charges of 315 million in 2010 and 223 million in 2009 for costs associated with the closure of the franklin virginia mill operating earnings in 2009 also included 671 million of alternative fuel mixture credits and 9 million of other shutdown costs 

entering 2011 first quarter sales volumes are expected to increase reflecting seasonally stronger demand average sales price realizations are expected to be mostly stable input costs should continue to rise for energy and chemicals but wood costs should be about flat planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be lower in the 2011 firstquarter compared with the 2010 fourthquarter 

brazilian papers net sales for 2010 of 11 billion increased from 960 million in 2009 and 950 million in 2008 operating profits for 2010 were 159 million compared with 112 million in 2009 and 186 million in 2008 sales volumes in 2010 remained at about 2009 levels average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper increased significantly for shipments to brazilian export markets average sales 

price realizations for pulp were also higher reflecting stronger market demand as well as supply restrictions resulting from the chilean earthquake in the first quarter of 2010 margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales when the domestic brazilian market did not grow as anticipated raw material costs were lower for wood and chemicals but this benefit was offset by higher purchased pulp costs operating costs were lower in 2010 but planned maintenance downtime costs were higher 

entering 2011 sales volumes are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to seasonally weaker customer demand for uncoated freesheet paper profit margins are expected to be lower reflecting a less favorable geographic sales mix and lower sales price realizations in the brazilian domestic market input costs are expected to be slightly higher for chemicals but operating costs should be favorable 

european papers net sales in 2010 were 13 billion compared with 13 billion in 2009 and 17 billion in 2008 operating profits in 2010 were 197 million 199 million excluding an asset impairment charge associated with the inverurie scotland mill compared with 92 million 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie scotland mill in 2009 and 39 million 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets at the inverurie scotland mill to their estimated realizable value in 2008 

sales volumes in 2010 were slightly lower than in 2009 largely due to the closure of the inverurie scotland mill in 2009 average sales price realizations for uncoated freesheet paper increased due to improved market conditions and market pulp prices were significantly higher due to strong demand as well as supply restrictions resulting from the chilean earthquake in the first quarter of 2010 manufacturing operating costs were favorable due to excellent mill performance and operating efficiencies planned maintenance downtime costs were slightly lower input costs were higher for wood energy and purchased pulp but were lower for chemicals operating profits in 2010 reflect unfavorable foreign exchange impacts 

looking ahead to 2011 sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be slightly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to seasonally weaker demand for uncoated freesheet paper in russian markets partially offset by increased demand for uncoated freesheet paper in europe average sales 

 

  

price realizations should be higher due to increased prices for board and newsprint in europe input costs are expected to be higher for wood energy and chemicals planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower with no outages planned for the first quarter of 2011 and operating costs are expected to be favorable 

asian printing papers net sales were 80 million in 2010 compared with 50 million in 2009 and 20 million in 2008 operating earnings were less than 1 million in all periods

sales volumes in 2010 increased from 2009 levels average sales price realizations were significantly higher reflecting the impact of stronger market demand coupled with supply constraints in the first half of the year due to the chilean earthquake average margins improved reflecting an increase in shipments of highermargin fluff pulp input costs increased for wood and energy but were partially offset by lower chemical costs freight costs increased due to higher fuel costs mill operating costs were favorable but planned maintenance downtime costs were higher lackoforder downtime decreased in 2010 to an immaterial amount compared with 58000 tons in 2009 

in the first quarter of 2011 sales volumes are expected to be about flat average sales price realizations are expected to decrease reflecting competitive pressure on paper and tissue pulp prices input costs should be about flat planned maintenance downtime costs will be higher with outages planned during the first quarter of 2011 at two mills compared with none in the fourth quarter of 2010 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix

equity earnings net of taxes – ilim holding sa 

on october 5 2007 international paper and ilim holding sa “ilim” announced the completion of a 5050 joint venture to operate in russia due to the complex structure of ilim’s operations and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the company reports its share of ilim’s operating results on a onequarter lag basis accordingly the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 includes the company’s 50 share of ilim’s operating results for the period from october 1 2009 through september 30 2010 together with the results of other small equity investments under the caption equity earnings net of taxes ilim is reported as a separate reportable industry segment

for ilim’s 2010 fourth quarter which will be reported in the company’s 2011 first quarter market demand is expected to steadily improve throughout the quarter average sales price realizations are expected to increase for linerboard while softwood and hardwood pulp prices remain steady input costs for wood will be seasonally higher and fuel costs are also expected to increase operating costs are expected to be favorable but the foreign exchange impact is expected to be unfavorable 

a key element of the proposed joint venture strategy is a longterm investment program in which the joint venture will invest through cash from operations and additional borrowings by the joint venture approximately 15 billion in ilim’s three mills over approximately five years this planned investment in the russian pulp and paper industry will be used to upgrade equipment increase production capacity and allow for new highvalue coated and uncoated paper pulp and corrugated packaging product development this capital expansion strategy was initiated in the second quarter of 2010 with the announcement of a 670 million project to build a 

 

  

new pulp line at ilim’s bratsk mill in siberia followed in june by the announcement of a 270 million project to install a new coated and uncoated woodfree paper machine at the koryazhma mill these projects are being financed through additional borrowings by the joint venture and cash flow from operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america 

cash uses during 2010 were primarily focused on voluntary contributions to the company’s pension plan and higher capital spending 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 16 billion in 2010 compared with 47 billion for 2009 and 27 billion for 2008 

the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items decreased by 21 billion in 2010 versus 2009 driven mainly by 17 billion of cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009 cash used for working capital components accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities interest payable and other totaled 458 million in 2010 down from a source of 479 million in 2009 and a source of 317 million in 2008 the use of cash in 2010 primarily related to higher accounts receivable balances due to an increase in sales and higher inventory levels at yearend in anticipation of mill outages in the 2011 first quarter 

the company generated free cash flow of approximately 17 billion 22 billion and 17 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively free cash flow is a 

nongaap measure and the most comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations management uses free cash flow as a liquidity metric because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to maintain our assets make investments or acquisitions pay dividends and reduce debt the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operations 

 

 alternative fuel mixture credits 

the us internal revenue code provided a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses the credit equal to 050 per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture is refundable to the taxpayer in january 2009 the company received notification that its application to be registered as an alternative fuel mixer had been approved for the year ended december 31 2009 the company filed claims for alternative fuel mixture credits covering eligible periods subsequent to november 2008 through october 25 2009 totaling approximately 17 billion all of which had been received in cash at december 31 2009 additionally the company recorded 379 million of alternative fuel mixture credits as a reduction of income taxes payable at december 31 2009 the company recorded these credits using the accrual method of accounting based on the estimated eligible volumes reflected in its filed claims accordingly the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes credits of approximately 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 in cost of products sold 14 billion after taxes representing eligible alternative fuel mixture credits earned through december 31 2009 when the credit expired 

cellulosic biofuel tax credit 

in a memorandum dated june 28 2010 the irs concluded that black liquor would also qualify for the cellulosic biofuel tax credit of 101 per gallon produced in 2009 on october 15 2010 the irs ruled 

 

  

that companies may qualify in the same year for the 050 per gallon alternative fuel mixture credit and the 101 cellulosic biofuel tax credit for 2009 but not for the same gallons to the extent a taxpayer changes their position and uses the 101 credit they must repay the refunds they received as alternative fuel mixture credits attributable to the gallons converted to the cellulosic biofuel credit the repayment of this refund must include interest 

one important difference between the two credits is that the 101 credit must be credited against a company’s federal taxable earnings and the credit may be carried forward against taxable earnings through 2015 in contrast the 050 credit was refundable in cash the cellulosic biofuel credit is required to be included in federal taxable income 

the company filed an application with the irs on november 18 2010 to receive the required registration code to become a registered cellulosic biofuel producer at present the company has not received this registration code however the company believes approval of the application for the registration code to be ministerial in nature 

the company has evaluated the optimal use of the two credits with respect to gallons produced in 2009 considerations include uncertainty around future federal taxable income the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credit future liquidity and uses of cash such as but not limited to debt repayments and voluntary pension contributions versus repayment of alternative fuel mixture credits with interest at the present time the company does not intend to convert any gallons under the alternative fuel mixture credit to gallons under the cellulosic biofuel credit the company will continue evaluating its position with regard to the previously claimed alternative fuel mixture credit gallons produced in 2009 this continued evaluation may result in the company repaying some or all of the cash received with respect to the 050 credit and amendment of the company’s 2009 tax return due to the aforementioned considerations the company cannot quantify the value of additional cellulosic biofuel credits but it could be significant 

during 2009 the company did produce 64 million gallons of black liquor that were not eligible for the alternative fuel mixture credit the company does intend to claim these gallons for the cellulosic biofuel credit by amending the company’s 2009 tax return the impact of this amendment is a net 40 million credit to income tax provision benefit for 2010 

as is the case with other tax credits taxpayer claims are subject to possible future review by the irs which has the authority to propose adjustments to the amounts claimed or credits received

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2011 

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2011 through current cash balances and cash from operations additionally the company has existing credit facilities totalling 25 billion 

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2010 the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a totaldebttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss the totaldebttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2010 international paper’s net worth was 124 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 412 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

in february 2011 the company entered into various fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of approximately 100 million to hedge existing debt the interest rate swaps were effective february 2011 and mature within the next three to four years these interest rate swaps were designated as fully effective fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2010 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa3 stable outlook by sp and moody’s respectively 

 

  

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

  

    pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2010 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us gaap was approximately 15 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 11 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make 

voluntary contributions totaling 115 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 at this time we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of december 31 2010 will require the company to make cash contributions to its plans in 2011 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates 

ilim holding sa shareholder’s agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture ilim international paper entered into a shareholders’ agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time after the second anniversary of the formation of ilim either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions under certain circumstances the company would be required to purchase its partners’ 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement international paper estimates that the current purchase price for its partners’ 50 interests would be approximately 550 million to 600 million which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the company’s option any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement although they have the right to do so 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that 

 

  

affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pensions postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities 

accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various 

assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes 

international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

goodwill impairment analysis 

under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles – goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized 

 

  

intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

during 2008 as in prior years the company performed the required annual goodwill testing for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter resulting in a 59 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill for the company’s european coated paperboard business subsequent to this testing date the company performed an interim test as of december 31 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow projections and higher costofcapital discount rates based on this testing step two testing for possible impairment was required for the company’s us printing papers business and its us coated paperboard business based on management’s preliminary estimates an additional goodwill impairment charge of 379 million was recorded representing all of the goodwill for the us coated paperboard business as this was management’s best estimate of the minimum impairment charge that would be required upon the completion of detailed step two analyses in febru 

ary 2009 based on additional work performed to date management determined that it was probable that all of the 13 billion of recorded goodwill for the us printing papers business would be impaired when testing was completed accordingly an additional goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized the testing for these businesses resulting in no changes to the recorded impairment charges 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2010 or 2009 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting 

the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2010 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans were as follows 

 

 the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 



 

  

international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio the discount rate assumption was determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash flows were then matched to the yield curve to develop the discount rate 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2011 pension expense by approximately 22 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 29 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 1 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 65 and 72 for the past five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 20002010 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation 

due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately nine years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 204 million and 31 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the increase in 2010 us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 580 in 2010 from 600 in 2009 and higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2010 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

  



 

  

the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 179 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2011 with the decrease from expense of 231 million in 2010 reflecting increased plan assets in 2011 as a result of a 115 billion voluntary contribution and higher than expected asset returns in 2010 partially offset by a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 560 in 2011 from 580 in 2010 net postretirement benefit costs in 2011 are projected to increase primarily as a result of a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 530 in 2011 from 540 in 2010 partially offset by a decrease in per capita healthcare costs due to changes in plan provisions 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2010 totaled approximately 83 billion consisting of approximately 49 equity securities 31 debt securities and 20 real estate and other assets plan assets include an immaterial amount of international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 37 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

accounting for stock options 

international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 182 million options and 222 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 3254 to 4312 per share for 2010 and 2931 to 6669 per share for 2009 

income taxes 

the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 27 39 and 14 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2010 was 30 of pretax earnings compared with 30 in 2009 and 315 in 2008 the higher rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2011 effective income tax rate will be approximately 3234 based on expected earnings and business conditions

legal proceedings 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 54 such sites and that its liability at 45 other sites is likely to be significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements remedial costs are recorded in the financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 99 matters is approximately 76 million 

one of the sites referred to above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake minnesota during 2009 in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla we submitted to the epa a site remediation feasibility study in november 2010 the epa provided comments that limited the number of acceptable remedial action alternatives that the company may be allowed to pursue and adopted more restrictive clean up requirements for the site as a result the company 

 

  

increased its remediation reserve for this site from 6 million to 24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 the final remediation plan for this site has not been approved by the epa and of the five alternatives the company’s reserve reflects the low end of the range of estimated remediation costs since at this time no one of the alternatives proposed by the epa is any more likely than the others to be approved if the most expensive of the cleanup alternatives were approved by the epa the remediation costs could be material and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company’s current closed or formerlyowned facilities and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 48 million other than as described above completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

other legal matters 

the company is also involved in various other inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters contracts sales of property intellectual property personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened or all of them combined other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other 

regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2010 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

 

  

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 85 billion and 77 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 373 million and 394 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2010 and 2009 was approximately 29 million and 26 million respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 7 million and 20 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 13 million and 32 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 37 million and 73 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting internal controls over financial reporting is the process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  



  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2010 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on pages 48 and 49 management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit and finance committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and 

 

  

control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of five independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

during the 2010 second quarter the company acquired sca packaging asia integration activities including a preliminary assessment of internal controls over financial reporting are currently in process the initial annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for sca packaging asia will be conducted over the course of our 2011 assessment cycle 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following 

are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

  

risks relating to market and economic factors 

continued adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operation general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position similarly we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating if this were to happen it may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained 

the impairment of financial institutions may adversely affect us we have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions including us and foreign commercial banks insurance companies investment banks investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade bankruptcy liquidity default or similar risks especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil a ratings downgrade bankruptcy receivership default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital liquidity position future business and results of operations 

  

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business as of december 31 2009 we had 90 billion of longterm debt including notes payable and current maturities and the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our debt or are unable to refinance our debt because credit market conditions become volatile this may have an adverse impact on our cost of borrowing liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2009 was 28 billion although we expect to have no obligation to fund our plans in 2010 we continually reassess the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make such a contribution in 2010 regardless of whether we make a discretionary contribution in 2010 over the next several years we will make contributions to the plans that are likely to be material the amount of such contributions will depend upon 

  

a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the impact of possible funding relief legislation currently under consideration in the us congress 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety there can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs 

  

results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results 

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures for additional information with respect to our ilim joint venture see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – liquidity and capital resources – ilim holding sa shareholders agreement” on page 37

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper company reported net sales of 234 billion in 2009 compared with 248 billion in 2008 and 219 billion in 2007 net earnings totaled 663 million in 2009 including 14 billion of alternative fuel mixture credits and 853 million of charges to restructure ongoing businesses compared with a loss of 13 billion in 2008 which included a 18 billion goodwill impairment charge net earnings in 2007 totaled 12 billion 

the company performed well in 2009 considering the magnitude of the challenges it faced both domestically and around the world despite weak global economic conditions the company generated record cash flow from operations enabling us to reduce longterm debt by 31 billion while increasing cash balances by approximately 800 million also during 2009 the company incurred 36 million tons of downtime including 11 million tons associated with the shutdown of production capacity in our north american mill system to continue to match our production to our customers’ needs these actions should result in higher operating rates lower fixed costs and lower payroll costs in 2010 and beyond furthermore the realization of integration synergies in our us industrial packaging business and overhead reduction initiatives across the company position international paper to benefit from a lower cost profile in future years 

as 2010 begins we expect that firstquarter operations will continue to be challenging in addition to being a seasonally slow quarter for many of our businesses poor harvesting weather conditions in the us south and increasing competition for limited supplies of recycled fiber are expected to lead to further increases in fiber costs for our us mills planned maintenance outage expenses will also be higher than in the 2009 fourth quarter however we have announced product price increases for our major global manufacturing businesses and while these actions may not have a significant effect on firstquarter results we believe that the benefits beginning in the second quarter will be significant additionally we expect to benefit from the capacity management cost reduction and integration synergy actions taken during 2009 as a result the company remains positive about projected operating results in 2010 with improved earnings versus 2009 expected 

in all major businesses we will continue to focus on aggressive cost management and strong cash flow generation as 2010 progresses

 corporate items net of 181 million of expense in 2009 were higher than the 103 million of expense in 2008 due to higher pension expenses the decrease in 2008 versus 206 million of expense in 2007 reflects lower pension expenses

interest expense net was 669 million in 2009 compared with 492 million in 2008 and 297 million in 2007 the increases in 2009 and 2008 reflect the issuance of approximately 60 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the cbpr business in 2008 and higher interest rates in 2009 due to refinancing actions taken to extend debt maturities 

the 2009 income tax provision of 469 million includes a net 165 million provision related to 2009 special tax adjustment items the 2008 income tax provision of 162 million includes a net 11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items the 2007 income tax provision of 415 million includes a 41 million benefit related to 2007 special tax adjustment items excluding the tax effect of all special items taxes as a percent of pretax earnings were 30 in 2009 compared with 315 in 2008 and 30 in 2007 the higher income tax rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions

exchange for the luiz antonio mill in brazil see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in net losses gains on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

industry segment operating profits 

industry segment operating profits of 24 billion in 2009 increased from both 14 billion in 2008 and 19 billion in 2007 reflecting a 898 million net gain from special items in 2009 versus a 382 million net loss in 2008 the benefits of lower energy and raw material costs 447 million lower distribution costs 142 million favorable manufacturing operating costs 481 million incremental earnings from the cbpr business acquired in the third quarter of 2008 202 million and other items 35 million were offset by lower average sales price realizations 444 million lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 684 million unfavorable mix of products sold 109 million and lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales 383 million 

lackoforder downtime in 2009 increased to approximately 36 million tons compared with approximately one million tons in 2008 and 50000 tons in 2007 the 2009 total includes approximately 400000 tons associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at our valliant mill in 2009 and 50000 tons associated with the permanent shutdown of our pineville and albany mills at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 in addition approximately 600000 tons are included in the 2009 total and 105000 tons are included in the 2008 total associated with the permanent shutdown of our bastrop mill and the shutdown of an uncoated paper machine at our franklin mill in the fourth quarter of 2008 

looking ahead to the 2010 first quarter operating conditions in january and february are expected to be difficult the first quarter is typically a seasonally slow period and we anticipate only modest us economic recovery input cost inflation experienced in the 2009 fourth quarter is expected to continue reflecting poor wood harvesting conditions in the us south due to unusually cold and wet weather and strong global competition for recycled fiber primarily due to a reduction in supply for recycled fiber caused by the global recession in 2009 demand for north american paper and packaging should improve slightly while slight seasonal decreases are expected in other global markets pulp prices are expected to continue to improve and we expect to realize previously announced price 

  

increases on paper and packaging grades as the first quarter progresses planned maintenance outage costs in the united states are expected to increase while remaining about flat in europe and brazil earnings from our xpedx distribution business will reflect seasonally lower shipments and the absence of a favorable inventory valuation adjustment in the 2009 fourth quarter equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to decrease reflecting higher input costs an extended mill outage and foreign exchange losses

industry segment results 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production as well as with demand for processed foods 

poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging results for 2009 and 2008 include the cbpr business acquired in the 2008 third quarter net sales for 2009 increased 16 to 89 billion compared with 77 billion in 2008 and 69 compared with 52 billion in 2007 operating profits were 95 higher in 2009 than in 2008 and more than double 2007 levels benefits from higher total yearoveryear shipments including the impact of the cbpr business 11 million favorable operating costs 294 million and lower raw material and freight costs 295 million were partially offset by the effects of lower price realizations 243 million higher corporate overhead allocations 85 million incremental integration costs associated with the acquisition of the cbpr business 3 million and higher other costs 7 million additionally operating profits in 2009 included a gain of 849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits us plant closure costs of 653 million and costs associated with the shutdown of the etienne mill in france of 87 million 

 

 north american industrial packaging results include the net sales and operating profits of the cbpr business from the august 4 2008 acquisition date net sales were 76 billion in 2009 compared with 62 billion in 2008 and 39 billion in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were 791 million 682 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits mill closure costs and costs associated with the cbpr integration compared with 322 million 414 million excluding charges related to the writeup of cbpr inventory to fair value cbpr integration costs and other facility closure costs in 2008 and 305 million in 2007 

excluding the effect of the cbpr acquisition containerboard and box shipments were lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weaker customer demand average sales price realizations were significantly lower for both containerboard and boxes due to weaker worldwide economic conditions however average sales margins for boxes 

  

increased reflecting a slower decline in box prices than in the raw material cost of containerboard and cbpr integration benefits fullyear input costs for wood energy and chemicals were lower although costs for fiber and energy increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2009 freight costs were also lower planned maintenance downtime costs decreased slightly from 2008 levels and operating costs were significantly lower particularly in the box plants reflecting benefits from cost control initiatives lackoforder downtime totaled 22 million tons including approximately 450000 tons related to the idled paper machine at the valliant oklahoma mill and the late december shutdowns of the albany oregon and pineville louisiana mills in 2009 compared with 700000 tons in 2008 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2010 sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009 and average sales price realizations are expected to improve by the end of the quarter reflecting the impact of previously announced price increases for containerboard however input costs are expected to be significantly higher for energy as well as for wood and recycled fiber due to poor harvesting weather conditions in the us south and strong competition for recycled fiber planned maintenance downtime costs will also be higher with outages scheduled at five mills manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower reflecting benefits of the mill closures in december and improved operations 

european industrial packaging net sales for 2009 were 980 million compared with 12 billion in 2008 and 11 billion in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were a loss of 30 million a gain of 57 million excluding costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in france compared with earnings of 64 million in 2008 and 67 million in 2007 sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 principally reflecting weak customer demand for industrial packaging containers throughout the region sales margins improved as reductions in kraft and recycled containerboard costs were greater than declines in box prices input costs were favorable primarily for energy but operating costs were unfavorable the operating loss in 2009 includes 87 million of costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in november 2009 

entering the first quarter of 2010 sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonally weaker demand for agricultural boxes and continued weak demand for industrial packaging boxes average sales price realizations for boxes are expected to 

improve but costs for containerboard are expected to increase 

asian industrial packaging net sales for 2009 were 325 million compared with 350 million in 2008 and 265 million in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were about breakeven earnings of 2 million excluding the impairment of an investment in a joint venture compared with profits of 4 million in 2008 and 2 million in 2007 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs and freight costs 

printing papers net sales for 2009 decreased 17 from 2008 and 13 from 2007 operating profits in 2009 were more than double profits in 2008 and 30 higher than in 2007 however excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs operating profits in 2009 were 37 lower than in 2008 and 45 lower than in 2007 benefits from improved manufacturing operations 144 million lower raw material and energy costs 130 million lower freight costs 61 million favorable foreign exchange impacts 22 million and other items 11 million were more than offset by lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 215 million lower average sales price realizations 341 million and an unfavorable mix of products sold 82 million operating profits in 2009 included 884 million of alternative fuel mixture credits 223 million of costs associated with the permanent shutdown of our franklin mill and 34 million of other restructuring costs while 2008 operating profits included a charge of 123 million for costs associated with the permanent shutdown of our bastrop mill a 107 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at our inverurie scotland mill and 30 million of costs associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill the printing papers segment took 14 million tons of downtime in 2009 including 11 million tons of lackoforder downtime of which approximately 600000 tons were related to the shutdowns of our bastrop mill and a paper machine at our franklin 

  

mill in the fourth quarter of 2008 this compares with 635000 tons of total downtime in 2008 of which 305000 tons were lackoforder downtime 

 

 north american printing papers net sales in 2009 were 28 billion compared with 34 billion in 2008 and 35 billion in 2007 operating earnings in 2009 were 746 million 307 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs compared with 405 million 435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine in 2008 and 415 million in 2007 sales volumes decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lowermargin export markets input costs however were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and significantly lower energy costs freight costs were also lower planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 operating costs were favorable reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance lackoforder downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter from 135000 tons in 2008 operating earnings in 2009 included 671 million of alternative fuel mixture credits 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and 9 million of other shutdown costs while operating earnings in 2008 included 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill 

looking ahead to 2010 firstquarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourthquarter 2009 levels average sales price realizations should be higher reflecting the fullquarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated freesheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets however input costs for wood energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable 

  

brazilian papers net sales for 2009 of 960 million increased from 950 million in 2008 and 850 million in 2007 operating profits for 2009 were 112 million compared with 186 million in 2008 and 174 million in 2007 sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflecting higher export shipments average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales input costs for wood and chemicals were favorable but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs planned maintenance downtime costs were lower and operating costs were also favorable earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects 

entering 2010 sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage costs 

european papers net sales in 2009 were 13 billion compared with 17 billion in 2008 and 15 billion in 2007 operating profits in 2009 of 92 million 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill compared with 39 million 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie scotland mill to their estimated realizable value in 2008 and 171 million in 2007 sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations input costs were favorable as lower wood costs particularly in russia were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs planned maintenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 while manufacturing operating costs were lower operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts 

looking ahead to 2010 sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourthquarter levels despite solid customer demand average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quarter primarily in eastern europe as price increases 

  

for uncoated freesheet paper and market pulp announced at the end of 2009 become effective input costs are expected to be higher due to wood supply constraints at the kwidzyn mill and annual tariff increases on energy in russia planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be about flat while operating costs should be favorable 

asian printing papers net sales were approximately 50 million in 2009 compared with approximately 20 million in both 2008 and 2007 operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 compared with 2008 but were less than 1 million in all periods 

us market pulp net sales in 2009 totaled 575 million compared with 750 million in 2008 and 655 million in 2007 operating earnings in 2009 were 140 million a loss of 71 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs compared with a loss of 156 million a loss of 33 million excluding costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the bastrop mill in 2008 and earnings of 78 million in 2007 

sales volumes in 2009 decreased from 2008 levels due to weaker global demand average sales price realizations were significantly lower as the decline in demand resulted in significant price declines for market pulp and smaller declines in fluff pulp input costs for wood energy and chemicals decreased and freight costs were significantly lower mill operating costs were favorable across all mills and planned maintenance downtime costs were lower lackoforder downtime in 2009 increased to approximately 540000 tons including 480000 tons related to the permanent shutdown of our bastrop mill in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 135000 tons in 2008 

in the first quarter of 2010 sales volumes are expected to increase slightly reflecting improving customer demand for fluff pulp offset by slightly seasonally weaker demand for softwood and hardwood pulp in china average sales price realizations are expected to improve reflecting the realization of previously announced sales price increases for fluff pulp hardwood pulp and softwood pulp input costs are expected to increase for wood energy and chemicals and freight costs may also increase planned maintenance downtime costs will be higher but operating costs should be about flat 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and 

volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

consumer packaging net sales in 2009 decreased 4 compared with 2008 and increased 1 compared with 2007 operating profits increased significantly compared with both 2008 and 2007 excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs 2009 operating profits were significantly higher than 2008 and 57 higher than 2007 benefits from higher average sales price realizations 114 million lower raw material and energy costs 114 million lower freight costs 21 million lower costs associated with the reorganization of the shorewood business 23 million favorable foreign exchange effects 14 million and other items 12 million were partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 145 million and costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the franklin mill 67 million additionally operating profits in 2009 included 330 million of alternative fuel mixture credits 

 

 north american consumer packaging net sales were 22 billion compared with 25 billion in 2008 and 24 billion in 2007 operating earnings in 2009 were 343 million 87 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs compared with 8 million 38 million excluding facility closure costs in 2008 and 70 million in 2007 

coated paperboard sales volumes were lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weaker market conditions average sales price realizations were significantly higher reflecting the fullyear realization of price increases implemented in the second half of 2008 raw material costs for wood energy and chemicals were significantly lower in 2009 while freight costs were also favorable operating costs however were unfavorable and planned maintenance downtime costs were higher lackoforder downtime increased to 300000 tons in 2009 from 15000 tons in 2008 due to weak demand operating results in 2009 include income of 330 million for alternative fuel mixture credits and 67 million of expenses for shutdown costs for the franklin mill 

foodservice sales volumes were lower in 2009 than in 2008 due to generally weak worldwide economic conditions average sales price realizations were 

  

higher in the first half of the year but declined during the second half of the year reflecting the passthrough to customers of lower resin input costs however average margins benefitted from a more favorable mix of products sold raw material costs were lower primarily for resins freight costs were also favorable while operating costs increased 

shorewood sales volumes in 2009 declined from 2008 levels reflecting weaker demand in the home entertainment segment and a decrease in tobacco segment orders as customers have shifted production outside of the united states partially offset by higher shipments in the consumer products segment average sales margins improved reflecting a more favorable mix of products sold raw material costs were higher but were partially offset by lower freight costs operating costs were favorable reflecting benefits from business reorganization and cost reduction actions taken in 2008 and 2009 charges to restructure operations totaled 7 million in 2009 and 30 million in 2008 

entering 2010 coated paperboard sales volumes are expected to increase while average sales price realizations should be comparable to 2009 fourthquarter levels raw material costs are expected to be significantly higher for wood energy and chemicals but planned maintenance downtime costs will decrease foodservice sales volumes are expected to remain about flat but average sales price realizations should improve slightly input costs for resins should be higher but will be partially offset by lower costs for bleached board shorewood sales volumes are expected to decline reflecting seasonal decreases in home entertainment segment shipments operating costs are expected to be favorable reflecting the benefits of business reorganization efforts 

european consumer packaging net sales in 2009 were 315 million compared with 300 million in 2008 and 280 million in 2007 operating earnings in 2009 of 66 million increased from 22 million in 2008 and 30 million in 2007 sales volumes in 2009 were higher than in 2008 reflecting increased shipments to export markets average sales margins declined due to increased shipments to lowermargin export markets and lower average sales prices in western europe 

entering 2010 sales volumes for the first quarter are expected to remain strong average margins should improve reflecting increased sales price realizations and a more favorable geographic mix of products sold input costs are expected to be higher due to increased wood prices in poland and annual energy tariff increases in russia 

  

asian consumer packaging net sales were 545 million in 2009 compared with 390 million in 2008 and 330 million in 2007 operating earnings in 2009 were 24 million compared with a loss of 13 million in 2008 and earnings of 12 million in 2007 the improved operating earnings in 2009 reflect increased sales volumes higher average sales margins and lower input costs primarily for chemicals the loss in 2008 was primarily due to a 12 million charge to revalue pulp inventories at our shandong international paper and sun coated paperboard co ltd joint venture and startup costs associated with the joint venture’s new folding box board paper machine 

distribution 

xpedx  our distribution business markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in many business segments customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions although the commercial printing segment is also dependent on consumer advertising and promotional spending distribution’s margins are relatively stable across an economic cycle providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor additionally efficient customer service costeffective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america 

financing activities in 2009 focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt by 31 billion and refinancing 28 billion in longterm debt 

  

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 47 billion in 2009 compared with 27 billion for 2008 and 19 billion for 2007 

the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items increased by 18 billion in 2009 versus 2008 driven mainly by 17 billion of cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits this compares with a decrease of 135 million for 2008 versus 2007 changes in working capital components accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities contributed 479 million of cash in 2009 compared to 317 million of cash contributed in 2008 and a 539 million use of cash in 2007 included in the 2009 changes in working capital is 211 million of cash from the sale of accounts receivable in europe

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

  

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2009 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb negative outlook and baa3 negative outlook and shortterm credit ratings of a3 and p3 by sp and moody’s respectively

  pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2009 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us generally accepted accounting principles was approximately 28 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 24 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level at this time we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of december 31 2009 will require the company to make cash contributions to its plans in 2010 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the possible impact of funding relief proposals that may be adopted by the us congress 

ilim holding sa shareholders’ agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture ilim international paper entered into a shareholders’ agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time after the second anniversary of the formation of ilim either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions under certain circumstances the company would be required to purchase its partners’ 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement international paper estimates that the current purchase 

price for its partners’ 50 interests would be approximately 350 million to 400 million which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the company’s option any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement although they have the right to do so and they are no longer discussing a deferral of the timeframe to commence those procedures 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pensions postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations 

  

and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

  

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

goodwill impairment analysis under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles–goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operat  

  

ing conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

during 2008 as in prior years the company performed the required annual goodwill testing for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter resulting in a 59 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill for the company’s european coated paperboard business subsequent to this testing date the company performed an interim test as of december 31 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow projections and higher costofcapital discount rates based on this testing step two testing for possible impairment was required for the company’s us printing papers business and its us coated paperboard business based on management’s preliminary estimates an additional goodwill impairment charge of 379 million was recorded representing all of the goodwill for the us coated paperboard business as this was management’s best estimate of the minimum impairment charge that would be required upon the completion of detailed step two analyses in february 2009 based on additional work performed to date management determined that it was probable that all of the 13 billion of recorded goodwill for the us printing papers business would be impaired when testing was completed accordingly an additional goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized the testing for these businesses resulting in no changes to the recorded impairment charges 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2009 or 2007 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

  

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2009 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash payments are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2010 pension expense by approximately 19 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 29 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 59 and 56 for the last five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 19992009 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under 

the plans approximately 9 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 178 million and 30 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the increase in 2009 us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the assumed discount 

rate to 600 in 2009 from 620 in 2008 a decrease in the return on assets assumption to 825 in 2009 from 850 in 2008 and higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2009 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

  

 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 234 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2010 with the increase from expense of 213 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher amortization of actuarial losses and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 580 in 2010 from 600 in 2009 net postretirement benefit costs in 2010 will decrease primarily as a result of a plan amendment which increased cost sharing for a subgroup of retirees and more favorable terms from the pharmacy benefit manager for prescription drugs 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2009 totaled approximately 68 billion consisting of approximately 49 equity securities 32 debt securities and 19 real estate and other assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company expects to have no obligation to fund its domestic qualified plan in 2010 and made no contributions in 2009 the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make such a contribution in the next 12 months the nonqualified 

  

defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 35 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

accounting for stock options international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 222 million options and 251 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6669 per share 

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 39 14 and 25 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2009 was 30 of pretax earnings compared with 315 in 2008 and 30 in 2007 the higher rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2010 effective income tax rate will be approximately 3032 based on expected earnings and business conditions

legal proceedings 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 15 million was spent in 2009 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 55 million in 2010 for similar capital projects the capital forecast for 2010 reflects increased spending due to recent environmental regulatory changes including the greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule and the effect of the startupshutdownmalfunction pro visions being vacated by the dc circuit court 

amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental expenditures is approximately 92 million for 2011 and approximately 151 million for 2012 the environmental protection agency epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as boiler mact additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future requirements to our expenditure forecast 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 55 such sites and that its liability at 47 other sites is likely to be 

significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 102 matters is approximately 58 million 

during the 2009 third quarter in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla international paper submitted to the epa a feasibility study for this site the epa has indicated that it intends to select a proposed remedial action alternative from those identified in the study and present this proposal for public comment since it is not currently possible to determine the final remedial action that will be required the company has accrued as of december 31 2009 an estimate of the minimum costs that could be required for this site when the remediation plan is finalized by the epa it is possible that the remediation costs could be significantly higher than amounts currently recorded 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at international paper current or former facilities and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 46 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of january 31 2010 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

climate change regulation 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of international national and subnational regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

in the united states on the federal level the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in addition several states have already taken legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the 

  

planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs 

it is possible that congress various states the environmental protection agency or analogous state regulators may adopt legislation or rules that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases since the outcome of the current climate change debate is unclear it is not possible at this time to assess the impact if any and the scope of such legislation or regulations on our operations in the united states however it is unlikely that we will be disproportionately affected compared with owners of comparable operations in the united states 

the european union under the european emissions trading system euets has committed to greenhouse gas reductions international paper has two sites which will be covered by the euets in 2010 we believe that the euets reduction requirements will not have a material effect on our european operations in 2010 although they may have a material effect in the future we have taken and will continue to take action as appropriate to minimize any such impact as in the us it is unlikely that we will be disproportionately affected compared with owners of comparable operations in the european union 

the framework of the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” brazil morocco and china three countries where we have operations are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol a successor to the kyoto protocol is being discussed by representatives of various developed and underdeveloped countries and it is unclear whether agreement among various countries will be reached moreover countries that currently do not regulate greenhouse gases may adopt their own regulations in the future whether or not they are signatories to a successor protocol due to the lack of clarity around any post 2012 climate change regime it is not possible at this time to assess the potential impacts if any of future international agreements or national legislation on international paper’s operations 

in summary regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in all countries in which we do business while there may be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this stage it is not possible to predict what if any regulations will be adopted or to estimate either the timing for implementation or our costs of compliance 

  

other than the regulatory risks we have identified no clear patterns of physical social or market related risks associated with climate change 

other legal matters 

the company is involved in various inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property intellectual property environmental permits taxes personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the european euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

  

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2009 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2009 and 2008 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 77 billion and 64 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 394 million and 366 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2009 and 2008 was approximately 26 million and 75 million respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 20 million and 18 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2009 and 2008 the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 32 million and 2 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 73 million and 105 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition these controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

   

  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to such financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2009 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on pages 49 and 50 management concluded that based on its assessment the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2009 

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and 

  

control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of five independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following 

are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials principally virgin wood fiber recycled fiber caustic soda and starch energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and thirdparty companies that transport our goods the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source in addition the increase in demand of products manufactured in whole or in part from recycled fiber on a global basis may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber energy prices in particular prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

  

risks relating to market and economic factors 

continued adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operation general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets which impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position similarly we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating if this were to happen it may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained 

the impairment of financial institutions may adversely affect us we have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions including us and foreign commercial banks insurance companies investment banks investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade bankruptcy liquidity default or similar risks especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil a ratings downgrade bankruptcy receivership default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital liquidity position future business and results of operations 

  

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us salaried employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business as of december 31 2009 we had 90 billion of longterm debt including notes payable and current maturities and the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our debt or are unable to refinance our debt because credit market conditions become volatile this may have an adverse impact on our cost of borrowing liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” at december 31 2009 was 28 billion although we expect to have no obligation to fund our plans in 2010 we continually reassess the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make such a contribution in 2010 regardless of whether we make a discretionary contribution in 2010 over the next several years we will make contributions to the plans that are likely to be material the amount of such contributions will depend upon 

  

a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the impact of possible funding relief legislation currently under consideration in the us congress 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety there can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs 

  

results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results 

several operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit several operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim joint venture in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures for additional information with respect to our ilim joint venture see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation – liquidity and capital resources – ilim holding sa shareholders agreement” on page 37

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper company reported net sales of 234 billion in 2009 compared with 248 billion in 2008 and 219 billion in 2007 net earnings totaled 663 million in 2009 including 14 billion of alternative fuel mixture credits and 853 million of charges to restructure ongoing businesses compared with a loss of 13 billion in 2008 which included a 18 billion goodwill impairment charge net earnings in 2007 totaled 12 billion 

the company performed well in 2009 considering the magnitude of the challenges it faced both domestically and around the world despite weak global economic conditions the company generated record cash flow from operations enabling us to reduce longterm debt by 31 billion while increasing cash balances by approximately 800 million also during 2009 the company incurred 36 million tons of downtime including 11 million tons associated with the shutdown of production capacity in our north american mill system to continue to match our production to our customers’ needs these actions should result in higher operating rates lower fixed costs and lower payroll costs in 2010 and beyond furthermore the realization of integration synergies in our us industrial packaging business and overhead reduction initiatives across the company position international paper to benefit from a lower cost profile in future years 

as 2010 begins we expect that firstquarter operations will continue to be challenging in addition to being a seasonally slow quarter for many of our businesses poor harvesting weather conditions in the us south and increasing competition for limited supplies of recycled fiber are expected to lead to further increases in fiber costs for our us mills planned maintenance outage expenses will also be higher than in the 2009 fourth quarter however we have announced product price increases for our major global manufacturing businesses and while these actions may not have a significant effect on firstquarter results we believe that the benefits beginning in the second quarter will be significant additionally we expect to benefit from the capacity management cost reduction and integration synergy actions taken during 2009 as a result the company remains positive about projected operating results in 2010 with improved earnings versus 2009 expected 

in all major businesses we will continue to focus on aggressive cost management and strong cash flow generation as 2010 progresses 

results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes equity earnings noncontrolling interests interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in six segments industrial packaging printing papers consumer packaging distribution forest products and specialty businesses and other 

the following table shows the components of net earnings loss attributable to international paper company for each of the last three years 

 

  industry segment operating profits of 24 billion were 967 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 operating profits benefited from lower energy and raw material costs 447 million lower distribution costs 142 million favorable manufacturing operating costs 481 million incremental earnings from the cbpr business acquired in the third quarter of 2008 202 million and other items 35 million offset by lower average sales price realizations 444 million lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 684 million unfavorable 

  

mix of products sold 109 million and lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales 383 million however special items were a gain of 898 million in 2009 compared with a loss of 382 million in 2008

special items 

restructuring and other charges 

international paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to a focus our portfolio on our core businesses b rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities and c reduce costs annually strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses if it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility’s plan will not be achieved a decision is then made to a invest additional capital to upgrade the facility b shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge or c evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred in recent years this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur 

during 2009 the company closed or announced the pending closure of five mills globally closed 24 converting or distribution locations and reduced overhead headcount through a program initiated in 2008 these actions will allow the company to reduce its fixed costs reduce payroll costs due to a reduction in headcount by 6000 and should result in higher operating rates in 2010 and beyond we expect the annual savings from these actions to approximate 650 million 

2009 during 2009 corporate restructuring and other charges totaling 333 million before taxes 205 million after taxes were recorded these charges included

industry segment operating profits 

industry segment operating profits of 24 billion in 2009 increased from both 14 billion in 2008 and 19 billion in 2007 reflecting a 898 million net gain from special items in 2009 versus a 382 million net loss in 2008 the benefits of lower energy and raw material costs 447 million lower distribution costs 142 million favorable manufacturing operating costs 481 million incremental earnings from the cbpr business acquired in the third quarter of 2008 202 million and other items 35 million were offset by lower average sales price realizations 444 million lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 684 million unfavorable mix of products sold 109 million and lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales 383 million 

lackoforder downtime in 2009 increased to approximately 36 million tons compared with approximately one million tons in 2008 and 50000 tons in 2007 the 2009 total includes approximately 400000 tons associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at our valliant mill in 2009 and 50000 tons associated with the permanent shutdown of our pineville and albany mills at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 in addition approximately 600000 tons are included in the 2009 total and 105000 tons are included in the 2008 total associated with the permanent shutdown of our bastrop mill and the shutdown of an uncoated paper machine at our franklin mill in the fourth quarter of 2008 

looking ahead to the 2010 first quarter operating conditions in january and february are expected to be difficult the first quarter is typically a seasonally slow period and we anticipate only modest us economic recovery input cost inflation experienced in the 2009 fourth quarter is expected to continue reflecting poor wood harvesting conditions in the us south due to unusually cold and wet weather and strong global competition for recycled fiber primarily due to a reduction in supply for recycled fiber caused by the global recession in 2009 demand for north american paper and packaging should improve slightly while slight seasonal decreases are expected in other global markets pulp prices are expected to continue to improve and we expect to realize previously announced price 

  

increases on paper and packaging grades as the first quarter progresses planned maintenance outage costs in the united states are expected to increase while remaining about flat in europe and brazil earnings from our xpedx distribution business will reflect seasonally lower shipments and the absence of a favorable inventory valuation adjustment in the 2009 fourth quarter equity earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to decrease reflecting higher input costs an extended mill outage and foreign exchange losses

industry segment results 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production as well as with demand for processed foods 

poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging results for 2009 and 2008 include the cbpr business acquired in the 2008 third quarter net sales for 2009 increased 16 to 89 billion compared with 77 billion in 2008 and 69 compared with 52 billion in 2007 operating profits were 95 higher in 2009 than in 2008 and more than double 2007 levels benefits from higher total yearoveryear shipments including the impact of the cbpr business 11 million favorable operating costs 294 million and lower raw material and freight costs 295 million were partially offset by the effects of lower price realizations 243 million higher corporate overhead allocations 85 million incremental integration costs associated with the acquisition of the cbpr business 3 million and higher other costs 7 million additionally operating profits in 2009 included a gain of 849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits us plant closure costs of 653 million and costs associated with the shutdown of the etienne mill in france of 87 million 

 

 north american industrial packaging results include the net sales and operating profits of the cbpr business from the august 4 2008 acquisition date net sales were 76 billion in 2009 compared with 62 billion in 2008 and 39 billion in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were 791 million 682 million excluding alternative fuel mixture credits mill closure costs and costs associated with the cbpr integration compared with 322 million 414 million excluding charges related to the writeup of cbpr inventory to fair value cbpr integration costs and other facility closure costs in 2008 and 305 million in 2007 

excluding the effect of the cbpr acquisition containerboard and box shipments were lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weaker customer demand average sales price realizations were significantly lower for both containerboard and boxes due to weaker worldwide economic conditions however average sales margins for boxes 

  

increased reflecting a slower decline in box prices than in the raw material cost of containerboard and cbpr integration benefits fullyear input costs for wood energy and chemicals were lower although costs for fiber and energy increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2009 freight costs were also lower planned maintenance downtime costs decreased slightly from 2008 levels and operating costs were significantly lower particularly in the box plants reflecting benefits from cost control initiatives lackoforder downtime totaled 22 million tons including approximately 450000 tons related to the idled paper machine at the valliant oklahoma mill and the late december shutdowns of the albany oregon and pineville louisiana mills in 2009 compared with 700000 tons in 2008 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2010 sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009 and average sales price realizations are expected to improve by the end of the quarter reflecting the impact of previously announced price increases for containerboard however input costs are expected to be significantly higher for energy as well as for wood and recycled fiber due to poor harvesting weather conditions in the us south and strong competition for recycled fiber planned maintenance downtime costs will also be higher with outages scheduled at five mills manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower reflecting benefits of the mill closures in december and improved operations 

european industrial packaging net sales for 2009 were 980 million compared with 12 billion in 2008 and 11 billion in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were a loss of 30 million a gain of 57 million excluding costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in france compared with earnings of 64 million in 2008 and 67 million in 2007 sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 principally reflecting weak customer demand for industrial packaging containers throughout the region sales margins improved as reductions in kraft and recycled containerboard costs were greater than declines in box prices input costs were favorable primarily for energy but operating costs were unfavorable the operating loss in 2009 includes 87 million of costs associated with the closure of the etienne mill in november 2009 

entering the first quarter of 2010 sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonally weaker demand for agricultural boxes and continued weak demand for industrial packaging boxes average sales price realizations for boxes are expected to 

improve but costs for containerboard are expected to increase 

asian industrial packaging net sales for 2009 were 325 million compared with 350 million in 2008 and 265 million in 2007 operating profits in 2009 were about breakeven earnings of 2 million excluding the impairment of an investment in a joint venture compared with profits of 4 million in 2008 and 2 million in 2007

liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2010 

capital expenditures and longterm debt 

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2010 through current cash balances and cash from operations supplemented as required by its various existing credit facilities 

at december 31 2009 international paper had approximately 19 billion in cash and 25 billion of committed liquidity facilities including a 15 billion 

  

contractually committed revolving bank credit agreement and 10 billion of commercial paperbased financing based on eligible receivable balances under a receivables securitization program which management believes are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a predetermined margin dependent upon international paper’s credit rating in november 2009 international paper replaced its 15 billion revolving bank credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in march 2011 with a new 15 billion fully committed revolving bank credit agreement that expires in november 2012 and has a facility fee of 050 payable quarterly the liquidity facilities also include up to 10 billion of commercial paperbased financings on eligible receivable balances 816 million at december 31 2009 under a receivables securitization program that was scheduled to expire in january 2010 with a facility fee of 075 on january 13 2010 the company amended this program to extend the maturity date from january 2010 to january 2011 the amended agreement has a facility fee of 050 payable monthly at december 31 2009 there were no borrowings under either the bank credit agreements or receivables securitization program 

the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at december 31 2009 the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a totaldebttocapital ratio of less than 60 net worth is defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss the totaldebttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth at december 31 2009 international paper’s net worth was 118 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 433 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

  

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2009 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb negative outlook and baa3 negative outlook and shortterm credit ratings of a3 and p3 by sp and moody’s respectively 

on february 5 2010 moody’s investor services reduced its credit rating of senior unsecured longterm debt of the royal bank of scotland nv formerly abn amro bank nv which had issued letters of credit that support 14 billion of installment notes received in connection with the company’s 2006 sale of forestlands following this sale the installment notes were contributed to thirdparty entities that used them as collateral for borrowings from a thirdparty lender the related loan agreements require that if the credit rating of any bank issuing letters of credit is downgraded below a specified level these letters of credit must be replaced within 60 days by letters of credit from another qualifying institution the company expects that the issuer of installment notes will complete this replacement within the required 60day period 

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2009 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us generally accepted accounting principles was approximately 28 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 24 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level at this time we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of december 31 2009 will require the company to make cash contributions to its plans in 2010 although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions the timing and amount of future contributions which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the possible impact of funding relief proposals that may be adopted by the us congress 

ilim holding sa shareholders’ agreement 

in october 2007 in connection with the formation of the ilim holding sa joint venture ilim international paper entered into a shareholders’ agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners this agreement provides that at any time after the second anniversary of the formation of ilim either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions under certain circumstances the company would be required to purchase its partners’ 50 interest in ilim any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities based on the provisions of the agreement international paper estimates that the current purchase 

price for its partners’ 50 interests would be approximately 350 million to 400 million which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock or some combination of the two at the company’s option any such purchase by international paper would result in the consolidation of ilim’s financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provision of the shareholders’ agreement although they have the right to do so and they are no longer discussing a deferral of the timeframe to commence those procedures 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include the accounting for contingencies impairment or disposal of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pensions postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations 

  

and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors including future selling prices and volumes operating raw material energy and freight costs and various other projected operating economic factors as these key factors change in future periods the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

  

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

goodwill impairment analysis under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc 350 “intangibles–goodwill and other” the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operat  

  

ing conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

during 2008 as in prior years the company performed the required annual goodwill testing for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter resulting in a 59 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill for the company’s european coated paperboard business subsequent to this testing date the company performed an interim test as of december 31 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow projections and higher costofcapital discount rates based on this testing step two testing for possible impairment was required for the company’s us printing papers business and its us coated paperboard business based on management’s preliminary estimates an additional goodwill impairment charge of 379 million was recorded representing all of the goodwill for the us coated paperboard business as this was management’s best estimate of the minimum impairment charge that would be required upon the completion of detailed step two analyses in february 2009 based on additional work performed to date management determined that it was probable that all of the 13 billion of recorded goodwill for the us printing papers business would be impaired when testing was completed accordingly an additional goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 during the first quarter of 2009 the company finalized the testing for these businesses resulting in no changes to the recorded impairment charges 

no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2009 or 2007 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

  

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2009 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash payments are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2010 pension expense by approximately 19 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 29 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the annualized timeweighted rate of return earned on us pension plan assets was 59 and 56 for the last five and ten years respectively the following graph shows the growth of a 1000 investment in international paper’s us pension plan master trust the graph portrays the timeweighted rate of return from 19992009 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under 

the plans approximately 9 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 178 million and 30 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the increase in 2009 us pension expense principally reflects a decrease in the assumed discount 

rate to 600 in 2009 from 620 in 2008 a decrease in the return on assets assumption to 825 in 2009 from 850 in 2008 and higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2009 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

  

 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 234 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2010 with the increase from expense of 213 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher amortization of actuarial losses and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 580 in 2010 from 600 in 2009 net postretirement benefit costs in 2010 will decrease primarily as a result of a plan amendment which increased cost sharing for a subgroup of retirees and more favorable terms from the pharmacy benefit manager for prescription drugs 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2009 totaled approximately 68 billion consisting of approximately 49 equity securities 32 debt securities and 19 real estate and other assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company expects to have no obligation to fund its domestic qualified plan in 2010 and made no contributions in 2009 the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make such a contribution in the next 12 months the nonqualified 

  

defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 35 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

accounting for stock options international paper follows asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” in accounting for stock options under this guidance expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 222 million options and 251 million options respectively were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6669 per share 

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rates before equity earnings and discontinued operations were 39 14 and 25 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur in those years excluding these special items the effective income tax rate for 2009 was 30 of pretax earnings compared with 315 in 2008 and 30 in 2007 the higher rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2010 effective income tax rate will be approximately 3032 based on expected earnings and business conditions

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june 2006 the fasb issued guidance under asc 740 “income taxes” formerly fin 48 this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax returns specifically the financial statement effects of a tax position may be recognized only when it is determined that it is “more likely than not” that based on its technical merits the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority the amount recognized shall be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits that exceed a 50 probability of being recognized this guidance also expands income tax disclosure requirements international paper applied the provisions of this guidance beginning in the first quarter of 2007 the adoption of this guidance resulted in a charge to the beginning balance of retained earnings of 94 million at the date of adoption 

  

legal proceedings 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 15 million was spent in 2009 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 55 million in 2010 for similar capital projects the capital forecast for 2010 reflects increased spending due to recent environmental regulatory changes including the greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule and the effect of the startupshutdownmalfunction pro visions being vacated by the dc circuit court 

amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental expenditures is approximately 92 million for 2011 and approximately 151 million for 2012 the environmental protection agency epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as boiler mact additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future requirements to our expenditure forecast 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 55 such sites and that its liability at 47 other sites is likely to be 

significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 102 matters is approximately 58 million 

during the 2009 third quarter in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla international paper submitted to the epa a feasibility study for this site the epa has indicated that it intends to select a proposed remedial action alternative from those identified in the study and present this proposal for public comment since it is not currently possible to determine the final remedial action that will be required the company has accrued as of december 31 2009 an estimate of the minimum costs that could be required for this site when the remediation plan is finalized by the epa it is possible that the remediation costs could be significantly higher than amounts currently recorded 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at international paper current or former facilities and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 46 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of january 31 2010 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

climate change regulation 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of international national and subnational regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

in the united states on the federal level the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in addition several states have already taken legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the 

  

planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs 

it is possible that congress various states the environmental protection agency or analogous state regulators may adopt legislation or rules that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases since the outcome of the current climate change debate is unclear it is not possible at this time to assess the impact if any and the scope of such legislation or regulations on our operations in the united states however it is unlikely that we will be disproportionately affected compared with owners of comparable operations in the united states 

the european union under the european emissions trading system euets has committed to greenhouse gas reductions international paper has two sites which will be covered by the euets in 2010 we believe that the euets reduction requirements will not have a material effect on our european operations in 2010 although they may have a material effect in the future we have taken and will continue to take action as appropriate to minimize any such impact as in the us it is unlikely that we will be disproportionately affected compared with owners of comparable operations in the european union 

the framework of the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” brazil morocco and china three countries where we have operations are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol a successor to the kyoto protocol is being discussed by representatives of various developed and underdeveloped countries and it is unclear whether agreement among various countries will be reached moreover countries that currently do not regulate greenhouse gases may adopt their own regulations in the future whether or not they are signatories to a successor protocol due to the lack of clarity around any post 2012 climate change regime it is not possible at this time to assess the potential impacts if any of future international agreements or national legislation on international paper’s operations 

in summary regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in all countries in which we do business while there may be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this stage it is not possible to predict what if any regulations will be adopted or to estimate either the timing for implementation or our costs of compliance 

  

other than the regulatory risks we have identified no clear patterns of physical social or market related risks associated with climate change 

other legal matters 

the company is involved in various inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property intellectual property environmental permits taxes personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the european euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

  

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2009 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2009 and 2008 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 77 billion and 64 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 394 million and 366 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value liability of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2009 and 2008 was approximately 26 million and 75 million respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 20 million and 18 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2009 and 2008 the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 32 million and 2 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 73 million and 105 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of international paper and its whollyowned controlled majorityowned and financially controlled subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated 

international paper accounts for its investment in ilim holding sa ilim a separate reportable industry segment using the equity method of accounting due to the complex organizational structure of ilim’s operations and the extended time required to prepare consolidated financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the company reports its share of ilim’s operating results on a onequarter lag basis 

investments in affiliated companies where the company has significant influence over their operations are accounted for by the equity method international paper’s share of affiliates’ earnings totaled a loss of 49 million and earnings of 49 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated fob free on board shipping point for sales transactions designated fob 

destination revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site when title and risk of loss are transferred timber and timberland sales revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 

alternative fuel mixture credits – cost of products sold 

the us internal revenue code provides a tax credit for companies that use alternative fuel mixtures to produce energy to operate their businesses as these credits represent a reduction of energy costs at the company’s us manufacturing facilities the credits are included as a reduction of cost of products sold in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations see alternative fuel mixture credits in note 5 for a further discussion of these credits 

shipping and handling costs 

shipping and handling costs such as freight to our customers’ destinations are included in distribution expenses in the consolidated statement of operations when shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products they are recognized in net sales 

annual maintenance costs 

costs for repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting 

temporary investments 

temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost which approximates market 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and manufacturing overhead in the united states costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products are generally determined using the lastin firstout method other inventories are valued using the firstin firstout or average cost methods 

plants properties and equipment 

plants properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation expenditures for 

  

  

betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred the unitsofproduction method of depreciation is used for major pulp and paper mills and the straightline method is used for other plants and equipment annual straightline depreciation rates are for buildings – 2 12 to 8 12 and for machinery and equipment – 5 to 33 

forestlands 

at december 31 2009 international paper and its subsidiaries owned or managed about 200000 acres of forestlands in the united states approximately 250000 acres in brazil and through licenses and forest management agreements had harvesting rights on governmentowned forestlands in russia costs attributable to timber are charged against income as trees are cut the rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume 

goodwill 

goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment while goodwill arising from major acquisitions that involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset for segment reporting purposes for goodwill impairment testing this goodwill is allocated to reporting units annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year with additional interim testing performed when management believes that it is more likely than not that events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill 

in performing this testing the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated cost of capital for each reporting unit these estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to historic market transactions for businesses in the industry and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s traded stock price on the testing date for reporting units whose recorded value of net assets plus goodwill is in excess of their estimated fair values the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the respective reporting units are then determined to calculate the amount of any goodwill impairment charge required see note 9 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value see note 7 

income taxes 

international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted 

international paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain liabilities are recorded based upon the company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year a change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

while the judgments and estimates made by the company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts resulting in charges or credits that could materially affect future financial statements 

  

  

stockbased compensation 

compensation costs resulting from all stockbased compensation transactions are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on the grantdate fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued in addition liability awards are remeasured each reporting period compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 

environmental remediation costs 

costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable 

asset retirement obligations 

a liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of longlived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated the liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility international paper’s asset retirement obligations principally relate to closure costs for landfills revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing of closures or possible new federal or state regulations affecting these closures 

in connection with potential future closures or redesigns of certain production facilities it is possible that the company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from these facilities applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations at this time any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date and the company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expectedpresentvalue technique to estimate any such potential obligations accordingly the company does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation 

  

translation of financial statements 

balance sheets of international operations are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates while statements of operations are translated at average rates adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss

 the company’s deferred income tax provision benefit includes a 1 million provision a 14 million provision and a 2 million provision for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively for the effect of changes in nonus and us state tax rates 

international paper made income tax payments net of refunds of 97 million 131 million and 328 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

a reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory us income tax rate compared with actual income tax provision follows 

 

 the tax effects of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 

  

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions deferred income tax assets deferred charges and other assets other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes the decrease in 2009 in deferred tax assets principally relates to the tax impact of changes in recorded qualified pension liabilities minimum tax credit utilization and an increase in the valuation allowance the decrease in deferred income tax liabilities principally relates to less tax depreciation taken on the company’s assets purchased in 2009 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december 31 2008 was 72 million the net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended december 31 2009 was an increase of 274 million the increase of 274 million consists primarily of 1 211 million related to the company’s french operations including a valuation allowance of 55 million against net deferred tax assets from current year operations and 156 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for the establishment of a valuation allowance against previously recorded deferred tax assets 2 10 million for net deferred tax assets arising from the company’s united kingdom current year operations and 3 47 million related to a reduction of previously recorded us state deferred tax assets including 15 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 for louisiana recycling credits the effect on the company’s effective tax rate of the aforementioned 211 million and 10 million is included in the line item “tax rate and permanent differences on nonus earnings”

included in the balance at december 31 2009 and 2008 are 56 million and 9 million respectively for tax positions for which the ultimate benefits are highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such benefits however except for the possible effect of any penalties any disallowance that would change the timing of these benefits would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period

foreign exchange contracts are used by international paper to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and are not designated as hedges changes in the fair value of these instruments recognized in earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities totaled a loss of approximately 50 million and 30 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and a gain of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 outstanding undesignated foreign exchange contracts included the following 

 

 fair value hedges 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings

cash flow hedges 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of aoci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures the fair value of the hedge instruments are reclassified out of aoci to earnings if the hedge ceases to be highly effective or if the hedged transaction is no longer probable

fair value measurements 

 

international paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts including interest rate swaps foreign currency forward contracts and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and currency risks for these financial instruments fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that takes into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date such as prevailing interest rates and foreign currency spot and forward rates the guidance for fair value measure  

ments and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups fair value measurement inputs into three classifications level 1 level 2 and level 3 level 1 inputs are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability all of international paper’s fair value measurements use level 2 inputs the following table provides a summary of the impact of our derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet

creditriskrelated contingent features 

international paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy limits credit risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks most of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or international paper based on each party’s rating and level of exposure based on the company’s current credit rating the collateral threshold is generally 10 million if the lower of the company’s credit rating by moody’s or sp were to drop below investment grade the company would be required to post collateral for the majority of its derivatives in a net liability position although no derivatives would terminate the fair values of derivative instruments containing creditriskrelated contingent features in a net liability position were 65 million as of december 31 2009 and 109 million as of december 31 2008 the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral as of december 31 2009 and 12 million of collateral as of december 31 2008 due to exceeding the counterparty’s collateral threshold in the normal course of business in addition existing derivative contracts provide for netting across most derivative positions in the event a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation international paper currently does not expect any of the counterparties to default on their obligations

the company also has two unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plans a pension restoration plan available to employees hired prior to july 1 2004 that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the internal revenue service and a supplemental retirement plan for senior managers serp which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants these nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid which totaled 35 million 24 million and 29 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and which are expected to be 41 million in 2010 

net periodic pension expense 

service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation which is a discounted amount due to the passage of time the expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of currentyear earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated longterm rate of return 

net periodic pension expense for qualified and nonqualified us defined benefit plans comprised the following 

 

  

 

 the increase in 2009 pension expense reflects a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 600 in 2009 from 620 in 2008 a decrease in the assumed return on plan assets to 825 in 2009 from 850 in 2008 and higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses the decrease in 2008 expense compared with 2007 reflects an increase in the assumed discount rate to 620 from 575 and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december 31 the measurement date and considers changes in these longterm factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions these assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of december 31 of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year ie the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of december 31 2008 was also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the 2009 year 

weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio projected rates of return are developed through an assetliability study in which projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes based on the target asset allocation for each asset class the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering 

  

  

the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash flows are then matched to the yield curve to develop the discount rate to calculate pension expense for 2010 the company will use an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 825 a discount rate of 580 and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 375 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 234 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2010 with the increase from expense of 213 million in 2009 reflecting higher amortization of actuarial losses and a decrease in the assumed discount rate 

the following illustrates the effect on pension expense for 2010 of a 25 basis point decrease in the above assumptions 

 

 investment policy  strategy 

international paper’s board of directors has appointed a fiduciary review committee that is responsible for overseeing the operations of the plan approving its investment policy and reviewing the management and control of plan assets plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk the plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses derivatives including swaps forward and futures contracts may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes periodic reviews are made of investment policy objectives and investment manager performance 

international paper’s pension allocations by type of account at december 31 and target allocations were as follows 

 

   

the fair values of international paper’s pension plan assets at december 31 2009 by asset class are shown below no international paper company shares were included in plan assets in 2009 or 2008 hedge funds disclosed in the following table are allocated equally between equity and fixed income accounts for target allocation purposes cash and cash equivalent portfolios are allocated to the types of account from which they originated 

 

 equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded us and international companies publicly traded equities are valued at closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded 

fixed income consists of corporate bonds government securities mortgage backed securities and common collective funds government securities are valued at closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted cash 

  

  

flow approach that utilizes observable inputs such as current yields of similar instruments but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks 

other investments are valued at net asset value which is calculated using the most recent partnership financial reports 

common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date 

private equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in us and nonus debt and equity secu  

rities partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partnership statement of fair value updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash flows 

commodities consist of commoditylinked notes and commoditylinked derivative contracts commodities are valued at closing prices determined by calculation agents for outstanding transactions 

derivative investments such as futures forward contracts options and swaps are used to help manage risks derivative instruments are generally valued by investment managers or in certain instances by third party pricing sources 

the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 at december 31 2009 are as follows

at december 31 2009 projected future pension benefit payments excluding any termination benefits are as follows 

 

 pension plan asset  liability 

as required by asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” the pension plan funded status must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet therefore pension plan gains or losses and prior service costs not yet recognized in net periodic cost are recognized on a netoftax basis in oci these amounts will be subject to amortization in the future at december 31 2009 the fair value of plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan was less than the projected benefit obligation pbo however the deficit was lower than at december 31 2008 resulting in a decrease in the recorded minimum pension obligation of 468 million and an aftertax credit to oci of 318 million an aftertax charge to oci of 18 billion and an aftertax credit of 361 million had been recorded for 2008 and 2007 respectively for the unfunded nonqualified plans changes in the liabilities resulted in an aftertax charge to oci of 9 million in 2009 and an aftertax charge to oci of 5 million and an aftertax credit to oci of 10 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2008 in conjunction with the cbpr business acquisition the company acquired a small overfunded pension plan covering hourly employees at the albany oregon mill for this plan the company recorded an aftertax charge to oci of 13 million at december 31 2008 

  

the accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was 93 billion and 90 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the following table summarizes information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 unrecognized actuarial losses 

asc 715 “compensation – retirement benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately 9 years as of december 31 2009 to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from aoci into net periodic pension cost during the next fiscal year are expected to be 178 million and 30 million respectively 

  

  

the following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for 2009 and 2008 and the plans’ funded status the benefit obligation as of december 31 2009 increased by 269 million principally as a result of a decrease in the discount rate assumption used in computing the estimated benefit obligation plan assets increased by 705 million reflecting favorable investment results the fair value of plan assets is determined using quoted closing market prices for publicly traded securities where available investments without readily determinable market prices are valued at their estimated fair values 

 

 the components of the 697 million decrease in the amounts recognized in oci during 2009 consisted of 

 

   

the portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized either in net periodic benefit costs or oci was 483 million 3 billion and 603 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively

 the portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized in either net periodic benefit cost or oci was 11 million 40 million and 41 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

for nonus plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets the projected benefit obligations accumulated benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets totaled 129 million 121 million and 81 million respectively at december 31 2009 plan assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities 

other plans 

international paper sponsors defined contribution plans primarily 401k plans to provide substantially all us salaried and certain hourly employees of international paper an opportunity to accumulate personal funds and to provide additional benefits to employees hired after june 30 2004 for their retirement contributions may be made on a beforetax or aftertax basis to substantially all of these plans 

as determined by the provisions of each plan international paper matches the employees’ elective contributions and for employees hired after june 30 2004 contributes an additional percentage of pay beginning in february 2009 matching contributions to the salaried savings plan were made in company stock company matching contributions to the plans totaled approximately 121 million 80 million and 91 million for the plan years ending in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

note 17 postretirement benefits 

us postretirement benefits 

international paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain us salaried and hourly employees these employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service excluded from companyprovided medical benefits are salaried employees whose age plus years of employment with the company totaled less than 60 as of january 1 2004 international paper does not fund these benefits prior to payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future 

the components of postretirement benefit expense in 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 

  

  

 international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december 31 the measurement date and considers changes in these longterm factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 

the discount rates used to determine net cost for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 the weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december 31 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 a 1 increase in the assumed annual health care cost trend rate would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2009 by approximately 24 million a 1 decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2009 by approximately 21 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease would be approximately 2 million 

  

the plan is only funded in an amount equal to benefits paid the following table presents the changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for 2009 and 2008 

 

 the noncurrent portion of the liability is included with the postemployment liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under postretirement and postemployment benefit obligation in accordance with guidance under asc 715 an aftertax credit of 41 million and an aftertax charge of 16 million was recorded as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

note 18 incentive plans 

international paper currently has an incentive compensation plan icp that upon the approval by the company’s shareholders in may 2009 replaced the company’s longterm incentive compensation plan lticp the icp authorizes grants of restricted stock restricted or deferred stock units performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment 

of specified performance goals dividend equivalents stock options stock appreciation rights other stockbased awards and cashbased awards at the discretion of the management development and compensation committee of the board of directors the committee that administers the icp additionally stock appreciation rights sar’s have been awarded to employees of a nonus subsidiary with 3310 rights outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 restricted stock units rsu’s were also awarded to certain nonus employees in 2008 with 44100 and 59100 units outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively additionally restricted stock which may be deferred into rsu’s may be awarded under a restricted stock and deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors 

stock option program 

international paper accounts for stock options in accordance with guidance under asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation” compensation expense is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value since all outstanding options were vested as of july 14 2005 only replacement option grants were expensed in 2007 no replacement options were granted in 2008 or 2009 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

under the program upon exercise of an option a replacement option may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration date of the original option 

the company has discontinued the issuance of stock options for all eligible us and nonus employees in the united states the stock option program was replaced with a performancebased restricted share program to more closely tie longterm incentive compensation to company performance on two key performance drivers return on investment roi and total shareholder return tsr 

  

  

the fair market value of each option grant has been estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2007 

 

  

 the following summarizes the status of the stock option program and the changes during the three years ending december 31 2009 

 

  

    

performancebased restricted shares 

under the performance share program psp contingent awards of international paper common stock are granted by the committee the psp awards are earned over a threeyear period onefourth of the award is earned during each twelvemonth period with the final onefourth segment earned over the full threeyear period psp awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance rankings of return on investment roi and total shareholder return tsr compared to roi and tsr peer groups of companies awards are weighted 75 for roi and 25 for tsr for all participants except for officers for whom the awards are weighted 50 for roi and 50 for tsr the roi component of the psp awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date as the roi component contains a performance condition compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest the tsr component of the psp awards is valued using a monte carlo simulation as the tsr component contains a market condition the monte carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the tsr component based on the expected term of the award a riskfree rate expected dividends and the expected volatility for the company and its competitors the expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards the riskfree rate is based on the yield on us treasury securities matching the vesting period the expected dividends are assumed to be zero for all companies and the volatility is based on the company’s historical volatility over the expected term 

psp awards issued to certain members of senior management are accounted for as liability awards which are remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date the valuation of these psp liability awards is computed based on the same methodology as the psp equity awards 

the following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the psp plan 

 

 

  

  

the following summarizes psp activity for the three years ending december 31 2009 

 

  

 executive continuity and restricted stock award programs 

the executive continuity award program provides for the granting of tandem awards of restricted stock andor nonqualified stock options to key executives grants are restricted and awards conditioned on attainment of a specified age the awarding of a tandem stock option results in the cancellation of the related restricted shares 

the servicebased restricted stock award program rsa designed for recruitment retention and special recognition purposes also provides for awards of restricted stock to key employees 

  

the following summarizes the activity of the executive continuity award program and rsa program for the three years ending december 31 2009 

 

 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 a total of 174 million 281 million and 274 million shares respectively were available for grant under the icp 

total stockbased compensation cost recognized in selling and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 100 million 66 million and 124 million respectively the actual tax deduction realized for stockbased compensation costs related to nonqualified stock options was 0 19000 and 15 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the actual tax deduction realized for stockbased compensation costs related to restricted and performance shares was 28 million 130 million and 60 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively at december 31 2009 497 million of compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to unvested restricted performance shares executive continuity awards and restricted stock attributable to future performance had not yet been recognized this amount will be recognized in expense over a weightedaverage period of 14 years

raw materials essential to our businesses include wood fiber purchased in the form of pulpwood wood chips and old corrugated containers occ and certain chemicals including caustic soda starch and polyethylene information concerning fiber supply purchase agreements that were entered into in connection with the company’s 2006 transformation plan is presented in note 11 commitments and contingent liabilities on page 76 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

  

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials energy and transportation could affect our profitability we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber caustic soda and polyethylene energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil and third party companies that transport our goods our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials energy sources and transportation sources 

the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows substantially all of our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue to experience cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product in addition changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiberbased products and nonfiber substitutes consequently our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products 

competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

continued adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our prod ucts and our financial condition and results of operation general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and consumer confidence all of which impact demand for our products in addition continued volatility in the capital and credit markets which 

  

impacts interest rates currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and our results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our company’s ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing in light of current economic conditions the company’s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow including sale of assets reduction or suspension of the dividend and further reductions in capital expenditures and working capital similarly we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating if this were to happen it may increase the cost to the company of securing a replacement letterofcredit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained 

the impairment of financial institutions may adversely affect us we have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions including us and foreign commercial banks insurance companies investment banks investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade bankruptcy liquidity default or similar risks especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil a ratings downgrade bankruptcy receivership default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital liquidity position future business and results of operations 

our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all salaried us employees hired prior to july 1 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our us salaried and certain hourly employees our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily 

made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows financial conditions and results of operations 

our pension plans are currently underfunded and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans reducing the cash available for our business we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” at december 31 2008 was 32 billion although we expect to have no obligation to fund our plans in 2009 over the next several years we may make contributions to the plans that could be material the amount of such contributions will be dependent upon a number of factors principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the impact of possible funding relief legislation currently under consideration in the us congress 

changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse tax consequences fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the us dollar nationalization or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business our ability to refinance or repay our debt is dependent upon our ability to generate cash from operations and conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally as of december 31 2008 we had 16 billion of debt that had to be repaid or refinanced before 

  

december 31 2009 including 362 million of notes that matured in january 2009 and were repaid with cash on hand and a € 500 million approximately 696 million term loan due august 31 2009 that we are currently negotiating to refinance we have approximately 13 billion and 600 million in debt that matures in 2010 and 2011 respectively we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness if we use a substantial portion of our cash flow to repay indebtedness our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate may be limited this may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt similarly if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our debt or are unable to refinance our debt because credit market conditions remain volatile this may have an adverse impact on our cost of borrowing liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental health and safety laws and requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety there can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws and requirements including with global climate change laws and regulations will not require significant expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future unanticipated costs 

results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to our operations 

material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable 

rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results 

several of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit several of our operations particularly in emerging markets are carried on by joint ventures such as the ilim group in russia in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals strategies priorities or resources as we do in general joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all coowners rather than for our exclusive benefit operating a business as a joint 

  

venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as timeconsuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions in joint ventures we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our coowners as well as with the joint venture and if a coowner changes our relationship may be adversely affected in addition the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the coowners so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper’s operating results in 2008 reflected two distinct economic periods during the first three quarters business conditions were soft but steady sales volumes for containerboard and boxes were solid and paper and market pulp volumes while below prioryear levels were steady average price realizations increased for key products and market downtime was minimal while key input costs for raw materials and energy and freight costs increased significantly over the ninemonth period we were able to offset these effects with selling price increases solid manufacturing operations and continued cost reduction efforts 

beginning with the end of the third quarter us economic activity contracted significantly resulting in dramatic declines in demand for uncoated freesheet products corrugated boxes and market pulp global pulp prices began declining significantly and paper and containerboard pricing leveled out as they reached a 2008 peak with the significant drop in demand and international paper’s commitment to balance production with customer needs we took about one million tons of lackoforder downtime during the fourth quarter fortunately input costs also peaked and began to decline 

despite these severe unfavorable fourthquarter business conditions the company posted a 13 increase in net sales in 2008 to 248 billion and generated a record 27 billion of cash from continuing operations 

as we begin 2009 we expect that operating profits for the first quarter will be less than in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the size of the decline dependent upon the amount of downtime taken to match production with customer demand and upon changes in pricing and input costs sales volumes for our paper and packaging businesses are expected to be similar to fourthquarter levels we expect average sales price realizations for uncoated paper and containerboard to be under some pressure while us coated paperboard prices are expected to increase input costs for wood and energy and transportation costs should continue to decline although energy costs in europe and brazil are expected to increase planned mill maintenance outages will be higher in the united states but should remain about flat in europe and brazil earn 

ings from our ilim joint venture are expected to be below fourthquarter totals 

results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes equity earnings and minority interest interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in six segments printing papers industrial packaging consumer packaging distribution forest products and specialty businesses and other 

the following table shows the components of net earnings loss for each of the last three years 

 

  industry segment operating profits of 14 billion were 504 million lower in 2008 than in 2007 as the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs 721 million higher distribution costs 135 million lower sales volumes 85 million lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales 59 million and other items 57 million offset benefits from higher average prices 570 million and the net impact of cost reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 365 million additionally charges totaling 

  

382 million were recorded in 2008 industry segment operating profits for facility closures impairments and reorganization costs and charges related to the integration of the weyerhaeuser containerboard packaging and recycling cbpr business acquired in the 2008 third quarter 

the principal changes in 2008 operating profit by segment were as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 corporate items net of 103 million of expense in 2008 were lower than the 206 million of expense in 2007 due to lower pension expenses the decrease in 2007 versus 276 million of expense in 2006 reflects lower pension expenses partially offset by higher supply chain initiative costs 

corporate special items including impairments of goodwill restructuring and other charges and net losses gains on sales and impairments of businesses were a loss of 19 billion in 2008 compared with a gain of 241 million in 2007 and a gain of 24 billion in 2006 the loss in 2008 includes 18 billion of goodwill impairment charges and 179 million of restructuring and other charges the large gain in 2006 includes 48 billion from the sales of forestlands included in the 2006 transformation plan partially offset by 14 billion of net charges related to the divestiture of certain operations and 759 million of goodwill impairment charges 

interest expense net was 492 million in 2008 compared with 297 million in 2007 and 521 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 reflects the issuance of approximately 6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the cbpr business while the decrease in 2007 reflects lower average debt balances and lower interest rates from debt refinancings and repayments 

  

the 2008 income tax provision of 162 million includes a net 11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items the 2007 income tax provision of 415 million includes a 41 million benefit related to 2007 special tax adjustment items the 2006 income tax provision of 19 billion consists of 16 billion of deferred taxes principally reflecting deferred taxes on the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and a 300 million current tax provision and includes an 11 million charge related to 2006 special tax adjustment items excluding special items taxes as a percent of pretax earnings increased to 315 in 2008 from 30 in 2007 and 29 in 2006 reflecting a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 13 million of net adjustments were recorded relating to postclosing adjustments and estimates associated with prior sales of discontinued businesses 

during 2007 the company completed the sale of its wood products beverage packaging and kraft papers operations 

in the third quarter of 2006 international paper completed the sale of its brazilian coated papers business 

as a result of these actions the operating results of these businesses and the associated gainslosses on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2008 international paper generated 27 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 19 billion in 2007 capital spending from continuing operations for 2008 totaled 10 billion or 74 of depreciation and amortization expense cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled 61 billion principally for the acquisition of the cbpr business while issuances of debt totaled 60 billion principally for the cbpr acquisition our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 25 billion of unused committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

  

our focus in 2009 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms 

capital spending for 2009 is targeted at 700 million or about 43 of depreciation and amortization 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes 

legal 

an analysis of significant litigation activity is included in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

corporate overview 

while the operating results for international paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of businessspecific factors changes in international paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america europe russia latin america asia and north africa factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels and movements in currency exchange rates 

product prices are affected by general economic trends inventory levels currency movements and worldwide capacity utilization in addition to these revenuerelated factors net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs principally wood fiber and chemical costs energy costs freight costs salary and benefits costs including pensions and manufacturing conversion costs

industry segment operating profits 

industry segment operating profits of 14 billion in 2008 declined from both 19 billion in 2007 and 16 billion in 2006 the benefits of significantly higher 

average price realizations 570 million and lower operating costs lower mill outage costs and a more favorable mix of products sold 365 million were more than offset by higher energy and raw material costs 721 million higher freight costs 135 million lower sales volumes 85 million lower earnings from land and mineral sales 59 million higher costs related to special items 382 million and other items 57 million 

lackoforder downtime in 2008 increased significantly to approximately one million tons principally in the 2008 fourth quarter compared with 50000 tons in 2007 and 155000 tons in 2006 as the company adjusted production in line with its customer demand the 2008 total included approximately 105000 tons related to an uncoated paper machine at our franklin mill and pulp production at our louisiana mill prior to their permanent shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2008 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2009 industry segment operating profits are expected to be lower than fourthquarter 2008 earnings with the amount of the decline dependent upon the amount of downtime taken to match production with customer demand and upon changes in pricing and input costs sales volumes for our paper and packaging businesses are expected to be similar to 2008 fourthquarter levels as demand for industrial and consumer packaging is expected to remain essentially the same we expect average sales price realizations for uncoated paper and containerboard to be under some pressure while us coated paperboard price realizations are expected to increase reflecting the renegotiation of a number of large customer contracts in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 input costs for wood and energy and transportation should continue to decline although energy prices in europe and brazil are expected to increase planned mill maintenance outages will be higher in the us but will remain about flat in europe and brazil earnings from our ilim joint venture are expected to be lower than earnings reported in the fourth quarter reflecting weaker demand reduced selling prices and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact

industry segment results 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs and freight costs 

printing papers net sales for 2008 increased 4 from 2007 and 2 from 2006 however operating profits in 2008 were 44 lower than in 2007 and 5 higher than in 2006 benefits from higher average 

sales price realizations 344 million a favorable mix of products sold 54 million improved manufacturing operations 39 million and other items 11 million were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs 374 million higher freight costs 76 million and lower sales volumes and increased lackoforder downtime 103 million additionally 2008 results included a charge for costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the louisiana mill 123 million an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie scotland mill 107 million and a charge for costs associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill 30 million the printing papers segment took 635000 tons of downtime in 2008 largely in the fourth quarter including 305000 tons of lackoforder downtime to align production with customer demand this compared with 325000 tons of total downtime in 2007 of which 30000 tons related to lackoforders 

 

 north american printing papers net sales in 2008 were 34 billion compared with 35 billion in 2007 and 44 billion in 2006 35 billion excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business which was sold in the third quarter of 2006 sales volumes decreased in 2008 versus 2007 partially due to reduced production capacity resulting from the conversion of the louisiana mill to 100 pulp production in june 2008 and the conversion of the uncoated freesheet machine at the pensacola mill to linerboard production in the summer of 2007 average sales price realizations increased significantly reflecting benefits from price increases announced throughout 2008 operating earnings of 405 million in 2008 decreased from 415 million in 2007 but were higher than the 367 million earned in 2006 312 million excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business benefits from improved average sales price realizations were offset by the effects of higher input costs for wood energy and chemicals and higher freight costs mill operating costs were favorable compared with the prior year due primarily to the conversions of the highercost paper machines at the louisiana and pensacola mills and lower mill overhead spending and operating improvements planned maintenance downtime costs were lower in 2008 than in 2007 but lackoforder downtime increased to 135000 tons in 2008 from 25000 tons in 2007 in addition 2008 earnings included a 30 million charge for costs 

  

associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill 

sales volumes for the first quarter of 2009 are expected to decrease slightly from 2008 fourthquarter levels profit margins are expected to begin the quarter slightly above fourthquarter levels although margins later in the quarter may be affected by continued weak market demand planned maintenance outage costs should be lower as should raw material costs for wood and energy lackoforder downtime in the first quarter of 2009 is projected to be somewhat above fourthquarter 2008 levels 

brazilian papers net sales for 2008 of 950 million were higher than the 850 million in 2007 and the 495 million in 2006 compared with 2007 average sales price realizations improved significantly in both domestic and export markets sales volumes increased for both paper and pulp operating profits for 2008 of 186 million were up from 174 million in 2007 and 98 million in 2006 margins were favorably affected by a favorable mix of highermargin domestic sales but this benefit was partially offset by higher costs for planned mill maintenance downtime input costs increased significantly principally for electricity and natural gas earnings toward the end of 2008 benefited from favorable foreign exchange factors reflecting the 20 devaluation of the brazilian real in the third quarter 

entering 2009 sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper in the first quarter are expected to be seasonally lower profit margins are expected to be solid but below fourthquarter levels reflecting seasonal factors a less favorable product mix and increased input costs for electricity and chemicals 

european papers net sales in 2008 were 17 billion compared with 15 billion in 2007 and 13 billion in 2006 sales volumes in 2008 were higher than in 2007 reflecting pulp sales from our new bctmp facility in svetogorsk average sales price realizations increased significantly in 2008 in both eastern and western european markets operating profits were 39 million in 2008 compared with 171 million in 2007 and a loss of 45 million in 2006 that included a 128 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the saillat france mill earnings in 2008 included a 107 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie scotland mill to their estimated realizable value higher input costs for wood energy and freight more than offset the benefits from higher net sales lower planned mill maintenance outage costs and favorable manu 

facturing costs earnings in 2008 were also adversely affected by unfavorable foreign exchange movements 

looking ahead to 2009 firstquarter sales volumes are expected to be stronger in russia reflecting increased sales into western europe and seasonally higher in western europe profit margins are expected to be slightly below 2008 fourthquarter levels input costs are expected to increase particularly for energy costs in poland where electricity rates are increasing 33 and for chemicals planned maintenance outage costs will be slightly higher than in the 2008 fourth quarter 

asian printing papers net sales were approximately 20 million in both 2008 and 2007 compared with 15 million in 2006 operating earnings decreased slightly in 2008 compared with 2007 but were close to breakeven in all periods 

us market pulp sales in 2008 totaled 750 million compared with 655 million in 2007 and 510 million in 2006 sales volumes in 2008 were up from 2007 levels despite a decline in the fourth quarter reflecting the conversion of the bastrop louisiana mill to 100 pulp in june and the conversion of the riegelwood pulp dryer and finishing equipment to manufacture higher margin fluff versus market pulp average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2008 principally reflecting higher average prices earlier in the year for softwood hardwood and fluff pulp operating earnings in 2008 were a loss of 156 million including a charge of 123 million for costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the louisiana mill compared with earnings of 78 million in 2007 and 33 million in 2006 the benefits from higher average sales price realizations were more than offset by increased input costs for wood energy and chemicals and higher freight costs mill operating costs were also higher reflecting the increased production at the louisiana mill planned maintenance downtime costs were also higher yearoveryear and weak markets in the last four months of the year resulted in 135000 tons of additional lackoforder downtime for 2008 compared with 2007 

in the first quarter of 2009 market demand is expected to remain weak as a result prices for both market and fluff pulp may continue to be low costs will increase as a result of planned mill maintenance outages but input costs for wood and energy and for freight should be lower 

  

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production as well as with demand for processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging net sales for 2008 increased 47 to 77 billion compared with 52 billion in 2007 and 56 compared with 49 billion in 2006 operating profits in 2008 were 4 higher than in 2007 and 41 higher than in 2006 despite significant marketrelated downtime total yearoveryear shipments were higher due to the inclusion of the weyerhaeuser cbpr business acquired in the 2008 third quarter this net increase 51 million improved price realizations 228 million and a more favorable mix of products sold 19 million were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material and freight costs 235 million and higher other costs 2 million additionally costs related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard were lower in 2008 39 million operating earnings in 2008 also included a 39 million charge related to the writeup of the cbpr inventory to fair value and charges for integration costs associated with the cbpr acquisition 45 million the yearoveryear impact of the costs associated with the secondquarter 2008 vicksburg recovery boiler explosion net of insurance proceeds was negligible the segment took 11 million tons of downtime in 2008 which included 700000 tons of marketrelated downtime compared with 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of marketrelated downtime 

 

 north american industrial packaging net sales for 2008 were 62 billion compared with 39 billion in 2007 and 37 billion in 2006 operating profits in 2008 were 322 million up from 305 million in 2007 and 242 million in 2006 sales and profits for 2008 include the operating results of the weyerhaeuser cbpr business from the august 4 2008 acquisition date operating profits also reflect charges of 39 million related to the writeup of cbpr inventory to fair value and 45 million of cbpr integration costs 

  

excluding the effect of the cbpr acquisition containerboard and box shipments were lower in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting the economic downturn in the fourth quarter average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2007 benefiting from sales price increases implemented in late 2007 and during 2008 however the benefit of these higher sales prices was more than offset by higher average input costs for wood energy and chemicals freight costs also increased significantly yearoveryear manufacturing performance was strong and costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were lower lackoforder downtime totaled 700000 tons in 2008 including 355000 tons at cbpr facilities fourthquarter 2008 results included approximately 33 million of income related to the final insurance settlement for the vicksburg mill recovery boiler explosion operating results for 2007 included 52 million of costs incurred to convert the paper machine at the pensacola mill to the production of lightweight linerboard with an additional 13 million recorded in 2008 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2009 sales volumes for containerboard and boxes are expected to remain at about fourthquarter levels while profit margins should be comparable to fourthquarter levels planned mill maintenance outage costs should be higher in the first quarter of 2009 than in the fourth quarter of 2008 manufacturing operating costs are expected to be significantly lower principally for the box plants 

european industrial packaging net sales for 2008 were 12 billion up from 11 billion in 2007 and 10 billion in 2006 sales volumes declined primarily due to weaker markets for industrial products throughout europe operating profits in 2008 were 64 million compared with 67 million in 2007 and 37 million in 2006 earnings for the box business increased from the prior year with significant gains in france italy and spain sales margins improved reflecting strong average sales prices for boxes lower costs for kraft and recycled containerboard and the effects of waste reduction and box redesign initiatives conversion costs were unfavorable as inflationary cost increases more than offset the benefits of manufacturing improvement programs earnings from our joint venture in turkey were lower than in 2007 primarily due to weak general economic conditions 

entering the first quarter of 2009 sales volumes should be seasonally stronger as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues but industrial markets are expected to remain weak profit margins are 

  

expected to decline slightly reflecting some pressure on box prices and lower recycled board prices at the etienne mill 

asian industrial packaging net sales for 2008 were 350 million compared with 265 million in 2007 and 180 million in 2006 operating profits totaled 4 million in 2008 compared with 2 million in 2007 and a loss of 2 million in 2006 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

consumer packaging net sales increased 6 compared with 2007 and 19 compared with 2006 operating profits declined 85 from 2007 and 82 from 2006 levels benefits from improved average sales price realizations 93 million higher sales volumes for us european and asian coated paperboard 8 million and a favorable mix of products sold 19 million were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs 153 million increased freight costs 20 million unfavorable mill operations 14 million lower sales volumes for us converting businesses 5 million and other items 4 million additionally 2008 included 30 million of costs associated with the reorganization of the shorewood business compared with 11 million of reorganization charges in 2007 

 

 north american consumer packaging net sales were 25 billion in 2008 compared with 24 billion in both 2007 and 2006 operating earnings of 8 million in 2008 decreased from 70 million in 2007 and 64 million in 2006 

coated paperboard sales volumes were essentially flat in 2008 compared with 2007 average sales price realizations improved substantially in 2008 although these benefits were more than offset by higher raw material and freight costs however in the third and fourth quarters a number of large customer contracts were renegotiated to allow more timely future 

price adjustments to reflect changes in costs planned maintenance downtime expenses in 2008 were about flat compared with 2007 while manufacturing operating costs were unfavorable 

foodservice sales volumes were higher in 2008 than in 2007 average sales prices were also higher reflecting the realization of price increases implemented to recover raw material cost increases raw material costs for bleached board and polystyrene were significantly higher than in 2007 manufacturing costs improved reflecting increased productivity and reduced waste 

shorewood sales volumes in 2008 declined from 2007 levels due to weak demand in tobacco consumer products and display markets partially offset by improvements in the home entertainment segment sales margins improved from 2007 reflecting a more favorable mix of products sold raw material costs were higher in 2008 primarily for bleached board but operating costs were flat charges to restructure operations were 19 million higher in 2008 

entering 2009 coated paperboard sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be lower as downtime is taken to match production with customer demand average sales price realizations are expected to improve as 2008 pricing actions are realized earnings should benefit from fewer planned mill maintenance outages compared with the 2008 fourth quarter overall raw material costs for wood polyethylene and energy are expected to be about flat foodservice sales volumes are expected to improve slightly and average sales price realizations should be higher raw material costs particularly for resins should be significantly lower shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter 2009 are expected to seasonally decline but this negative impact should be partially offset by benefits from cost improvements associated with prioryear restructuring actions 

european consumer packaging net sales in 2008 were 300 million compared with 280 million in 2007 and 230 million in 2006 sales volumes in 2008 were higher than in 2007 as demand in domestic markets strengthened during the first three quarters of 2008 average sales price realizations also improved in 2008 primarily due to increased sales prices in european domestic markets operating earnings in 2008 of 22 million declined from 30 million in 2007 and 31 million in 2006 the additional contribution from higher net sales was more than offset by higher input costs for wood and 

  

energy higher freight costs and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates 

entering 2009 sales volumes for the first quarter should be comparable to the fourth quarter while average sales price realizations are expected to soften input costs are expected to increase primarily for electricity costs at the kwidzyn poland mill and for chemicals these factors should be somewhat offset by a favorable currency exchange rate movement in poland 

asian consumer packaging net sales were 390 million in 2008 compared with 330 million in 2007 and 50 million in 2006 reflecting the acquisition of a 50 ownership interest in international paper  sun cartonboard co ltd during the fourth quarter of 2006 operating earnings in 2008 were a loss of 13 million compared with earnings of 12 million in 2007 and a loss of 2 million in 2006 the loss in 2008 was primarily due to a 12 million charge to revalue pulp inventories at our shandong international paper and sun coated paperboard co ltd joint venture and startup costs associated with the joint venture’s new folding box board paper machine 

distribution 

our distribution business represented by our xpedx business markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in many business segments customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions although the commercial printing segment is also dependent on corporate advertising and promotional spending distribution’s margins and earnings are relatively stable across an operating cycle providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor additionally efficient customer service costeffective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability 

 

 distribution’s 2008 annual sales increased 9 from 2007 and 17 from 2006 while operating profits in 2008 decreased 5 compared with 2007 and increased 6 compared with 2006 

annual sales of printing papers and graphic arts supplies and equipment totaled 52 billion in 2008

total xpedx operating profit was 103 million in 2008 compared with 108 million in 2007 and 97 million in 2006 primarily reflecting lower demand for stock sales 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2009 sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonal declines and the weaker current economic conditions xpedx will continue to focus on efficiency and productivity initiatives to mitigate the effect of the demand decline 

forest products 

forest products currently manages approximately 200000 acres of forestlands in the united states operating results are driven by the timing and pricing of specific forestland tract sales the decline in sales reflects the significant decline in forestland acreage since 2006 future operations will continue to be driven by pricing and demand for forestland and real estate sales 

 

 

 sales in 2008 decreased 59 from 2007 and 74 from 2006 operating profits were down 11 from 2007 and 35 from 2006 as part of the company’s 2006 transformation plan 56 million acres of forestland were sold in 2006 primarily in the fourth quarter resulting in a significant decline in forestland acreage the company intends to focus future operations on maximizing the value from the sale of its remaining forestland and real estate properties 

  

operating profits in 2008 included 261 million from the sale of 13000 net acres of subsurface mineral rights in louisiana profits from stumpage sales and recreational income were 31 million in 2008 compared with 25 million in 2007 and 222 million in 2006 reflecting the significant reduction in forestland acreage profits from forestland and real estate sales were 144 million in 2008 compared with 469 million in 2007 and 571 million in 2006 operating expenses decreased to 27 million from 36 million in 2007 and 162 million in 2006 reflecting the reduced level of operations

repurchase option and a onetime 6 million aftertax charge reflecting the writeup of finished goods and workinprocess inventory to fair value as of the acquisition date in august 2008 ilim sold its 56 investment in the saint petersburg cartonboard and printing mill kpk for 238 million no gain or loss was realized by the company on the sale of kpk because the fair value assigned to that business by the company at the acquisition date was equal to the sales proceeds 

sales volumes for the joint venture were strong during the 12month period but declined slightly in august and september as demand weakened and the sale of the kpk facility was realized export sales to china during the period totaled over 900000 tons pulp and paper prices trended lower in the latter half of the year in both domestic and export sales reflecting weakening general economic conditions input costs for wood chemicals and energy increased gradually throughout the period declining volumes and supply chain improvements contributed to lower distribution costs the company received a 67 million cash dividend from the joint venture in december 2008 

for ilim’s 2008 fourth quarter to be reported in the company’s 2009 first quarter both sales volumes and sales price realizations are expected to be affected by weak global economic conditions production downtime may be taken as a result of weakening demand in addition a foreign exchange loss on us dollardenominated debt is expected due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the russian ruble

international paper has approximately 16 billion of debt and notes payable obligations maturing in 2009 in january 2009 the company used approximately 362 million of cash to repay its maturing 425 notes other debt obligations maturing in 2009 include 500 million of eurodenominated debt equivalent to 696 million at december 31 2008 that matures in august 2009 international paper is currently negotiating the refinancing of this eurodenominated debt 

the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2008 the company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion and a totaldebttocapital ratio of less than 60 at december 31 2008 international paper’s net worth as defined was 112 billion and the totaldebttocapital ratio was 519 net worth is defined in the covenants as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges the calculation also excludes other comprehensive income the totaldebttocapital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth 

the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary longterm funding not provided by operating cash flows funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives the primary goals of the company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense the majority of international paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors 

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper’s financing strategy at december 31 2008 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb negative outlook and baa3 negative outlook by sp and moody’s respectively the company currently has shortterm credit ratings of a3 and p3 by sp and moody’s respectively 

  

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

  

    pension obligations and funding 

at december 31 2008 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s us defined benefit plans determined under us generally accepted accounting principles was approximately 32 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets approximately 29 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements under current irs funding rules the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits the projected benefit obligation for accounting purposes in december 2008 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 wera was passed by the us congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company and the timing of its implementation as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding 

  

level at this time we do not expect that the finalization of the funded status as of december 31 2008 will require the company to make contributions to its plans in 2009 the timing and amount of contributions in 2010 and beyond which could be material will depend on a number of factors including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets changes in interest rates and the possible impact of other funding relief proposals that may be adopted by congress 

alternative fuel credits 

the us internal revenue code allows an excise tax credit for alternative fuel mixtures produced by a taxpayer for sale or for use as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business the credit equal to 50 per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture is refundable to the taxpayer during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company filed to be registered as an alternative fuel mixer and in january 2009 received notification that the registration was approved the company continues to accumulate information to file for refunds for eligible periods generally subsequent to november 2008 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas nos 132 and 132r “employers’ disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits” sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters 

are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel additionally as discussed in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data reserves for projected future claims settlements relating to exterior siding and roofing products previously manufactured by the company’s former masonite business require judgments regarding projections of future costs per claim international paper utilizes a third party consultant to assist in developing these estimates liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset group’s carrying amount cannot be recovered through future operations and exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is then recorded to reduce the carrying amount to fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value testing for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the amount and timing of these impairment charges require the estimation of future reporting unit cash flows costofcapital discount rates and the fair market value of the related business unit assets and liabilities 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules 

  

and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

goodwill impairment analysis under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a twostep process in the first step the fair value of the company’s reporting units is compared with their carrying value including goodwill if fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not considered to be impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any currently unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date once these fair values have been determined the implied fair value of the unit’s goodwill is calculated as the excess if any of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit through a goodwill impairment charge 

the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one the company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit over the estimated remaining useful operating lives of the unit’s assets discounted using the estimated costofcapital discount rate for 

each reporting unit these calculations require many estimates including discount rates future growth rates and cost and pricing trends for each reporting unit subsequent changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in future periods upon completion the resulting estimated fair values are then analyzed for reasonableness by comparing them to earnings multiples for historic industry business transactions and by comparing the sum of the reporting unit fair values and other corporate assets and liabilities divided by diluted common shares outstanding to the company’s market price per share on the analysis date 

during 2008 as in prior years the company performed the required annual goodwill testing for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter resulting in a 59 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill for the company’s european coated paperboard business subsequent to this testing date the company performed an interim test as of december 31 2008 and recalculated the estimated fair value of its reporting units as of that date using updated future cash flow projections and higher costofcapital discount rates based on this testing step two testing for possible impairment was required for the company’s us printing papers business and its us coated paperboard business based on management’s preliminary estimates an additional goodwill impairment charge of 379 million was recorded representing all of the goodwill for the us coated paperboard business as this was management’s best estimate of the minimum impairment charge that will be required upon the completion of detailed step two analyses in february 2009 based on additional work performed to date management determined that it was probable that all of the 13 billion of recorded goodwill for the us printing papers business would be impaired when testing is completed accordingly an additional goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion was recorded as a charge to operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 due to the complexity of the businesses involved it is expected that testing will be finalized for these businesses by the end of the first quarter of 2009 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used 

  

to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2008 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash payments are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives 

increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2009 pension expense by approximately 19 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approx 

imately 29 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately 9 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from oci into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 176 million and 29 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the decrease in 2008 us pension expense principally reflects an increase in the assumed discount rate to 620 in 2008 from 575 in 2007 and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses the decrease in 2007 us pension expense principally reflects lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses an increase in the assumed discount rate to 575 in 2007 from 550 in 2006 the earnings on 

  

the 10 billion contribution made to the plan during the fourth quarter of 2006 and a decrease in active participants due to divestitures 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2008 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

 a based on 123108 assumptions 

the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 245 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2009 with the increase from expense of 123 million in 2008 principally reflecting the additional employees of the cbpr business acquired in 2008 a lower return on asset assumption of 825 in 2009 from 850 in 2008 higher amortization of actuarial losses and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 600 in 2009 from 620 in 2008 net postretirement benefit costs in 2009 will increase primarily as a result of the expiration of prior service cost amortization credits from plan amendments made in prior years 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2008 totaled approximately 61 billion consisting of approximately 39 equity securities 39 debt securities and 22 real estate and other assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock 

the company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan tax deductibility the cash flows generated by the company and other factors the company expects to have no obligation to fund its domestic qualified plan in 2009 and made no contributions in 2008 the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions the nonqualified defined benefit plans are 

funded to the extent of benefit payments which totaled 24 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

accounting for stock options international paper adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” to account for stock options in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method under this method expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2008 251 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6669 per share at december 31 2007 280 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share 

income taxes 

the company’s effective income tax rates before minority interest equity earnings and discontinued operations were 14 25 and 59 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special and unusual items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur in those years excluding these special and unusual items the effective income tax rate for 2008 was 315 of pretax earnings compared with 30 in 2007 and 29 in 2006 the increases in the rate in 2008 and 2007 reflect a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2009 effective income tax rate will be approximately 3233 based on expected earnings and business conditions however tax incentives included in the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 could significantly reduce that tax rate

legal proceedings 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 27 million was spent in 2008 as planned for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 45 million in 2009 for similar capital projects the capital forecast for 2009 reflects increased spending at recently acquired facilities 8 million and completion of significant international environmental improvement projects 24 million 

amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental expenditures is approximately 36 million for 2010 and approximately 22 million for 

2011 the epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future requirements to our expenditure forecast 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances using presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 50 such sites and that its liability at 50 other sites is likely to be significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 100 matters is approximately 44 million 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at international paper current or former facilities and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 49 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of january 31 2009 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

climate change regulation 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of international national and subnational regulations proposed or implemented 

  

focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we currently have or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

in the united states the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in addition several states have already taken legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs also the us supreme court’s decision on april 2 2007 in massachusetts et al v epa  that greenhouse gases fall under the federal clean air act’s definition of “air pollutant” may result in future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under certain clean air act programs or other potential regulations passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various us states or the adoption of regulations by the environmental protection agency or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may have a material effect on our operations in the united states we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures compared with owners of comparable properties in the united states 

the european union under the kyoto protocol has committed to greenhouse gas reductions we believe that these measures will not have a material effect on our european operations in 2009 although they may have a material effect in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures compared with owners of comparable properties in the european union 

the framework of the kyoto protocol does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” brazil and china two countries where we have operations are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol although not subject to the kyoto protocol brazil and china may adopt greenhouse gas regulation in the future that may have a material effect on our operations in these countries 

regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in all countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this stage it is not possible to estimate either a timetable for the implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance 

  

other legal matters 

the company is involved in various inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property intellectual property environmental permits taxes personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments 

  

for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2008 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2008 and 2007 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 64 billion and 34 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 366 million and 150 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding 

energy hedge contracts at december 31 2008 and 2007 was approximately a 75 million liability and a 5 million liability respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 18 million and 19 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis by financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2008 and 2007 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 2 million asset and a 111 million asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 105 million and 91 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition these controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to such financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2008 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on page 49 management concluded that based on its assessment the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2008 

  

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit and finance committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of five independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw material and energy we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber caustic soda and polyethylene and energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing process our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

changes in transportation availability or costs our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both in the united states and internationally in the united states an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could negatively impact our financial results andor a reduction in transport availability in 

truck and rail could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner while we have benefited from supply chain initiatives that reduce usage and improve transportation availability there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 

competition we operate in a competitive environment both in the united states and internationally in all of our operating segments because our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share due to pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results 

product mix our results may be affected by a change in the company’s sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our financial results could be negatively impacted 

pricing our outlook assumes that we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as other price increases that we may in the future deem necessary andor appropriate delays in the realization of these price increases would negatively impact our financial results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position and our share of industry sales could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

demand for our products demand for our products is affected by general economic conditions in north america europe russia latin america asia and north africa changes in industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels interest rates and currency exchange rates may adversely affect our businesses and our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of 

  

the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

availability of credit the recent turmoil in the credit markets and the limited availability of credit may have a negative financial impact on some of our customers and potential buyers of our remaining forestlands this may affect the timing and amount of sales of our products and the timing of sales of our remaining forestlands 

pension and health care costs our pension and health care costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease pension costs 

changes in international conditions our financial results could be substantially affected by foreign market risks in the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse foreign tax consequences or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

changes in currency exchange rates we are impacted by the movement of various currencies relative to the us dollar from time to time we may hedge a portion of the risk from our transactions and commitments denominated in nonus dollar currencies when we deem it appropriate to do so there can be no assurance however that we will be able to fully protect ourselves against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to us and international laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing and new regulations including costs associated with global climate change regulation will not require significant capital expenditures or that existing reserves for specific matters will if regulations change be adequate to cover future unanticipated costs 

results of legal proceedings the costs and other effects of pending litigation against the company cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in item 3 legal proceedings contains management’s current view that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected 

risks relating to the company’s operations 

material disruptions of manufacturing we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

  

  

  

 any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products andor require us to make unplanned capital expenditures if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired resulting in lower sales and have a negative effect on our financial results 

ability to realize nonprice profit improvement the company has made a commitment to deliver on profit improvement initiatives including ongoing manufacturing supply chain and overhead cost reduction initiatives as well as volumemix improvements there can be no assurance that any or all of these profit improvements will be achieved 

this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook obvious general economic factors throughout the world such as inflation a sudden drop in consumer or business confidence or an unexpected collapse in stock markets do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the many contingencies that may cause our actual results to differ from those currently anticipated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper’s operating results in 2007 benefited from significantly higher paper and packaging price realizations sales volumes were slightly higher with growth in overseas markets partially offset by lower volumes in north america as we continued to balance our production with our customers’ demand operationally our pulp and paper and containerboard mills ran very well in 2007 however input costs for wood energy and transportation costs were all well above 2006 levels in our forest products business earnings decreased 31 reflecting a sharp decline in harvest income and a smaller drop in forestland and real estate sales both reflecting our forestland divestitures in 2006 interest expense decreased over 40 principally due to lower debt balances and interest rates from debt repayments and refinancings 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2008 we expect demand for north american printing papers and packaging to remain steady however if the economic downturn in 2008 is greater than expected this could have a negative impact on sales volumes and earnings some slight increases in paper and packaging price realizations are expected as we implement our announced price increases however first quarter earnings will reflect increased planned maintenance expenses and continued escalation of wood energy and transportation costs as a result excluding the impact of projected reduced earnings from land sales and the addition of equity earnings contributions from our recent investment in ilim holding sa in russia we expect 2008 firstquarter earnings to be lower than in the 2007 fourth quarter 

results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net earnings or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

international paper operates in six segments printing papers industrial packaging consumer packaging distribution forest products and specialty businesses and other 

the following table shows the components of net earnings for each of the last three years 

 

  industry segment operating profits of 24 billion were 349 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due principally to the benefits from higher average price realizations 461 million the net impact of cost reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable mix of products sold 304 million higher sales volumes 17 million lower special item costs 115 million and other items 4 million these benefits more than offset the impacts of higher energy raw material and freight costs 205 million higher costs for planned mill maintenance outages 48 million lower earnings from land sales 101 million costs at the pensacola mill associated with the conversion of a machine to the production of linerboard 52 million and reduced earnings due to net acquisitions and divestitures 146 million 

  

the principal changes in 2007 operating profit by segment were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 corporate items net of 732 million of expense in 2007 were lower than the 746 million of expense in 

2006 as lower pension expenses more than offset higher medical supply chain initiative and lifo inventory costs the increase in 2006 versus 607 million of expense in 2005 reflects higher pension benefitrelated and supply chain initiative costs partially offset by lower lifo inventory costs 

corporate special items including restructuring and other charges and net gains losses on sales and impairments of businesses were a gain of 241 million in 2007 compared with a gain of 24 billion in 2006 and an expense of 134 million in 2005 the large gain in 2006 includes 48 billion from the sales of forestlands included in our transformation plan partially offset by 14 billion of net charges related to the divestiture of certain operations and 759 million of goodwill impairment charges 

interest expense net of 297 million in 2007 decreased from 521 million in 2006 and 595 million in 2005 reflecting lower average debt balances and lower interest rates from debt refinancings and repayments made under the company’s transformation plan 

the 2007 income tax provision of 415 million includes a 41 million benefit related to 2007 special tax adjustment items the 2006 income tax provision of 19 billion consists of 16 billion of deferred taxes principally reflecting deferred taxes on the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and a 03 billion current tax provision and includes an 11 million charge related to 2006 special tax adjustment items the 407 million benefit in 2005 includes a 454 million tax benefit related to 2005 special tax adjustment items excluding special items taxes as a percent of pretax earnings increased to 30 in 2007 and 29 in 2006 from 20 in 2005 reflecting a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 

discontinued operations 

during 2007 the company completed the sale of its wood products beverage packaging and kraft papers operations

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2007 international paper generated 19 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 10 billion in 2006 the 2006 amount is net of a 10 billion voluntary pension plan cash contribution capital spending from continuing operations for 2007 totaled 13 billion or 119 of depreciation and amortization expense cash proceeds from divestitures totaled 17 billion with 300 million used for acquisitions and 600 million invested in a 50 equity interest in ilim holding sa in russia we repaid approximately 900 million of debt during the year our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 25 billion of unused committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future shortterm liquidity requirements maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

our focus in 2008 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms 

capital spending for 2008 is targeted at 11 billion or about equal to depreciation and amortization 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes 

pension expenses for our us plans decreased to 210 million in 2007 from 377 million in 2006 reflecting a full year of earnings on a 10 billion contribution made to the plan during the fourth quarter of 2006 lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and an increase in the assumed discount rate to 575 in 2007 from 550 in 2006 an additional decrease to approximately 114 million is expected in 2008 reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate to 620 and a further reduction of amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses our pension funding policy continues to be at a 

minimum to fully fund actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa unless changes are made to our funding policy it is unlikely that any contributions to our us qualified plan will be required in 2008

industry segment results 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency raw material and energy costs and freight costs 

printing papers net sales for 2007 decreased 3 from 2006 and 6 from 2005 due principally to the sale of the us coated papers business in the third quarter of 2006 however operating profits in 2007 were 73 higher than in 2006 and more than double profits in 2005 compared with 2006 earnings improved for all businesses in the segment benefits from higher average sales price realizations in the united states europe and brazil 353 million improved manufacturing operations 92 million higher sales volumes in brazil europe and us market pulp 30 million and the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions 19 million were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 95 million higher freight costs 10 million lower sales volumes in us uncoated papers 40 million and other items 12 million additionally 2006 results included an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the saillat france mill 128 million compared with 2005 earnings in 2007 were also higher in all businesses the printing papers segment took 325000 tons of downtime in 2007 including 30000 tons of lackoforder downtime to align production with 

  

customer demand this compared with 555000 tons of total downtime in 2006 of which 150000 tons related to lackoforders 

 

 north american printing papers net sales in 2007 were 35 billion compared with 44 billion in 2006 35 billion excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business and 48 billion in 2005 32 billion excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business sales volumes decreased in 2007 versus 2006 partially due to reduced production capacity resulting from the conversion of the paper machine at the pensacola mill to the production of lightweight linerboard for our industrial packaging segment average sales price realizations increased significantly reflecting benefits from price increases announced throughout 2007 lackoforder downtime declined to 27000 tons in 2007 from 40000 tons in 2006 operating earnings of 537 million in 2007 increased from 482 million in 2006 407 million excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business and 175 million in 2005 74 million excluding the coated and supercalendered papers business the benefits from improved average sales price realizations more than offset the effects of higher input costs for wood energy and freight mill operations were favorable compared with the prior year due to currentyear improvements in machine performance and energy conservation efforts 

sales volumes for the first quarter of 2008 are expected to increase slightly and the mix of products sold to improve demand for printing papers in north america was steady as the quarter began price increases for cutsize paper and roll stock have been announced that are expected to be effective principally late in the first quarter planned mill maintenance outage costs should be about the same as in the fourth quarter however raw material costs are expected to continue to increase primarily for wood and energy 

brazilian papers net sales for 2007 of 850 million were higher than the 495 million in 2006 and the 465 million in 2005 compared with 2006 average sales price realizations improved reflecting price increases for uncoated freesheet paper realized during the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 excluding the impact of the luiz antonio acquisition 

sales volumes increased primarily for cut size and offset paper operating profits for 2007 of 246 million were up from 122 million in 2006 and 134 million in 2005 as the benefits from higher sales prices and favorable manufacturing costs were only partially offset by higher input costs contributions from the luiz antonio acquisition increased net sales by approximately 350 million and earnings by approximately 80 million in 2007 

entering 2008 sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper and pulp should be seasonally lower average price realizations should be essentially flat but margins are expected to reflect a less favorable product mix energy costs primarily for hydroelectric power are expected to increase significantly reflecting a lack of rainfall in brazil in the latter part of 2007 

european papers net sales in 2007 were 15 billion compared with 13 billion in 2006 and 12 billion in 2005 sales volumes in 2007 were higher than in 2006 at our eastern european mills reflecting stronger market demand and improved efficiencies but lower in western europe reflecting the closure of the marasquel mill in 2006 average sales price realizations increased significantly in 2007 in both eastern and western european markets operating profits of 214 million in 2007 increased from a loss of 16 million in 2006 and earnings of 88 million in 2005 the loss in 2006 reflects the impact of a 128 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the saillat france mill excluding this charge the improvement in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects the contribution from higher net sales partially offset by higher input costs for wood energy and freight 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 sales volumes are expected to be stable in western europe but seasonally weaker in eastern europe and russia average price realizations are expected to remain about flat wood costs are expected to increase especially in russia due to strong demand ahead of tariff increases and energy costs are anticipated to be seasonally higher 

asian printing papers net sales were approximately 20 million in 2007 compared with 15 million in 2006 and 10 million in 2005 operating earnings increased slightly in 2007 but were close to breakeven in all periods 

us market pulp sales in 2007 totaled 655 million compared with 510 million and 525 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively sales volumes in 2007 were up from 2006 levels primarily for paper and 

  

tissue pulp due to strong market demand particularly from asia average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood hardwood and fluff pulp operating earnings in 2007 were 104 million compared with 48 million in 2006 and 37 million in 2005 the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy chemicals and freight 

entering the first quarter of 2008 demand for market pulp remains strong and average sales price realizations should increase slightly however input costs for energy chemicals and freight are expected to be higher and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production as well as with demand for processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6 to 52 billion compared with 49 billion in 2006 and 13 compared with 46 billion in 2005 operating profits in 2007 were 26 higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings benefits from improved price realizations 147 million sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime 3 million a more favorable mix 31 million strong mill and converting operations 33 million and other costs 47 million were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs 76 million and higher freight costs 18 million in addition a gain of 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of marketrelated downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was marketrelated 

 

   

north american industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were 39 billion compared with 37 billion in 2006 and 36 billion in 2005 operating profits in 2007 were 407 million up from 327 million in 2006 and 170 million in 2005 

containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 margins improved reflecting stronger export demand manufacturing performance was strong although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages raw material costs for wood energy chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine 

us converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand earnings improvement in 2007 benefited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 sales volumes are expected to increase slightly and results should benefit from a fullquarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 however additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter and freight and input costs are expected to rise particularly for wood and energy manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter 

european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were 11 billion up from 10 billion in 2006 and 880 million in 2005 sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year operating profits in 2007 were 88 million compared with 69 million in 2006 and 53 million in 2005 sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs 

entering the first quarter of 2008 sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues profit margins however are expected to be somewhat lower 

  

asian industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were 265 million compared with 180 million in 2006 in 2005 net sales were 105 million subsequent to international paper’s acquisition of a majority interest in this business in august 2005 operating profits totaled 6 million in 2007 and 3 million in 2006 compared with a loss of 4 million in 2005 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs freight costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

consumer packaging net sales increased 12 compared with 2006 and 24 compared with 2005 operating profits rose 15 from 2006 and 24 from 2005 levels benefits from improved average sales price realizations 52 million higher sales volumes for us and european coated paperboard 9 million favorable mill operations 14 million and contributions from international paper  sun cartonboard co ltd acquired in 2006 16 million were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 53 million an unfavorable mix of products sold 4 million increased freight costs 5 million and other costs 3 million 

 

 north american consumer packaging net sales were 24 billion in both 2007 and 2006 compared with 22 billion in 2005 operating earnings of 143 million in 2007 improved from 129 million in 2006 and 121 million in 2005 

coated paperboard sales volumes increased in 2007 compared with 2006 particularly for folding carton board reflecting improved demand average sales price realizations substantially improved in 2007 for both folding carton board and cup stock the impact of the higher sales prices combined with improved manufacturing performance at our mills more than offset the negative effects of higher wood and energy costs 

foodservice sales volumes were slightly higher in 2007 than in 2006 average sales prices were also higher reflecting the realization of price increases 

implemented to recover raw material cost increases in addition a more favorable mix of hot cups and food containers led to higher average margins raw material costs for bleached board and polystyrene were higher than in 2006 but these increases were partially offset by improved manufacturing costs reflecting increased productivity and reduced waste 

shorewood sales volumes in 2007 declined from 2006 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment tobacco and display markets although demand was stronger in the consumer products segment sales margins declined from 2006 reflecting a less favorable mix of products sold raw material costs were higher for bleached board but this impact was more than offset by improved manufacturing operations and lower operating costs charges to restructure operations also impacted 2007 results 

entering 2008 coated paperboard sales volumes are expected to be about even with the fourth quarter of 2007 while average sales price realizations are expected to slightly improve earnings should benefit from fewer planned mill maintenance outages compared with the 2007 fourth quarter however costs for wood polyethylene and energy are expected to be higher foodservice results are expected to benefit from increased sales volumes and higher sales price realizations shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter 2008 are expected to seasonally decline but this negative impact should be partially offset by benefits from cost improvements associated with prioryear restructuring actions 

european consumer packaging net sales in 2007 were 280 million compared with 230 million in 2006 and 190 million in 2005 sales volumes in 2007 were higher than in 2006 reflecting stronger market demand and improved productivity at our kwidzyn mill average sales price realizations also improved in 2007 operating earnings in 2007 of 37 million declined from 41 million in 2006 and 39 million in 2005 the additional contribution from higher net sales was more than offset by higher input costs for wood energy and freight 

entering 2008 sales volumes and prices are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter machine performance and sales mix are expected to improve however wood costs are expected to be higher especially in russia due to strong demand ahead of tariff increases and energy costs are anticipated to be seasonally higher 

  

asian consumer packaging net sales were 330 million in 2007 compared with 50 million in 2006 which reflects the acquisition of a 50 ownership interest in international paper  sun cartonboard co ltd during the fourth quarter of 2006 operating earnings in 2007 were 18 million and 2 million in 2006 

distribution 

our distribution business represented by our xpedx business markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in many business segments customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions although the commercial printing segment is also dependent on corporate advertising and promotional spending distribution earnings and cash flows are typically stable providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor additionally efficient customer service costeffective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability 

 

 distribution’s 2007 annual sales including acquisitions increased 8 from 2006 and 15 from 2005 while operating profits in 2007 increased 14 and 74 compared with 2006 and 2005 respectively 

annual sales of printing papers and graphic arts supplies and equipment totaled 47 billion in 2007 compared with 43 billion in 2006 and 41 billion in 2005 reflecting an increased focus on the publication and catalogue markets revenues for mill direct sales were up 19 from 2006 and 25 from 2005 stock sales were up 3 from 2006 and 10 from 2005 trade margins for printing papers decreased from 2006 and 2005 reflecting an increase in lower margin direct sales the sales increases also reflect contributions from the august 2007 central lewmar acquisition revenue from packaging products was 15 billion for 2007 substantially unchanged from 2006 revenues and up from 14 billion in 2005 trade margins for packaging products increased in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 reflecting a more favorable product mix facility supplies annual revenue was 11 billion in 2007 compared to 10 billion in 2006 and 941 million in 2005 principally reflecting increased sales volume trade margins for 2007 decreased compared with 2006 and 2005 as a 

result of a less favorable mix of products sold operating profit was 146 million in 2007 compared to 128 million in 2006 and 84 million in 2005 higher revenues were the primary factor in the operating profit improvement 

looking ahead to the first quarter 2008 sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower however reductions in operating expenses should partially offset the effect of this decline on operating profits 

forest products 

forest products currently manages approximately 300000 acres of forestlands in the united states forest resources operating results have historically been largely driven by demand and pricing for softwood sawtimber and to a lesser extent for softwood pulpwood by the volume of merchantable timber harvested from company forestlands and by demand and pricing for specific forestland tracts offered for sale however with the significant decline in forestland acreage due to sales of forestlands under the company’s transformation plan in 2006 future operations will be largely driven by pricing and demand for real estate and forestland sales 

 

 sales in 2007 decreased 37 from 2006 and 51 from 2005 operating profits were down 31 from 2006 and 35 from 2005 as part of the company’s announced transformation plan 56 million acres of forestland were sold in 2006 primarily in the fourth quarter resulting in a significant decline in forestland acreage the company intends to focus future operations on maximizing the value from the sale of its remaining forestland and real estate properties 

operating profits from stumpage sales and recreational income were 25 million in 2007 compared with 222 million in 2006 and 269 million in 2005 reflecting the significant reduction in forestland acreage operating profits from forestland sales were 437 million in 2007 compared with 447 million in 2006 and 400 million in 2005 operating 

  

expenses decreased to 23 million from 115 million in 2006 and 146 million in 2005 reflecting the reduced level of operations operating profits for the real estate division which principally sells higherandbetteruse properties were 32 million 124 million and 198 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

looking forward to 2008 operating profits are expected to decline significantly reflecting the reduced level of forestland holdings operating earnings will primarily reflect the periodic sales of remaining acreage and can be expected to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of sale transactions 

specialty businesses and other 

the specialty businesses and other segment principally includes the operating results of the arizona chemical business as well as certain smaller businesses the arizona chemical business was sold in february 2007 thus operating results in 2007 reflect only two months of activity 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy raw material and transportation costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america 

financing activities in 2007 continued the focus on the transformation plan objectives of returning value to shareholders through additional repurchases of common stock and strengthening the balance sheet through further reductions of debt 

  

management believes it is important for international paper to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms at december 31 2007 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa3 stable outlook by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s investor services moody’s respectively

the following table presents capital spending from continuing operations by each of our business segments for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 

“employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas nos 132 and 132r “employers’ disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits” sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel additionally as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data reserves for projected future claims settlements relating to exterior siding and roofing products previously manufactured by the company’s former masonite business require judgments regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts international paper utilizes a third party consultant to assist in developing these estimates liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with interna 

  

tional paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in its income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome such as settlement with the relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2007 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

   

the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500550 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash flows are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2008 pension expense by approximately 20 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 29 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately 11 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from oci into net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans over the next fiscal year are 119 million and 28 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the decrease in 2007 us pension expense principally reflects lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses an increase in the assumed discount rate to 575 in 2007 from 550 in 2006 the earnings on the 10 billion contribution made to the plan during the fourth quarter of 2006 and a decrease in active participants due to divestitures the increase in 2006 us pension expense was principally due to a change in the mortality assumption to use the retirement protection act 2000 tables and the use of a lower assumed discount rate 

  

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2007 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

 a based on 123107 assumptions 

the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 114 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2008 with the decrease from expense of 210 million in 2007 principally reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate to 620 in 2008 from 575 in 2007 and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses net postretirement benefit costs in 2008 will increase primarily as a result of increased amortization due to 2007 sales and divestiture activity which accelerated recognition of amortization credits demographic assumption changes which reflected the results of an experience study including the use of earlier assumed retirement ages and a change to a higher medical trend assumption 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2007 totaled approximately 85 billion consisting of approximately 59 equity securities 31 debt securities and 10 real estate and other assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock 

international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa international paper made voluntary contributions of 10 billion to the qualified defined benefit plan in the fourth quarter of 2006 no contributions were made in 2007 nor are any contributions anticipated in 2008 the nonqualified plan is only funded to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be 27 million in 2008 

accounting for stock options international paper adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” to account for 

  

stock options in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method under this method expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2007 28 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share at december 31 2006 36 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share 

income taxes 

before minority interest and discontinued operations the company’s effective income tax rates were 25 59 and 142 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special and unusual items that can affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur in those years excluding these special and unusual items the effective income tax rate for 2007 was 30 of pretax earnings compared with 29 in 2006 and 20 in 2005 the increase in the rate in 2007 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2008 effective income tax rate will be 3233 based on expected earnings and business conditions which are subject to change

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax returns specifically the financial statement effects of a tax position may be recognized only when it is determined that it is “more likely than not” that based on its technical merits the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority the amount recognized shall be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits that exceed a 50 probability of being recognized this interpretation also expands income tax disclosure requirements international paper applied the provisions of this interpretation beginning in the first quarter of 2007 the adoption of this interpretation resulted in a charge to the beginning balance of retained earnings of 94 million at the date of adoption 

accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments – an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” which provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no 133 this statement allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety with changes in fair value recognized in earnings this statement was effective for international paper for all financial instruments acquired issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after january 1 2007 the adoption of sfas no 155 in 2007 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” this interpretation clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in fasb statement no 143 refers to the fact that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation international paper adopted the provisions of this interpretation in the fourth quarter of 2005 with no material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

the company’s principal conditional asset retirement obligations relate to the potential future closure or redesign of certain of its production facilities in connection with any such activity it is possible that the company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from the facilities or to remediate in accordance with federal and state laws that govern the handling of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations at this time any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date and the company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expectedpresentvalue technique to estimate any such potential obligations accordingly the company does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation 

implicit variable interests in march 2005 the fasb issued fsp fin 46r5 “implicit variable interests under fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities” this fsp states that implicit variable interests are implied financial interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets exclusive of variable interests an implicit variable interest acts the same as an explicit variable interest 

except it involves the absorbing and or receiving of variability indirectly from the entity rather than directly the identification of an implicit variable interest is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances international paper adopted the provisions of fsp fin 46r5 in the second quarter of 2005 with no material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations in all other jurisdictions in which we operate our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 59 million was spent in 2007 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste including the costs to comply with the environmental protection agency’s epa cluster rule and industrial boiler mact regulations we expect to spend approximately 27 million in 2008 for similar capital projects amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental appropriations during the year 2009 is approximately 26 million and during the year 2010 is approximately 31 million this reduced capital forecast for 2008 2009 and 2010 reflects the reduction in cluster rule spending and completion of significant international environmental improvement projects which accounted for 15 million of the 2007 spending 

the epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future cost requirements to our expenditure forecast international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla 

  

most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances and on presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 45 such sites and that its liability at 47 sites is likely to be significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 92 matters is approximately 38 million 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at international paper current or former facilities are recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 46 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of january 31 2008 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

international paper is involved in other contractual disputes administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types 

climate change regulation 

since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the kyoto protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations there have been a range of national subnational and international regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction these actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we currently have interests or may in the future have manufacturing facilities or investments 

in the united states the us congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in addition several states have 

already taken legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by companies and public utilities primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs also the us supreme court’s decision on april 2 2007 in massachusetts et al v epa  that greenhouse gases fall under the federal clean air act’s definition of “air pollutant” may result in future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under certain clean air act programs or other potential regulations passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various states of the us or the adoption of regulations by the environmental protection agency or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may have a material effect on our operations in the united states we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared to typical owners of comparable properties in the united states 

the european union under the kyoto protocol has committed to greenhouse gas reductions we believe that these measures will not have a material effect on our european operations in 2008 although they may have a material effect in the future we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared to typical owners of comparable properties in the european union 

the framework of the kyoto protocol does not apply to “underdeveloped nations” brazil and china two countries where we have operations are considered underdeveloped nations by the kyoto protocol although not subject to the kyoto protocol brazil and china may adopt greenhouse gas regulation in the future that may have a material effect on our operations in these countries 

regulation of greenhouse gases continues to evolve in all countries in which we do business while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to greenhouse gases and climate change at this stage it is not possible to estimate either a timetable for implementation of any new regulations or our costs of compliance 

other legal matters 

the company is involved in various inquiries administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property environmental permits taxes personal injury labor and employment and other matters some of which allege substantial 

  

monetary damages while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened other than those that cannot be assessed due to their preliminary nature or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2007 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was immaterial 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s targeted capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement this capital structure at december 31 2007 and 2006 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 34 billion and 38 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 150 million and 133 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts at december 31 2007 and 2006 was approximately a 5 million and a 12 million liability respectively at december 31 2005 the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts was immaterial the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 19 million and 10 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis through financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2007 and 2006 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 111 million asset and a 95 million asset respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 91 million and 43 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition these controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

   

  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to such financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding the company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2007 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on page 45 management concluded that based on its assessment the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2007 

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee has audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics 

  

program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of five independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

during the 2007 first quarter the company completed the noncash exchange of assets for the luiz antonio mill in brazil integration activities including an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting are currently in process and are expected to be completed in early 2008

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy  we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber caustic soda and polyethylene and energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing process our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases and productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

changes in transportation availability or costs  our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally in the united states an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could adversely affect our earnings andor a reduction in transport availability in truck and rail could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner while we have benefited from supplychain initiatives that reduce usage and improve transportation availability there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 

competition  we face intense competition both domestically and internationally for our products in all of our operating segments because our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share due to pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our revenues and financial results 

product mix  our results may be affected by a change in the company’s sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

  

pricing  our outlook assumes that we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as other price increases that we may in the future deem necessary andor appropriate delays in the realization of these price increases would negatively impact our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position and our share of industry sales could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

demand for our products  demand for our products is affected by general economic conditions in north america europe latin america and asia changes in industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels interest rates and currency exchange rates may adversely affect our businesses and our financial results 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy our debt ratings are from time to time reviewed by the rating organizations and remain subject to change and a downgrade in rating of our debt could increase our interest cost and negatively affect our earnings 

pension and health care costs  our pension and health care costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease pension costs 

natural disasters  the occurrence of a natural disaster such as a hurricane tropical storm earthquake tornado flooding or other unanticipated problems could cause operational disruptions which could impair our profitability 

changes in international conditions  our results could be substantially affected by foreign market risks in the countries in which we have 

  

manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland and china where substantial manufacturing facilities exist are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world downturns in economic activity adverse foreign tax consequences or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

changes in currency exchange rates  we are impacted by the movement of various currencies relative to the us dollar from time to time we may hedge a portion of the risk from our transactions and commitments denominated in nonus dollar currencies when we deem it appropriate to do so there can however be no assurance that we will be able to fully protect ourselves against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

risks relating to the company’s transformation plan 

the ability to successfully execute sales transactions currently under contract  the company’s ability to successfully execute sales transactions under contract including contracts executed pursuant to the transformation plan and to realize the anticipated sales proceeds is dependent upon many factors including the ability to successfully consummate the transactions without a purchase price adjustment the successful fulfillment or waiver of all conditions set forth in the sales agreements and the successful closing of the transactions within the estimated timeframes 

the ability to invest proceeds with attractive financial returns  the company will selectively seek attractive investment opportunities for a portion of the proceeds from divestitures the company may be unable to identify and negotiate acceptable investments with attractive returns 

ability to realize anticipated profit improvement from the transformation plan  the profitability of the company’s two platform businesses uncoated papers including distribution and packaging is subject to variable demand and the company’s ability to execute internal profit improvement initiatives including ongoing manufacturing supply chain and overhead cost reduction initiatives as well as volumemix improvements there can be no assurance that profit improvements will be achieved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper’s operating results in 2006 benefited from strong gains in pricing and sales volumes and lower operating costs our average paper and packaging prices in 2006 increased faster than our costs for the first time in four years the improvement in sales volumes reflects increased uncoated papers corrugated box coated paperboard and european papers shipments as well as improved revenues from our xpedx distribution business our manufacturing operations also made solid cost reduction improvements lower interest expense reflecting debt repayments in 2005 and 2006 was also a positive factor together these improvements more than offset the effects of continued high raw material and distribution costs lower real estate sales higher net corporate expenses and lower contributions from businesses and forestlands divested during 2006 

looking forward to 2007 we expect seasonally higher sales volumes in the first quarter average paper price realizations should continue to improve as we implement previously announced price increases in europe and brazil input costs for energy fiber and chemicals are expected to be mixed although slightly higher in the first quarter operating results will benefit from the recently completed international papersun paperboard joint ventures in china and the addition of the luiz antonio paper mill to our operations in brazil however primarily as a result of lower real estate sales in the first quarter we anticipate earnings from continuing operations will be somewhat lower than in the 2006 fourth quarter 

significant steps were also taken in 2006 in the execution of the company’s transformation plan we completed the sales of our us and brazilian coated papers businesses and 56 million acres of us forestlands and announced definitive sale agreements for our kraft papers beverage packaging and arizona chemical businesses and a majority of our wood products business all expected to close during 2007 through december 31 2006 we have received approximately 97 billion of the estimated proceeds from divestitures announced under this plan of approximately 113 billion with the balance to be received as the remaining divestitures are completed in the first half of 2007 we have strengthened our balance sheet by 

reducing debt by 62 billion and returned value to our shareholders by repurchasing 397 million shares of our common stock for approximately 14 billion we made a 10 billion voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension fund we have identified selective reinvestment opportunities totaling approximately 20 billion including opportunities in china brazil and russia finally we remain focused on our threeyear 12 billion target for nonprice profitability improvements with 330 million realized during 2006 while more remains to be done in 2007 we have made substantial progress toward achieving the objectives announced at the outset of the plan in july 2005 

results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in six segments printing papers industrial packaging consumer packaging distribution forest products and specialty businesses and other 

the following table shows the components of net earnings loss for each of the last three years 

 

 

  

industry segment operating profits of 21 billion were 452 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due principally to the benefits from higher average prices 476 million higher sales volumes 143 million and cost reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 187 million which more than offset the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs 101 million lower earnings from land sales 27 million higher distribution costs 113 million reduced earnings due to the sale of the coated and supercalendered papers business and loss of harvest income from our divested forestlands 53 million and other items 60 million 

segment operating profits 

in millions 

the principal changes in operating profits by segment were as follows 

 

  

  



  

  

  

 corporate items net of 746 million of expense in 2006 were higher than the 607 million of expense in 2005 and 477 million of expense in 2004 due to higher pension expenses benefitsrelated expenses and supply chain initiative costs partially offset by lower inventoryrelated costs 

corporate special items including gains on sales of forestlands restructuring and other charges losses on sales and impairments of businesses impairments of goodwill insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required increased to a gain of 24 billion from an expense of 134 million in 2005 and an expense of 141 million in 2004 the increase in 2006 principally reflects 48 billion of gains on the sales of forestlands included in our transformation plan partially offset by 14 billion of net charges related to the divestiture of certain operations principally the us coated and supercalendered papers business and 759 million of goodwill impairment charges 

interest expense net of 521 million in 2006 decreased from 595 million in 2005 and 712 million in 2004 reflecting lower average debt balances from repayments made under the company’s transformation plan and lower interest rates from debt refinancings and repayments additionally the 2006 total includes a pretax credit of 6 million for interest received from the canadian government on refunds of prioryear softwood lumber duties interest expense net in 2005 includes a pretax credit of 43 million related to an agreement reached with the internal revenue service concerning the company’s 1997 through 2000 federal income tax audits and a pretax credit of 11 million related to the collection of a note receivable from the 2001 sale of the flexible packaging business 

  

the 2006 income tax provision of 19 billion consists of 16 billion of deferred taxes principally reflecting deferred taxes on the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and a 03 billion current tax provision the tax provision also includes an 11 million charge related to 2006 special tax adjustment items the 407 million benefit in 2005 included a 454 million tax benefit related to 2005 special tax adjustment items the tax provision of 114 million in 2004 included 32 million of expense related to special items see “income taxes” on page 19 for a further discussion of these items 

discontinued operations 

in the first quarter of 2006 management determined that the future sale of the kraft papers business was in the best interest of the company’s shareholders a definitive agreement to sell this business was signed during the second quarter in the third quarter international paper completed the sale of its brazilian coated papers business during the fourth quarter international paper determined that the sales of its beverage packaging and wood products businesses were in the best interests of the shareholders a definitive agreement to sell its beverage packaging business was announced during the quarter and the company announced two separate definitive agreements to sell 13 lumber mills and five wood products plants 

during the 2005 third quarter international paper completed the sale of the carter holt harvey limited business during 2004 international paper completed the sale of its weldwood of canada limited business in the fourth quarter 

as a result of these actions the operating results of these businesses and the associated gainslosses on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2006 international paper generated 10 billion of cash flow from continuing operations compared with 12 billion in 2005 the 2006 amount is net of a 10 billion voluntary pension plan cash contribution capital spending from continuing operations for the year totaled 10 billion or 87 of depreciation and amortization expense we repaid approximately 52 billion of debt during the year including various higher couponrate debt that will result in lower interest charges in future years our liquidity position remains strong supported by 

approximately 30 billion of unused committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future shortterm liquidity requirements maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

our focus in 2007 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity 

capital spending for 2007 is targeted at 12 billion or about equal to estimated depreciation and amortization 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes 

in recent years the assumption estimates used for pensions have resulted in increases in reported pension charges pension expenses for our us plans increased to 377 million in 2006 from 243 million in 2005 due principally to a change in the mortality assumption and the use of a lower assumed discount rate a decrease of approximately 182 million is expected in 2007 reflecting earnings on the 10 billion voluntary cash contribution made by the company in 2006 and an increase in the assumed discount rate our pension funding policy continues to be at a minimum to fully fund actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa unless changes are made to our funding policy it is unlikely that any contributions to our us qualified plan will be required in 2007

industry segment operating profits 

industry segment operating profits of 21 billion in 2006 improved from both the 16 billion in 2005 and the 17 billion in 2004 the benefits of significantly 

  

higher sales price realizations 476 million increased sales volumes including the impact of reduced lackoforder downtime in our us containerboard coated paperboard and uncoated papers businesses 143 million the favorable impacts of cost reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 187 million and other items 15 million were partially offset by higher energy wood and other raw material costs 101 million higher freight costs 113 million lower earnings from forestland and real estate sales 27 million and an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the saillat france mill 128 million 

lackoforder downtime in 2006 totaled approximately 155000 tons compared with 830000 tons in 2005 and 70000 tons in 2004 as the company adjusted production in line with customer demand the 2005 total included approximately 290000 tons related to uncoated paper machines at our mills in pensacola florida jay maine and bastrop louisiana that were permanently closed in the fourth quarter of 2005 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2007 we expect operating profits to be lower than in the 2006 fourth quarter principally due to lower earnings from real estate sales sales volumes should be seasonally better in the quarter and average price realizations are expected to improve as previously announced paper price increases in europe and brazil and for containerboard in the us are implemented input costs for energy wood and chemicals will be mixed but should average slightly higher in the first quarter the first quarter will benefit from contributions from our recent international papersun coated paperboard joint ventures in china and earnings from the luiz antonio operations in brazil acquired during the quarter

industry segment results 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency and raw material and energy costs 

  

printing papers net sales for 2006 decreased 3 from both 2005 and 2004 due principally to the sale of the us coated papers business in august 2006 however operating profits in 2006 were 43 higher than in 2005 and 33 higher than in 2004 compared with 2005 earnings improved for us uncoated papers market pulp and european papers but this was partially offset by earnings declines in brazilian papers benefits from higher average sales price realizations in the united states europe and brazil 284 million improved manufacturing operations 73 million reduced lackoforder downtime 41 million higher sales volumes in europe 23 million and other items 65 million were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 109 million higher freight costs 45 million and an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the saillat france mill 128 million compared with 2004 higher earnings in 2006 in the us uncoated papers market pulp and coated papers businesses were offset by lower earnings in the european and brazilian papers businesses the printing papers segment took 555000 tons of downtime in 2006 including 150000 tons of lackoforder downtime to align production with customer demand this compared with 970000 tons of total downtime in 2005 of which 520000 tons related to lackoforders 

 

 us uncoated papers net sales in 2006 were 35 billion compared with 32 billion in 2005 and 33 billion in 2004 sales volumes increased in 2006 over 2005 particularly in cutsize paper and printing papers average sales price realizations increased significantly reflecting benefits from price increases announced in late 2005 and early 2006 lackoforder downtime declined from 450000 tons in 2005 to 40000 tons in 2006 reflecting firm market demand and the impact of the permanent closure of three uncoated freesheet machines in 2005 operating earnings in 2006 more than doubled compared with both 2005 and 2004 the benefits of improved average sales price realizations more than offset higher input costs for freight wood and energy which were all above 2005 levels mill operations were favorable compared with 2005 due to currentyear improvements in machine performance lower labor chemical and energy consumption costs as well as approximately 30 million of charges incurred in 2005 for machine shutdowns 

  

us coated papers net sales were 920 million in 2006 16 billion in 2005 and 14 billion in 2004 operating profits in 2006 were 26 lower than in 2005 a small operating loss was reported for the business in 2004 this business was sold in the third quarter of 2006 during the first two quarters of 2006 sales volumes were up slightly versus 2005 average sales price realizations for coated freesheet paper and coated groundwood paper were higher than in 2005 reflecting the impact of previously announced price increases however input costs for energy wood and other raw materials increased over 2005 levels manufacturing operations were favorable due to higher machine efficiency and mill cost savings 

us market pulp sales in 2006 were 509 million compared with 526 million and 437 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels primarily for paper and tissue pulp average sales price realizations were higher in 2006 reflecting higher average prices for fluff pulp and bleached hardwood and softwood pulp operating earnings increased 30 from 2005 and more than 100 from 2004 principally due to the impact of the higher average sales prices input costs for wood and energy were higher in 2006 than in 2005 manufacturing operations were unfavorable driven primarily by poor operations at our riegelwood north carolina mill 

brazilian paper net sales for 2006 of 496 million were higher than the 465 million in 2005 and the 417 million in 2004 the sales increase in 2006 reflects higher sales volumes than in 2005 particularly for uncoated freesheet paper and a strengthening of the brazilian currency versus the us dollar average sales price realizations improved in 2006 primarily for uncoated freesheet paper and wood chips despite higher net sales operating profits for 2006 of 122 million were down from 134 million in 2005 and 166 million in 2004 due principally to incremental costs associated with an extended mill outage in mogi guacu to convert to an elementalchlorinefree bleaching process to rebuild the primary recovery boiler and for other environmental upgrades 

european papers net sales in 2006 were 15 billion compared with 14 billion in 2005 and 15 billion in 2004 sales volumes in 2006 were higher than in 2005 at our eastern european mills due to stronger market demand average sales price realizations increased in 2006 in both eastern and western european markets operating earnings in 2006 rose 20 from 2005 but were 15 below 2004 levels the improvement in 2006 compared with 2005 

  

reflects the contribution from higher net sales partially offset by higher input costs for energy wood and freight 

entering 2007 earnings in the first quarter are expected to improve compared with the 2006 fourth quarter due primarily to reduced manufacturing costs reflecting the completion of the mill optimization project in brazil in the fourth quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally better in the us uncoated paper and market pulp businesses but seasonally weaker in the russian paper business average sales price realizations should improve as we continue to implement previously announced price increases in europe and brazil although us average price realizations are expected to remain flat wood costs are anticipated to be higher due to supply difficulties in the winter months and energy costs will be mixed the firstquarter 2007 acquisition of the luiz antonio mill in brazil will provide incremental earnings during 2007 the pensacola florida mill will be converted to produce containerboard reducing future us production capacity for uncoated freesheet paper 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production in the united states as well as with demand for processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging net sales for 2006 increased 6 compared with 2005 and 8 compared with 2004 operating profits in 2006 were 82 higher than in 2005 and 7 higher than in 2004 benefits from improved price realizations 156 million sales volume increases 29 million a more favorable mix 21 million reduced market related downtime 25 million and strong mill performance 43 million were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs 12 million higher freight costs 48 million higher converting operations costs 21 million and other costs 26 million in addition a gain of 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain the segment took 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 none of which was marketrelated compared with 370000 tons of downtime in 2005 which included 230000 tons of lackoforder downtime 

  

 us containerboard net sales for 2006 were 955 million compared with 895 million in 2005 and 950 million for 2004 average sales price realizations in the first quarter of 2006 began the year below firstquarter 2005 levels but improved significantly during the second quarter and were higher than in 2005 for the remainder of the year sales volumes were higher throughout 2006 operating profits in 2006 were more than double 2005 levels and 68 higher than in 2004 the favorable impacts of the higher average sales price realizations higher sales volumes reduced lackoforder downtime and strong mill performance were only partially offset by higher input costs for freight chemicals and energy 

us converting operations net sales totaled 28 billion in 2006 26 billion in 2005 and 23 billion in 2004 sales volumes throughout the year in 2006 were above 2005 levels reflecting solid market demand for boxes and packaging solutions in the first two quarters of 2006 margins were favorable compared with the prior year as average sales prices outpaced containerboard cost increases but average margins began to decline in the third quarter as containerboard increases outpaced the increase in box prices operating profits in 2006 decreased 72 from 2005 and 86 from 2004 levels primarily due to higher distribution utility and raw material costs and inventory adjustment charges 

european container net sales for 2006 were 10 billion compared with 883 million in 2005 and 865 million in 2004 the increase was principally due to contributions from the moroccan box plants acquired in the fourth quarter of 2005 although sales volumes for the rest of the business were also slightly higher operating profits in 2006 were up 31 compared with 2005 and 6 compared with 2004 this increase included a 13 million gain on the sale of property in spain as well as the increased contributions from the moroccan acquisition partially offset by higher energy costs 

international paper distribution limited our asian box and containerboard business had net sales for 2006 of 182 million in 2005 net sales were 104 million subsequent to international paper’s acquisition of a majority interest in august 2005 this business generated a small operating profit in 2006 compared with a small loss in 2005 

  

earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled firstquarter maintenance outages sales volumes for us converted products will be higher due to more shipping days but expected softer demand should cause the shipments per day to decrease average sales price realizations are expected to be comparable to fourthquarter averages an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter costs for wood energy starch adhesives and freight are expected to increase manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled maintenance outages in the containerboard mills european container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

consumer packaging net sales increased 9 compared with 2005 and 7 compared with 2004 operating profits rose 8 from 2005 but declined 15 from 2004 levels compared with 2005 higher sales volumes 9 million improved average sales price realizations 33 million reduced lackoforder downtime 18 million and favorable mill operations 25 million were partially offset by higher raw material costs 19 million and freight costs 21 million unfavorable mix 14 million and other costs 21 million 

 

 coated paperboard net sales of 15 billion in 2006 were higher than 13 billion in 2005 and 11 billion in 2004 sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 particularly in the folding carton board segment reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products in 2006 our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lackoforder downtime compared with 82000 tons of lackoforder downtime in 2005 average sales price 

realizations were substantially improved in the current year principally for folding carton board and cupstock board operating profits were 51 higher in 2006 than in 2005 and 7 better than in 2004 the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight 

foodservice net sales declined to 396 million in 2006 compared with 437 million in 2005 and 480 million in 2004 due principally to the sale of the jackson tennessee plant in july 2005 sales volumes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 although average sales prices were higher due to the realization of price increases implemented during 2005 operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste 

shorewood net sales of 670 million were down from 691 million in 2005 and 687 million in 2004 sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets although demand was strong in the tobacco segment average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 operating profits were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs 

entering 2007 coated paperboard firstquarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker volume however sales price realizations will be slightly higher and the seasonal switch to hot cup containers will have a favorable impact on product mix shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix 

distribution 

our distribution business principally represented by our xpedx business markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in 

  

many business segments customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions although the commercial printing segment is also dependent on corporate advertising and promotional spending providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor additionally efficient customer service costeffective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability 

 

 distribution 2006 net sales increased 6 from 2005 and 12 from 2004 operating profits in 2006 were 52 higher than in 2005 and 47 higher than in 2004 sales volumes rose for all segments but were particularly strong for packaging and facility supplies average sales prices also increased in all segments the improvement in operating results reflects the higher revenues and improvements in operating expenses resulting from facility realignments and cost reduction actions begun in the second half of 2005 designed to increase the ongoing efficiency of the xpedx distribution system 

looking ahead to the first quarter of 2007 earnings are expected to be comparable to strong 2006 fourth quarter results sales volumes should experience a slight seasonal decline but operating expense improvements should lead to comparable operating profits 

  

forest products 

forest products currently manages approximately 500000 acres of forestlands in the united states forest resources operating results have historically been largely driven by demand and pricing for softwood sawtimber and to a lesser extent for softwood pulpwood by the volume of merchantable timber harvested from company forestlands and by demand and pricing for specific forestland tracts offered for sale with the significant decline in forestlands acreage in 2006 future operations will primarily consist of retail forestland and real estate sales 

 

 forest resources sales in 2006 decreased 23 from 2005 and 13 from 2004 operating profits were down 6 from 2005 but were up 25 from 2004 as part of the company’s announced transformation plan 56 million acres of forestland were sold in 2006 primarily in the fourth quarter resulting in a significant decline in forestland acreage the company intends to focus future operations on maximizing proceeds from the sale of the remaining forestlands 

operating profits from stumpage sales and recreational income were 222 million in 2006 compared with 269 million in 2005 and 281 million in 2004 reflecting the significant reduction in acreage in the fourth quarter operating profits from forestland sales were 447 million in 2006 compared with 400 million in 2005 and 315 million in 2004 operating expenses decreased to 115 million from 146 million in 2005 and 178 million in 2004 reflecting the continuing effects of restructuring efforts and cost reduction initiatives operating profits for the real estate division which principally sells higherandbetteruse properties were 124 million 198 million and 124 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

looking forward to 2007 operating results will be significantly impacted by the forestlands sold in 2006 earnings from harvest and recreation income 

  

will no longer be significant contributors to business operating results while expenses should also decline significantly reflecting the reduced level of operations operating earnings will primarily consist of retail forestland and real estate sales of remaining acreage 

specialty businesses and other 

the specialty businesses and other segment includes the results of the arizona chemical business and certain divested businesses whose results are included in this segment for periods prior to their sale or closure 

this segment’s 2006 net sales increased 2 from 2005 but declined 17 from 2004 operating profits in 2006 were up substantially from both 2005 and 2004 the decline in sales compared with 2004 principally reflects declining contributions from businesses sold or closed 

 

 arizona chemical sales were 769 million in 2006 compared with 692 million in 2005 and 672 million in 2004 sales volumes declined in 2006 compared with 2005 but average sales price realizations in 2006 were higher in both the united states and europe operating earnings in 2006 were significantly higher than in 2005 and more than 49 higher than in 2004 the increase over 2005 reflects the impact of the higher average sales price realizations and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher prices for crude tall oil cto earnings for 2005 also included a 13 million charge related to a plant shutdown in norway 

other businesses in this operating segment include operations that have been sold closed or held for sale primarily the polyrey business in france and in prior years the european distribution business sales for these businesses were approximately 166 million in 2006 compared with 223 million in 2005 and 448 million in 2004 

in december 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the arizona chemical business expected to close in the first quarter of 2007 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy and raw material costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle 

as part of the continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key paper and packaging businesses both globally and in north america spending levels have been kept below the level of depreciation and amortization charges for each of the last three years and we anticipate spending will again be slightly below depreciation and amortization in 2007 

financing activities in 2006 have been focused on the transformation plan objective of strengthening the balance sheet through repayment of debt resulting in a net reduction in 2006 of 52 billion following a 17 billion net reduction in 2005 additionally we made a 10 billion voluntary cash contribution to our us qualified pension plan in december 2006 to begin satisfying projected longterm funding requirements and to lower future pension expense our liquidity position continues to be strong with approximately 30 billion of committed liquidity to cover future shortterm cash flow requirements not met by operating cash flows 

management believes it is important for international paper to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms at december 31 2006 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb stable outlook and baa3 stable outlook from standard  poor’s and moody’s investor services respectively 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 10 billion for 2006 compared with 12 billion for 2005 and 17 billion in 2004 the 2006 amount is net of a 10 billion voluntary cash pension plan contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2006 the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations 

  

adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items and excluding the pension contribution increased by 584 million in 2006 versus 2005 this compared with a decline of 63 million for 2005 over 2004 

international paper’s investments in accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaled 997 million at december 31 2006 cash used for these working capital components increased by 354 million in 2006 compared with a 558 million increase in 2005 and a 117 million increase in 2004 the increase in 2006 was principally due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

investment activities 

investment activities in 2006 included 18 billion of net cash proceeds received from divestitures 16 billion of net cash proceeds received from the sale of us forestlands under the company’s transformation plan and 11 billion of deposits made to prefund project development costs for a pulp mill project in brazil 

capital spending from continuing operations was 10 billion in 2006 or 87 of depreciation and amortization comparable to 992 million or 78 of depreciation and amortization in 2005 and 925 million or 73 of depreciation and amortization in 2004 

the following table presents capital spending from continuing operations by each of our business segments for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 we expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be about 12 billion or about equal to estimated depreciation and amortization we will continue to focus our future capital spending on improving our key platform businesses in north america and on investments in geographic areas with strong growth opportunities

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas nos 132 and 132r “employers’ disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits” sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel additionally as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data reserves for projected future claims settlements relating to exterior siding and roofing products previously manufactured by masonite require judgments regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts international paper utilizes an independent third party consultant to assist in developing these estimates liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future 

remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes the item is deducted in its income tax returns however where treatment of an item is uncertain tax accruals are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter the results of historical negotiated settlements and the results of consultations with outside specialists these accruals are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities changes to the reserves are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the probable outcome such as settlement with relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

  

significant accounting estimates 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2006 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 the table below shows the assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 additionally the health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500550 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash flows are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2007 pension expense by approximately 19 million while a decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 27 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the following chart prepared by international paper illustrates the quarterly performance ranking of our pension fund investments compared with over 300 other corporate and public pension funds the peer group of which international paper is one is the “state street corporate and public master trusts universe” for the last five years international paper’s pension fund performance has averaged in the top 75 of this peer group 

sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of 

  

active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately 11 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from oci into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year are 186 million and 20 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 the increases in 2006 and 2005 us pension expense were principally due to a change in the mortality assumption to use the retirement protection act 2000 tables beginning in 2006 increases in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses over a shorter average remaining service period and reductions in the discount rate 

assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2006 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

 a based on 123106 assumptions 

the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 195 million for its us defined benefit plans in 2007 with the decrease from expense of 377 million in 2006 principally reflecting earnings on the 10 billion of voluntary contributions discussed below lower amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses and an increase in the assumed discount rate to 575 in 2007 from 550 in 2006 the estimated pension 

expense for our nonus plans is 6 million net postretirement benefit costs in 2007 will increase primarily reflecting the acceleration of prior service cost credits into a onetime gain taken in 2006 as a result of multiple divestitures and several plan amendments 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us qualified pension plan at december 31 2006 totaled approximately 84 billion consisting of approximately 57 equity securities 34 fixed income securities and 9 real estate and other assets plan assets included approximately 430000 of international paper common stock 

international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa international paper made voluntary contributions of 10 billion to the qualified defined benefit plan in the fourth quarter of 2006 and does not expect to make any contributions in 2007 the nonqualified plan is only funded to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be 41 million in 2007 

accounting for stock options  international paper adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” to account for stock options in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method under this method expense for stock options is recorded over the related service period based on the grantdate fair market value had sfas no 123r been applied in 2005 and 2004 additional expense of 57 million in 2005 and 38 million in 2004 would have been recorded 

during each reporting period diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

at december 31 2006 360 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share at december 31 2005 416 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share 

  

income taxes 

before minority interest and discontinued operations the company’s effective income tax rates were 59 142 and 30 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special and unusual items that can affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur in those years excluding these special and unusual items the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 29 of pretax earnings compared with 20 in 2005 and 19 in 2004 the increase in the rate in 2006 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2007 effective income tax rate will be 3032 based on expected earnings and business conditions which are subject to change 

recent accounting developments 

the following represent recently issued accounting pronouncements that will affect reporting and disclosures in future periods

fair value measurements in september 2006 the fasb also issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which provides a single definition of fair value together with a framework for measuring it and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific 

measurement and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which it is initially applied the company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement 

accounting for planned major maintenance activities in september 2006 the fasb issued fsp no aug air1 “accounting for planned major maintenance activities” which permits the application of three alternative methods of accounting for planned major maintenance activities the direct expense builtinoverhaul and deferral methods the fsp is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2006 international paper will adopt the direct expense method of accounting for these costs in 2007 with no impact on its annual consolidated financial statements 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and transition and significantly expands income tax disclosure requirements it applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 international paper will apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and currently estimates that the cumulative effect of its initial application on beginning of the year retained earnings will be a charge of approximately 75 million which is subject to revision as management completes its analysis 

accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments – an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” which provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no 133 this statement allows an entity to make an irrevocable 

  

election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety with changes in fair value recognized in earnings this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 international paper believes that the adoption of sfas no 155 in 2007 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

the company’s principal conditional asset retirement obligations relate to the potential future closure or redesign of certain of its production facilities in connection with any such activity it is possible that the company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from the facilities or to remediate in accordance with federal and state laws that govern the handling of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations at this time any such obligations have an 

indeterminate settlement date and the company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expectedpresentvalue technique to estimate any such potential obligations accordingly the company does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation

legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulations as well as similar regulations in all other jurisdictions in which we 

operate our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 161 million was spent in 2006 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 35 million in 2007 for similar capital projects including the costs to comply with the environmental protection agency’s epa cluster rule and industrial boiler mact regulations amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental appropriations during the year 2008 is approximately 27 million and during the year 2009 is approximately 30 million this reduced capital forecast for 2007 2008 and 2009 reflects the reduction in cluster rule spending and completion of significant environmental improvement projects in brazil which accounted for 65 million and 57 million of the 2006 spending respectively 

on april 15 1998 the epa issued final cluster rule regulations that established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges from pulp and paper mills to be met by 2007 the projected costs included in our spending estimate related to the cluster rule regulations for the year 2007 are 6 million the projected costs associated with industrial boiler mact regulations that were issued by the epa on september 30 2006 are 6 million 

the epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future cost requirements to our expenditure forecast 

international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous 

  

substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances and on presently available information international paper believes that its liability is not likely to be significant at 41 such sites and that its liability at 46 sites is likely to be significant but not material to international paper’s consolidated financial statements related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these 87 matters is approximately 40 million 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at international paper’s current or former facilities are recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet and totaled approximately 49 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of february 2007 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

international paper is involved in other contractual disputes administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types while any litigation proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty we believe that the outcome of any proceeding lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

litigation 

we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of our litigation matters as well as ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of the reserves required if any for these contingencies is based largely on those assessments ultimately however the determination of any reserve balance is based on good faith estimates and judgments which given the unpredictable nature of litigation could prove to be inaccurate as a result the reserve amounts in any given matter may change at any time in the future due to new unexpected developments analysis of our significant litigation activity is discussed below and 

further details of these and other litigation matters are discussed in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

antitrust matters 

in recent years several antitrust class action lawsuits were filed against companies in our industry the company was named as a defendant in some of those lawsuits but has reached favorable settlements after protracted litigation 

current management has a strong commitment to antitrust compliance this is evidenced by the company’s adoption of a code of business ethics which applies to employees and executives alike and robust systems to ensure compliance with antitrust laws regulations and our own policies we place a very high priority on training our employees on current antitrust laws around the world and proper conduct under those laws in this effort we employ both live and online training programs and distribute the company’s antitrust compliance manual in addition the company has a tollfree hotline which enables employees to make anonymous reports about suspected violation of law or company policy this reporting system is also available to the general public with access information publicized on our internet site we believe that these efforts together with strong leadership about the importance of compliance will minimize the company’s exposure in this area 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitive 

  

ness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investmentgrade securities of financial institutions and industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2006 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was immaterial 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s optimal capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement the optimal capital structure at december 31 2006 and 2005 the 

net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 38 billion and 86 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 133 million and 326 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices at december 31 2006 the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts was approximately a 12 million liability at december 31 2005 the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts was immaterial the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately 10 million for december 31 2006 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis through financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2006 and 2005 the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a 95 million asset and a 211 million liability respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 43 million and 20 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition these controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

   

  

 all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to such financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding the system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2006 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on pages 45 and 46 management concluded that based on its assessment the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2006 

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report included herein 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and 

  

control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of five independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this annual report on form 10k and in particular statements found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical in nature may constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are often identified by the words “will” “may” “should” “continue” “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “appear” “project” “estimate” “intend” and words of a similar nature such statements reflect the current views of international paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements below we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

risks relating to industry conditions 

changes in the cost or availability of raw material and energy  we rely heavily on certain raw materials principally wood fiber caustic soda and polyethylene and energy sources principally natural gas coal and fuel oil in our manufacturing process our ability to increase earnings has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources we may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

changes in transportation costs our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products both domestically and internationally in the united states an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges andor a reduction in transport availability in truck and rail could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner while we have benefited from supply chain initiatives that provide adequate transportation availability there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 

  

competition  we face intense competition both domestically and internationally for our products in all of our current operating segments including the two key platform businesses under our previously announced transformation plan uncoated papers and packaging because our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share due to pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulty a failure to price our products competitively competition from producers of substitute materials or other similar factors could negatively impact our revenues and financial results 

product mix our results may be affected by a change in the company’s sales mix our outlook assumes a certain volume mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales our operations for example by way of lackoforder downtime and our results could be negatively impacted 

pricing  our outlook assumes that we will be successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as other price increases that we may in the future deem necessary andor appropriate also delays in acceptance of these price increases would negatively impact our results moreover price discounting if required to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realizations 

demand for our products  demand for our products is affected by general economic conditions in north america europe south america and asia changes in industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels new home construction and repair and remodeling activity interest rates and currency exchange rates may adversely affect our businesses and the results of operations 

risks relating to market and economic factors 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy our debt ratings are from time to time reviewed by the rating organizations and remain subject to change for example in 2005 moody’s downgraded our debt from baa2 to baa3 

pension and health care costs  our pension and health care benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in 

increased or decreased pension costs in future periods likewise changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease pension costs future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation currently being considered in the us congress 

natural disasters  the occurrence of a natural disaster such as a hurricane tropical storm earthquake tornado flooding or other unanticipated problems could cause operational disruptions which could impair our profitability 

changes in international conditions  our results could be substantially affected by foreign market risks in the countries in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil russia poland china and south korea where substantial manufacturing facilities exist are developing countries subject to economic and political instability downturns in economic activity adverse foreign tax consequences or any change in social political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results 

changes in currency exchange rates  we are impacted by the movement of various currencies relative to the us dollar from time to time we may hedge a portion of the risk from our transactions and commitments denominated in nonus dollar currencies when we deem it appropriate to do so there can however be no assurance that we will be able to fully protect ourselves against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

risks relating to the company’s transformation plan 

ability to accomplish the transformation plan on july 19 2005 the company announced a threepart plan the “transformation plan” to transform its business portfolio to improve returns strengthen the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders the transformation plan includes narrowing the company’s business portfolio to two key global platform businesses uncoated papers including the xpedx distribution business and packaging among the uncertainties that exist to completing the transformation plan are uncertainties relating to the company’s ability to divest or spinoff the businesses under evaluation as well as the timing terms and net proceeds of any such transactions 

impact of the transformation plan on the company’s relationships with its employees  the company has taken steps to incent and retain employees during the transformation and has entered into retention agreements with certain key employees who would not remain with the company if their respective businesses are sold 

  

ability to realize anticipated profit improvement from the transformation plan the profitability of the company’s two platform businesses uncoated papers and packaging is subject to variable demand and the company’s ability to execute internal profit initiatives including ongoing supply chain and overhead initiatives and volumemix improvements there can be no assurance that profit improvements will be achieved 

risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs 

unanticipated expenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations  our operations are subject to significant regulation by federal state and local environmental and safety authorities both domestically and internationally there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing and new regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or that existing reserves will be adequate to cover future unanticipated costs 

results of legal proceedings  the costs and other effects of pending litigation against the company and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty although the disclosure in item 3 “legal proceedings” contains management’s current views of the impact such litigation will have on our financial results there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected 

this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook obvious general economic factors throughout the world such as inflation a sudden drop in consumer or business confidence or an unexpected collapse in stock markets do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause our actual results to differ from those currently anticipated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

international paper’s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for energy wood caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by 586 million lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lackoforder downtime in our us uncoated paper and containerboard mills and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in poland and russia to add needed uncoated paper and paperboard capacity we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations improved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades a more favorable product mix and higher earnings from forestland and real estate sales 

looking forward to 2006 we expect operating profits for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are implemented while energy wood and raw material price movements are mixed their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat 

however we see favorable signs of positive momentum for the remainder of 2006 we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger and that we will realize 2005 fourthquarter and 2006 firstquarter announced price increases additionally operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and containerboard we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that if the trend continues should benefit operations as the year progresses 

in connection with our overall strategic direction we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spinoff of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 we also will continue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill operations to reduce costs improve our products and improve our overall profitability 

results of operations 

industry segment operating profits are used by international paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes 

that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest interest expense corporate items and corporate special items industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

international paper operates in six segments printing papers industrial packaging consumer packaging distribution forest products and specialty businesses and other 

the following table shows the components of net earnings loss for each of the last three years 

 

 

  special items include restructuring and other charges net losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required 

industry segment operating profits were 117 million lower in 2005 due principally to the impact of higher energy and raw material costs 586 million lower sales volume 251 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation rates 27 million which more than offset the benefits from higher average prices 478 million cost reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix 235 million and higher earnings from land sales 158 million the impact of divestitures 32 million principally the fine papers and industrial papers businesses and other items 36 million also had a negative impact in 2005 

segment operating profit 

in millions 

  

the principal changes in operating profit by segment were as follows printing papers ’ profits were 29 million lower as the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation rates more than offset the effects of higher average sales prices improved sales mix and lower operating and overhead costs industrial packaging ’s profits were down by 150 million reflecting higher energy and raw material costs lower sales volume an unfavorable mix of products sold and the impact of the sale of the industrial papers business these effects were somewhat offset by benefits from higher sales prices consumer packaging ’s profits were 35 million lower as the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs and lower sales volume more than offset contributions from higher sales prices and lower operating and overhead costs forest products ’ profits were 134 million higher increased earnings from land sales an improved product mix and lower overhead costs more than offset the effect of higher energy and raw material costs lower harvest volumes and special items distribution ’s profits were 3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004 

corporate items of 597 million of expense in 2005 were higher than the 469 million in 2004 and 466 million in 2003 due to higher pension and supply chain initiative costs and increased inventoryrelated costs partially offset by lower overhead costs 

corporate special items including restructuring and other charges losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required increased to 147 million from 142 million in 2004 but were lower than the 281 million in 2003 the increase in 2005 versus 2004 reflects an increase in restructuring charges relating principally to our transformation plan offset by higher insurance recoveries relating to hardboard siding and roofing matters compared with 2003 the decrease reflects higher insurance recoveries and lower losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in 2005 

interest expense net of 593 million in 2005 includes a pretax credit of 43 million related to an agreement reached with the internal revenue service concerning the company’s 1997 through 2000 federal income tax audits and a pretax credit of 11 million related to the collection of a note receivable from the 2001 sale of the flexible packaging business excluding these items interest expense net of 647 million decreased from 710 million in 2004 and 705 million in 2003 reflecting lower average debt balances from debt refinancing and repayments in 2004 and 2005 

the 2005 income tax benefit of 285 million includes a 446 million tax benefit related to 2005 tax special items the 242 million tax provision in 2004 included a 32 million tax provision related to tax 

special items the tax benefit of 56 million in 2003 included 110 million of benefits related to special items occurring in 2003 see “income taxes” on pages 14 and 15 for a further discussion of these items 

during the 2005 third quarter international paper completed the sale of the carter holt harvey limited business during 2004 international paper completed the sale of its weldwood of canada limited business in the fourth quarter the operating results of these businesses and the gains or losses on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 

accounting changes included a charge of 13 million in 2003 for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements regarding asset retirement obligations and variable interest entities 

liquidity and capital resources 

for the year ended december 31 2005 international paper generated 15 billion of cash flow from continuing operations down from 21 billion in 2004 capital spending from continuing operations for the year totaled 12 billion or 84 of depreciation and amortization expense we repaid approximately 17 billion of debt during the year including various higher coupon rate debt that will result in lower interest charges in future years our liquidity position remains strong supported by approximately 32 billion of unused committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future shortterm liquidity requirements maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our longterm debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy 

our focus in 2006 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while further reducing our longterm debt as our previously announced transformation plan progresses capital spending for 2006 is targeted at 12 billion or about 80 of depreciation and amortization 

transformation plan 

in july 2005 international paper announced a transformation plan to focus on two key global platform businesses uncoated papers including distribution and packaging in connection with this plan the company is exploring strategic alternatives for other businesses including coated and supercalendered papers beverage packaging kraft papers arizona chemical wood products and segments or potentially all of its 65 million acres of us forestlands this evaluation process is underway with decisions anticipated for some of these businesses in 2006 while the exact use of any proceeds from potential future sales is dependent upon various factors the company remains committed to using its free cash flow in 2006 to pay down debt to return value to shareholders and for selective highreturn investments 

  

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position and that can require judgments by management in their application include accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and goodwill pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes 

in recent years the assumption estimates used for pensions have resulted in increases in reported pension charges pension expenses for our us plans increased to 243 million in 2005 from 111 million in 2004 due principally to an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a reduction in the assumed discount rate a further increase of approximately 130 million is expected in 2006 reflecting a change in the mortality assumption to use a more recent mortality table an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a further reduction in the assumed discount rate our pension funding policy continues to be to fully fund actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa unless changes are made to our funding policy it is unlikely that any contributions to our us qualified plan will be required in 2006 funding requirements in later years will depend upon current pending legislation investment performance and changes in discount rates 

legal 

payments relating to the hardboard exterior siding class action settlement exceeded our projections for the year but payments related to the other two class actions continue to be in line with projections made in 2002 the company settled with all of its insurance carriers except one related to the hardboard siding claims and settled all but one of the small optout cases in the linerboard antitrust litigation additional information on these and other matters is included in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

corporate overview 

while the operating results for international paper’s various business segments are driven by a number of businessspecific factors changes in international paper’s operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in the united states europe south america and asia factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial nondurable goods production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity whitecollar employment levels new home construction and repair and remodeling activity and movements in currency exchange rates 

product prices also tend to follow general economic trends and are also affected by inventory levels currency movements and changes in worldwide operating rates in addition to these revenuerelated factors net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs principally wood fiber and chemical costs energy costs salary and benefits costs including pensions and manufacturing conversion costs 

the following is a discussion of international paper’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2004 and 2003

corporate items and interest expense 

minority interest expense net of taxes decreased to 12 million in 2005 compared with 26 million in 2004 and 83 million in 2003 the decreases in 2005 and 2004 reflect a reduction in minority interest related to preferred securities that were replaced by debt obligations in 2004 and 2003

our supply chain initiative begun in late 2002 is a corporatewide project to improve customer service capabilities and implement “best practice” supply chain business processes for order management supply and demand planning product scheduling and tracking transportation and warehousing and procurement expenses related to this program in 2006 should be approximately 50 million above 2005 levels the associated benefits are reflected in business earnings as the programs are implemented

looking forward to the first quarter of 2006 we expect operating profits to be about flat with the 2005 fourth quarter sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are implemented while energy wood and raw material price movements are mixed their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat

industry segment results 

printing papers 

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for uncoated cutsize products with changes in whitecollar employment levels that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers in different geographic regions principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency and raw material and energy costs 

printing papers net sales for 2005 increased 2 from 2004 and 8 from 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 5 lower than in 2004 but 19 higher than in 2003 compared with 2004 us coated paper and market pulp earnings improved but this was offset by earnings declines in us uncoated papers european papers and brazilian papers benefits from improved mill operations and lower overhead costs 129 million and higher average sales prices in the united states 371 million 

  

were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs 312 million increased market related downtime 187 million and other items 30 million compared with 2003 higher 2005 earnings in the brazilian papers us coated papers and us market pulp businesses were offset by lower earnings in the us uncoated papers and the european papers businesses the printing papers segment took 995000 tons of downtime in 2005 including 540000 tons of lackoforder downtime to align production with customer demand this compared with 525000 tons of downtime in 2004 of which 65000 tons related to lackoforders 

 

 uncoated papers sales totaled 48 billion in 2005 compared with 50 billion in 2004 and 2003 sales price realizations in the united states averaged 44 higher in 2005 than in 2004 and 46 higher than 2003 favorable pricing momentum which began in 2004 carried over into the beginning of 2005 demand however began to weaken across all grades as the year progressed resulting in lower price realizations in the second and third quarters however prices stabilized as the year ended total shipments for the year were 72 lower than in 2004 and 42 lower than in 2003 to continue matching our productive capacity with customer demand the business announced the permanent closure of three uncoated freesheet machines and took significant lackoforder downtime during the period demand showed some improvement toward the end of the year bolstered by the introduction our new line of vision innovation paper products vip technologies tm  with improved brightness and whiteness mill operations were favorable compared to last year and the rebuild of the no 1 machine at the eastover south carolina mill was completed as planned in the fourth quarter however the favorable impacts of improved mill operations and lower overhead costs were more than offset by record high input costs for energy and wood and higher transportation costs compared to 2004 the earnings decline in 2005 compared with 2003 was principally due to lower shipments higher downtime and increased costs for wood energy and transportation partially offset by lower overhead costs and favorable mill operations 

average sales price realizations for our european operations remained relatively stable during 2005 but averaged 1 lower than in 2004 and 6 below 2003 levels sales volumes rose slightly up 1 in 2005 compared with 2004 and 5 compared to 2003 earnings were lower than in 2004 reflecting higher wood and 

energy costs and a compression of margins due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange movements earnings were also adversely affected by downtime related to the rebuild of three paper machines during the year 

coated papers sales in the united states were 16 billion in 2005 compared with 14 billion in 2004 and 13 billion in 2003 the business reported an operating profit in 2005 versus a small operating loss in 2004 the earnings improvement was driven by higher average sales prices and improved mill operations price realizations in 2005 averaged 13 higher than 2004 higher input costs for raw materials and energy partially offset the benefits from improved prices and operations sales volumes were about 1 lower in 2005 versus 2004 

market pulp sales from our us and european facilities totaled 757 million in 2005 compared with 661 million and 571 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively operating profits in 2005 were up 86 from 2004 an operating loss had been reported in 2003 higher average prices and sales volumes lower overhead costs and improved mill operations in 2005 more than offset increases in raw material energy and chemical costs us softwood and hardwood pulp prices improved through the 2005 first and second quarters then declined during the third quarter but recovered somewhat toward year end softwood pulp prices ended the year about 2 lower than 2004 but were 15 higher than 2003 while hardwood pulp prices ended the year about 15 higher than 2004 and 10 higher than 2003 us pulp sales volumes were 12 higher than in 2004 and 19 higher than in 2003 reflecting increased global demand european pulp volumes increased 15 and 2 compared with 2004 and 2003 respectively while average sales prices increased 4 and 11 compared with 2004 and 2003 respectively 

brazilian paper sales were 684 million in 2005 compared with 592 million in 2004 and 540 million in 2003 sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper coated paper and wood chips were down from 2004 but average price realizations improved for exported uncoated freesheet and coated groundwood paper grades favorable currency translation as yearly average real exchange rates versus the us dollar were 17 higher in 2005 than in 2004 positively impacted reported sales in us dollars average sales prices for domestic uncoated paper declined 4 in local currency versus 2004 while domestic coated paper prices were down 3 operating profits in 2005 were down 9 from 2004 but were up 2 from 2003 earnings in 2005 were negatively impacted by a weaker product and geographic sales mix for both uncoated and coated papers reflecting increased competition and softer demand particularly in the printing commercial and editorial market segments 

  

entering 2006 earnings in the first quarter are expected to improve compared with the 2005 fourth quarter due principally to higher average price realizations reflecting announced price increases product demand for the first quarter should be seasonally slow but is expected to strengthen as the year progresses supported by continued economic growth in north america asia and eastern europe average prices should also improve in 2006 as price increases announced in late 2005 and early 2006 for uncoated freesheet paper and pulp continue to be realized operating rates are expected to improve as a result of industrywide capacity reductions in 2005 although energy and raw material costs remain high there has been some decline in both natural gas and delivered wood costs with further moderation expected later in 2006 we will continue to focus on further improvements in our global manufacturing operations implementation of supply chain enhancements and reductions in overhead costs during 2006 

industrial packaging 

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable industrial goods production in the united states as well as with demand for processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

industrial packaging’s net sales for 2005 increased 2 compared with 2004 and were 18 higher than in 2003 reflecting the inclusion of international paper distribution limited formerly international paper pacific millennium limited beginning in august 2005 operating profits in 2005 were 39 lower than in 2004 and 13 lower than in 2003 sales volume increases 24 million improved price realizations 66 million and strong mill operating performance 27 million were not enough to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 103 million higher market related downtime costs 50 million higher converting operating costs 22 million and unfavorable mix and other costs 67 million additionally the may 2005 sale of our industrial papers business resulted in a 25 million lower earnings contribution from this business in 2005 the segment took 370000 tons of downtime in 2005 including 230000 tons of lackoforder downtime to balance internal supply with customer demand compared to a total of 170000 tons in 2004 which included 5000 tons of lackoforder downtime 

 

   

containerboard’s net sales totaled 895 million in 2005 951 million in 2004 and 815 million in 2003 soft market conditions and declining customer demand at the end of the first quarter led to lower average sales prices during the second and third quarters beginning in the fourth quarter prices recovered as a result of increased customer demand and a rationalization of supply full year sales volumes trailed 2004 levels early in the year reflecting the weak market conditions in the first half of 2005 however volumes rebounded in the second half of the year and finished the year ahead of 2004 levels operating profits decreased 38 from 2004 but were flat with 2003 the favorable impacts of increased sales volumes higher average sales prices and improved mill operating performance were not enough to offset the impact of higher wood energy and other raw material costs and increased lackoforder downtime implementation of the new supply chain operating model in our containerboard mills during 2005 resulted in increased operating efficiency and cost savings 

specialty papers in 2005 included the kraft paper business for the full year and the industrial papers business for five months prior to its sale in may 2005 net sales totaled 468 million in 2005 723 million in 2004 and 690 million in 2003 operating profits in 2005 were down 23 compared with 2004 and 54 compared with 2003 reflecting the lower contribution from industrial papers 

us converting operations net sales for 2005 were 26 billion compared with 23 billion in 2004 and 19 billion in 2003 sales volumes were up 10 in 2005 compared with 2004 mainly due to the acquisition of box usa in july 2004 average sales prices in 2005 began the year above 2004 levels but softened in the second half of the year operating profits in 2005 decreased 46 and 4 from 2004 and 2003 levels respectively primarily due to increased linerboard freight and energy costs 

european container sales for 2005 were 883 million compared with 865 million in 2004 and 801 million in 2003 operating profits declined 19 and 13 compared with 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in sales in 2005 reflected a slight increase in demand over 2004 but this was not sufficient to offset the negative earnings effect of increased operating costs unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a reduction in average sales prices the moroccan box plant acquisition which was completed in october 2005 favorably impacted fourthquarter results 

industrial packaging’s sales in 2005 included 104 million from international paper distribution limited our asian box and containerboard business subsequent to the acquisition of an additional 50 interest in august 2005 

  

entering 2006 industrial packaging earnings are expected to improve significantly in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter 2005 average price realizations should continue to benefit from price increases announced in late 2005 and early 2006 for linerboard and domestic boxes containerboard sales volumes are expected to drop slightly in the 2006 first quarter due to fewer shipping days but growth is anticipated for us converted products due to stronger demand costs for wood freight and energy are expected to remain stable during the 2006 first quarter approaching fourth quarter 2005 levels the continued implementation of the new supply chain model at our mills during 2006 will bring additional efficiency improvements and cost savings on a global basis the european container operating results are expected to improve as a result of targeted market growth and cost reduction initiatives and we will begin seeing further contributions from our recent moroccan box plant acquisition and from international paper distribution limited 

consumer packaging 

demand and pricing for consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix 

consumer packaging’s 2005 net sales of 26 billion were flat compared with 2004 and 5 higher compared with 2003 operating profits in 2005 declined 22 from 2004 and 31 from 2003 as improved price realizations 46 million and favorable operations in the mills and converting operations 60 million could not overcome the impact of cost increases in energy wood polyethylene and other raw materials 120 million lackoforder downtime 13 million and other costs 8 million 

 

 bleached board net sales of 864 million in 2005 were up from 842 million in 2004 and 751 million in 2003 the effects in 2005 of improved average price realizations and mill operating improvements were not enough to offset increased energy wood polyethylene and other raw material costs a slight decrease in volume and increased lackoforder downtime bleached board mills took 100000 tons of downtime in 2005 including 65000 tons of lackoforder downtime compared with 40000 tons of downtime in 2004 none of which 

was market related during 2005 restructuring and manufacturing improvement plans were implemented to reduce costs and improve market alignment 

foodservice net sales were 437 million in 2005 compared with 480 million in 2004 and 460 million in 2003 average sales prices in 2005 were up 3 however domestic cup and lid sales volumes were 5 lower than in 2004 as a result of a rationalization of our customer base early in 2005 operating profits in 2005 increased 147 compared with 2004 largely due to the settlement of a lawsuit and a favorable adjustment on the sale of the jackson tennessee bag plant excluding unusual items operating profits were flat as improved price realizations offset increased costs for bleached board and resin 

shorewood net sales of 691 million in 2005 were essentially flat with net sales in 2004 of 687 million but were up compared with 665 million in 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 17 above 2004 levels and about equal to 2003 levels improved margins resulting from a rationalization of the customer mix and the effects of improved manufacturing operations including the successful start up of our south korean tobacco operations more than offset cost increases for board and paper and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in canada 

beverage packaging net sales were 597 million in 2005 595 million in 2004 and 589 million in 2003 average sale price realizations increased 2 compared with 2004 principally the result of the passthrough of higher raw material costs although the implementation of price increases continues to be impacted by competitive pressures operating profits were down 14 compared with 2004 and 19 compared with 2003 due principally to increases in board and resin costs 

in 2006 the bleached board market is expected to remain strong with sales volumes increasing in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 for both folding carton and cup products improved price realizations are also expected for bleached board and in our foodservice and beverage packaging businesses although continued high costs for energy wood and resin will continue to negatively impact earnings shorewood should continue to benefit from strong asian operations and from targeted sales volume growth in 2006 capital improvements and operational excellence initiatives undertaken in 2005 should benefit operating results in 2006 for all businesses 

distribution 

our distribution business principally represented by our xpedx business markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in many business segments customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions although the 

  

commercial printing segment is also dependent on corporate advertising and promotional spending distribution earnings and cash flows are generally stable providing customers with the best choice and value in both products and supply chain services is a key competitive factor additionally efficient customer service costeffective logistics and focused working capital management are key factors in this segment’s profitability 

 

 distribution’s 2005 net sales increased 5 from 2004 and 9 from 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 3 lower than 2004 but were 5 higher than 2003 sales rose in part as a result of higher average sales prices for paper tissue and packaging products sales volumes for packaging and facility supplies increased due to xpedx’s increasing success in positioning itself as a national service provider to other distributors manufacturers and retailers while revenues increased in 2005 operating profits decreased reflecting increased expenses associated with initiatives targeting further penetration of fastergrowing market segments and costs of facility realignments to improve the ongoing efficiency of the xpedx distribution system 

the outlook for distribution for 2006 is favorable average sales prices and margins are expected to remain at or above 2005 levels and additional market penetration is targeted in the printing manufacturing redistribution and retail segments additional benefits are also expected from prioryear programs to further reduce operating costs 

forest products 

forest products manages approximately 65 million acres of forestlands in the united states and operates wood products plants in the united states that produce lumber plywood engineered wood products and utility poles forest resources operating results are largely driven by demand and pricing for softwood sawtimber and to a lesser extent for softwood pulpwood by the volume of merchantable timber available to be harvested from company forestlands and by demand and pricing for specific forestland tracts offered for sale wood products operating results are driven by new housing starts and repair and remodeling activity fiber costs are a major factor in wood products profitability 

forest products net sales for 2005 were up 7 compared with both 2004 and 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 17 and 29 higher than in 2004 and 2003 respectively earnings in 2005 compared with 2004 reflected higher earnings from forestland and real estate 

sales 159 million and decreased forestland operating expenses 32 million partially offset by reduced harvest and recreational income 12 million and lower wood products earnings 45 million due principally to higher raw material costs 

 

 forest resources sales in 2005 were 10 billion compared with 900 million in 2004 and 11 billion in 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 33 higher than in 2004 and 12 higher than in 2003 primarily due to higher forestland sales 

operating profits from stumpage sales and recreational income were 269 million in 2005 compared with 281 million in 2004 and 268 million in 2003 harvest volumes declined 13 in 2005 compared with 2004 and 20 from 2003 reflecting a lower inventory of mature sawtimber in 2005 sawtimber prices were up 9 compared to both 2003 and 2004 operating profits from forestland sales were 400 million in 2005 compared with 315 million in 2004 and 462 million in 2003 reflecting fewer acres sold but higher sales prices per acre operating expenses decreased to 146 million in 2005 from 178 million in 2004 and 157 million in 2003 reflecting the effects of restructuring efforts and cost reduction initiatives operating profits for the real estate division which principally sells higherandbetter use properties were 198 million 124 million and 71 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively international paper monetizes its forest assets in various ways including sales of short and longterm harvest rights on a payascut or lumpsum bulksale basis as well as through the sales of timberlands 

for 2006 our harvest is projected to decline 14 due to a lower inventory of mature timber however in future years the harvest profile is expected to improve as timber tracts mature and the benefits of higher yieldperacre initiatives are realized average firstquarter 2006 southern pine pulpwood pine sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood prices are expected to remain close to fourthquarter 2005 levels forestland sales will continue to be dependent upon various factors including tract location and the level of investor interest 

  

wood products sales in the united states in 2005 of 16 billion were up 3 from 15 billion in 2004 and 18 from 13 billion in 2003 average price realizations for lumber were up 6 and 21 in 2005 compared with 2004 and 2003 respectively lumber sales volumes in 2005 were up 5 versus 2004 and 10 versus 2003 average sales prices for plywood were down 4 from 2004 but were 15 higher than in 2003 plywood sales volumes in 2005 were slightly higher than 2004 and 2003 operating profits in 2005 were 18 lower than 2004 but nearly three times higher than 2003 lower average plywood prices and higher raw material costs more than offset the effects of higher average lumber prices volume increases and a positive sales mix in 2005 log costs were up 9 versus 2004 negatively impacting both plywood and lumber profits lumber and plywood operating costs also reflected substantially higher glue and natural gas costs versus both 2004 and 2003 

looking forward to the first quarter of 2006 a continued strong housing market combined with low product inventory in the distribution chain should translate into continued strong lumber and plywood demand however a possible softening of housing starts and higher interest rates later in the year could put downward pressure on pricing in the second half of 2006 

specialty businesses and other 

the specialty businesses and other segment includes the operating results of arizona chemical european distribution and prior to its closure in 2003 our natchez mississippi chemical cellulose pulp mill also included are certain divested businesses whose results are included in this segment for periods prior to their sale or closure 

this segment’s 2005 net sales declined 18 and 26 from 2004 and 2003 respectively operating profits in 2005 were down substantially from both 2004 and 2003 the decline in sales principally reflects declining contributions from businesses sold or closed operating profits were also affected by higher energy and raw material costs in our chemical business 

 

 chemicals sales were 692 million in 2005 compared with 672 million in 2004 and 625 million in 2003 although demand was strong for most arizona chemical product lines operating profits in 2005 were 84 and 83 lower than in 2004 and 2003 respectively due to higher energy costs in the us and higher prices and reduced availability for crude tall oil 

cto in the united states energy costs increased 41 compared to 2004 due to higher natural gas prices and supply interruption costs cto prices increased 26 compared to 2004 as certain energy users turned to cto as a substitute fuel for highcost alternative energy sources such as natural gas and fuel oil european cto receipts decreased 30 compared to 2004 due to lower yields following the finnish paper industry strike and a swedish storm that limited cto throughput and corresponding sales volumes 

other businesses in this operating segment include operations that have been sold closed or are held for sale principally the european distribution business the oil and gas and mineral royalty business decorative products retail packaging and the natchez chemical cellulose pulp mill sales for these businesses were approximately 223 million in 2005 mainly european distribution and decorative products compared with 448 million in 2004 mainly european distribution and decorative products and 610 million in 2003 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

a major factor in international paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key cash operating costs such as energy and raw material costs do have an effect on operating cash generation we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle as a result we believe that we are well positioned for improvements in operating cash flow should prices and worldwide economic conditions improve in the future 

as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment we have focused our capital spending on improving our key platform businesses in north america and in geographic areas with strong growth opportunities spending levels have been kept below the level of depreciation and amortization charges for each of the last three years and we anticipate continuing this approach in 2006 

with the low interest rate environment in 2005 financing activities have focused largely on the repayment or refinancing of higher coupon debt resulting in a net reduction in debt of approximately 17 billion in 2005 we plan to continue this program with additional reductions anticipated as our previously announced transformation plan progresses in 2006 our liquidity position continues to be strong with approximately 32 billion of committed liquidity to cover future shortterm cash flow requirements not met by operating cash flows 

  

management believes it is important for international paper to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms at december 31 2005 the company held longterm credit ratings of bbb negative outlook and baa3 stable outlook from standard  poor’s and moody’s investor services respectively 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by continuing operations totaled 15 billion for 2005 compared with 21 billion in 2004 and 15 billion in 2003 the major components of cash provided by continuing operations are earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items declined by 83 million in 2005 versus 2004 this compared with an increase of 612 million for 2004 over 2003 

working capital representing international paper’s investments in accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities was 26 billion at december 31 2005 cash used for working capital components increased by 591 million in 2005 compared with a 86 million increase in 2004 and an 11 million increase in 2003 the increase in 2005 was principally due to a decline in accrued liabilities at december 31 2005 

investment activities 

capital spending from continuing operations was 12 billion in 2005 or 84 of depreciation and amortization comparable to the 12 billion or 87 of depreciation and amortization in 2004 and 10 billion or 74 of depreciation and amortization in 2003 

the following table presents capital spending from continuing operations by each of our business segments for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 we expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be about 12 billion or about 80 of depreciation and amortization we will continue to focus our future capital spending on improving our key platform businesses in 

north america and on investments in geographic areas with strong growth opportunities

international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2006 through cash from operations and divestiture proceeds supplemented as required by its various existing credit facilities international paper has approximately 32 billion of committed liquidity which we believe is adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during our industry’s economic cycles this includes a 750 million fully committed bank credit agreement that expires in march 2006 a 125 billion fully committed bank credit agreement that expires in march 2009 and up to 12 billion of available commercial paperbased financings under a receivables securitization program that expires november 2007 at

the company was well within the requirements for compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 2005 principal financial covenants include maintenance of a minimum net worth of 9 billion defined as the sum of common stock paidin capital and retained earnings less treasury stock plus any goodwill impairment charges and a maximum total debt to capital ratio defined as total debt divided by total debt plus net worth of 60

 transformation plan

      consistent with this evaluation process the company has distributed bid package information for some of these businesses the exact timing of this evaluation process will vary by business however it is anticipated that decisions will be made for some of these businesses during 2006 while the exact use of any proceeds from potential future sales is dependent upon various factors affecting future cash flows such as the amount of any proceeds received and changes in market conditions input costs and capital spending the company remains committed to using its free cash flow in 2006 to pay down debt to return value to shareholders and for selective highreturn investments 

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper and that can require judgments by management that affect their application include sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas nos 132 and 132r “employers’ disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting policies on international paper 

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel additionally as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data reserves for projected future claims settlements relating to exterior siding and roofing products previously manufactured by masonite require judgments regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts international paper utilizes an independent third party consultant to assist in developing these estimates liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill  an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset 

  

may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets 

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper’s consulting actuary and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 

income taxes  international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates where the company believes that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes the item is deducted in its income tax returns however where treatment of an item is uncertain tax accruals are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter the results of historical negotiated settlements and the results of consultations with outside specialists these accruals are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities changes to the reserves are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the probable outcome such as settlement with relevant tax authority the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year change in tax laws or a recent court case that addresses the matter 

while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts 

significant accounting estimates 

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2005 for international paper’s pension and postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 the table below shows the assumptions used by international paper to calculate us pension expenses for the years shown 

 

 

 additionally the health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of us postretirement obligations for the years shown were 

 

 international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately 500550 aagraded bonds the plan’s projected cash flows are then matched to this yield curve to develop the discount rate 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects projected returns for an investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study that meets the plans’ investment objectives increasing decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would decrease increase 2006 pension expense by approximately 16 million while a decrease increase of 25 in the discount rate would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 27 million the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be approximately 2 million 

  

actual rates of return earned on us pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were 

 

 the following chart prepared by international paper illustrates the quarterly performance ranking of our pension fund investments compared with approximately 100 other corporate and public pension funds the peer group of which international paper is one is the “state street corporate and public master trusts universe”

sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately 11 years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years at december 31 2005 unrecognized net actuarial losses for international paper’s us pension plans totaled approximately 32 billion while actual future amortization charges will be affected by future gainslosses the amortization of cumulative unrecognized losses as of december 31 2005 is expected to increase us pension expense by approximately 68 million in 2006 while decreasing expense by 24 million and 38 million in 2007 and 2008 respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses calculated for all of international paper’s plans were as follows 

 

 assuming that discount rates expected longterm returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as in 2005 projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows 

 

  

 the increases in 2005 and 2004 us pension expense were due to increases in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses reductions in the discount rate a reduction in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and a reduction in 2004 in the assumed rate of future compensation increase 

for 2006 the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 370 million for its us defined benefit plans with the increase from expense of 243 million in 2005 principally reflecting a change in the mortality assumption to use the retirement protection act 2000 table rp2000 in 2006 versus the group annuity mortality table 1983 gam 83 used in 2005 amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses over a shorter average remaining service period and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 550 in 2006 from 575 in 2005 the estimated 2006 pension expense for our nonus plans is 17 million net postretirement benefit costs in 2006 will remain at current levels 

the market value of plan assets for international paper’s us pension plan at december 31 2005 totaled approximately 69 billion consisting of approximately 61 equity securities 28 fixed income securities and 11 real estate and other assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock 

  

international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa while international paper may elect to make voluntary contributions to its us qualified plan up to the maximum deductible amount per irs tax regulations in the coming years it is unlikely that any contributions to the plan will be required in 2006 unless investment performance is negative or international paper changes its funding policy to make contributions above the minimum requirements the us congress is currently considering various proposals that would change the minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit plans in future years while the amount of any required contributions after 2006 will depend upon the final rules adopted and other factors including changes in discount rates and actual plan asset returns the company currently estimates that a contribution in 2007 of 40 million to 200 million may be required the us nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be 34 million in 2006 

accounting for stock options international paper accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method compensation expense is recorded over the related service period when the market price exceeds the option price at the measurement date which is the grant date for international paper’s options no compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of international paper stock on the grant date 

during each reporting period fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that “inthemoney” options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 

under the provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” expense for stock options is measured at the grant date based on a computed fair value of options granted and then charged to expense over the related service period had this method of accounting been applied additional expense of 57 million in 2005 38 million in 2004 and 44 million in 2003 would have been recorded 

during 2003 the company decided to eliminate its stock option program for all us employees with the intent of minimizing the use of stock options globally in 2006 in the united states the stock option program was replaced with a performancebased restricted share program for approximately 1250 employees to more closely tie longterm incentive compensation to company performance on two key performance drivers return on investment roi and total shareholder return tsr as part of this shift in focus away from stock options to performancebased restricted stock the company accelerated the vesting of all 14 million unvested stock options to july 12 2005 the company also considered the benefit to employees and the income statement impact in making its decision to accelerate the vesting of these options based on the market value of the company’s common stock on july 12 2005 the exercise prices of all such stock options were above the market value and accordingly the company recorded no expense as a result of this action 

at december 31 2005 416 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share at december 31 2004 454 million options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6681 per share 

on january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modified prospective method no unvested stock options were outstanding as of this date the company believes that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

before minority interest discontinued operations extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes the company’s effective income tax rates were 49 33 and 20 for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special and unusual items that can affect the effective income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur in those years excluding these special and unusual items the effective income tax rate for 2005 was 275 of pretax earnings compared with 29 in 2004 and 19 in 2003 the decrease in the rate in 2005 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions we estimate that the 2006 effective income tax rate will be approximately 30 based on expected earnings and business conditions which are subject to change 

  

recent accounting developments 

the following represent recently issued accounting pronouncements that will affect reporting and disclosures in future periods see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of each item 

accounting changes and error corrections

accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” this interpretation clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in fasb statement no 143 refers to the fact that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation 

international paper adopted the provisions of this interpretation in the fourth quarter of 2005 with no material effect on its consolidated financial statements the company’s principal conditional asset retirement obligations relate to the potential future closure or redesign of certain of its production facilities in connection with any such activity it is possible that the company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from the facilities or to remediate in accordance with federal and state laws that govern the handling of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations at this time any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date and the company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expectedpresentvalue technique to estimate any such potential obligations accordingly the company 

does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation 

implicit variable interests 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin 46r5 “implicit variable interests under fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities” this fsp states that implicit variable interests are implied financial interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets exclusive of variable interests an implicit variable interest acts the same as an explicit variable interest except it involves the absorbing and or receiving of variability indirectly from the entity rather than directly the identification of an implicit variable interest is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances international paper applied the provisions of fsp fin 46r5 in the second quarter of 2005 with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements

inventory costs 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” this statement requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material be recognized as current period charges this statement also introduces the concept of “normal capacity” and requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities unallocated overhead must be recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 international paper believes that the adoption of sfas no 151 in 2006 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

international paper applied fin 46r to its variable interest entities in 2003 and recorded a noncash aftertax charge of 3 million as the cumulative effect of this accounting change 

legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

international paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations in all other jurisdictions in which we operate our continuing objectives are to 1 control emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 70 million was spent in 2005 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend approximately 121 million in 2006 for similar capital projects including the costs to comply with the environmental protection agency’s epa cluster rule regulations amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional environmental appropriations during the year 2007 is approximately 40 million and during the year 2008 is approximately 18 million this reduced capital forecast for 2007 and 2008 reflects the reduction in cluster rule spending and completion of significant environmental improvement projects in brazil 

on april 15 1998 the epa issued final cluster rule regulations that established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges from pulp and paper mills to be met by 2006 the projected costs included in our spending estimate related to the cluster rule regulations for the year 2006 are 56 million included in this estimate are costs associated with pulp and paper industry combustion source standards that were issued by the epa on january 12 2001 total 

  

projected cluster rule costs for 2007 through 2008 are 23 million 

the epa is continuing the development of new programs and standards such as additional wastewater discharge allocations water intake structure requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any resulting future cost requirements to our expenditure forecast international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible parties international paper has liability for cleanup of hazardous substances at 90 sites related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable international paper believes that the probable liability associated with these proceedings is approximately 50 million 

in addition to the above proceedings other remediation costs recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled approximately 50 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements as of february 2006 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations 

international paper is involved in other contractual disputes administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types while any litigation proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty we believe that the outcome of any proceeding lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened or all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

litigation 

we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of our litigation matters as well as ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of the reserves required if any for these contingencies is based largely on those assessments ultimately however the setting of reserves is based on good faith estimates and judgments which given the unpredictable nature of litigation could prove to be inaccurate as a result the reserve amounts in any given matter may change at any time in the future due to new 

unexpected developments analysis of our significant litigation activity is discussed below and further details of these and other litigation matters are discussed in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

antitrust matters 

in recent years several antitrust class action lawsuits have been filed against companies in our industry damages sought in these types of actions are often substantial and even where no wrongdoing has occurred companies must often settle rather than risk an adverse jury verdict the company has been named as a defendant in several of those lawsuits and in fact has reached favorable settlements after protracted and expensive litigation most recently in 2005 the company favorably resolved the linerboard antitrust cases which had related to allegations of industry concerted activity in the 1990s 

in light of the company’s strong commitment to antitrust compliance and of the cost to defend and resolve these class actions we have adopted a code of business ethics which applies to employees and executives alike and we also have strong systems to ensure compliance with antitrust laws regulations and our own policies we place a very high priority on training our employees on current antitrust laws around the world and proper conduct under those laws in this effort we employ both live and online training programs and the company’s antitrust compliance manual is required reading for every usbased salaried employee in addition the company has a tollfree hotline which enables employees to make anonymous reports about suspected violation of law or company policy this reporting system is also available to the general public with access information publicized on our internet site we believe that these efforts together with strong leadership about the importance of compliance will minimize the company’s exposure in this area 

with respect to our one pending antitrust certified class action the company believes that it has valid defenses and is vigorously defending these cases 

effect of inflation 

while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as energy wood fiber and chemical costs have an impact on the company’s operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 

  

foreign currency effects 

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company’s financial statements direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into us dollars indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies that have the most impact are the euro the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble 

market risk 

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to international paper’s debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities we invest in investment grade securities of financial institutions and industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer our investments in marketable securities at december 31 2005 are stated at cost which approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was immaterial 

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with international paper’s optimal capital structure while at the same time taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement the optimal capital structure at december 31 2005 and 2004 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately 86 billion and 104 billion respectively the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately 326 million and 419 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

commodity price risk 

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap and option contracts have been used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices at december 31 2005 the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contracts was immaterial at december 31 2004 there were no outstanding energy hedge contracts 

foreign currency risk 

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis through financing a portion of our investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation’s functional currency or by entering into crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2005 and 2004 the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately 211 million and 335 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately 20 million and 65 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting including the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition these controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset safeguarding and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

  

  all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to such financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding the system is supported by written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified 

as of december 31 2005 management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in a report included on page 38 management concluded that based on its assessment the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2005 

in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by us their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by deloitte  touche llp as stated in their report included herein 

management’s process to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we followed a comprehensive compliance process across the enterprise to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting engaging employees at all levels of the organization our internal control environment includes an enterprisewide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top” this is exemplified by our ethics program that includes longstanding principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of our business which have been distributed to all employees a tollfree telephone helpline whereby any employee may report suspected violations of law or our policy and an office of ethics and business practice the internal control system further includes careful selection and training of super 

  

visory and management personnel appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout the company and an extensive program of internal audits with management followup our board of directors assisted by the audit and finance committee monitors the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting procedures the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors and other matters set forth in its charter the committee which currently consists of four independent directors meets regularly with representatives of management and with the independent auditors and the internal auditor with and without management representatives in attendance to review their activities 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

the company has ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade its financial operating and supply chain systems the system upgrades will be implemented in stages by business over the next several years management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company transitioned certain support activities for selected mainframe and as400 legacy information systems to a thirdparty service provider based on posttransition testing management believes the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting for these support services

international paper benefited from a strong economy in 2004 as demand for paper and packaging products was improved from 2003 overall average price realizations were up year over year across all our major product lines except for european paper products where a strong euro attracted imports our total industry segment operating profits were up from 2003 reflecting the higher average prices and improved shipments combined with benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a more favorable product mix these positive effects were partially offset by higher input costs including wood energy and chemical costs 

looking forward to 2005 we expect demand in the first quarter to be somewhat positive although this is a seasonally slow period for many of our businesses overall demand remains solid in the united states and europe with strong order backlogs in our coated papers and bleached board businesses containerboard and box orders are also good uncoated papers’ backlogs were below prior year levels but are improving as the first quarter progresses our average price realizations for most paper and packaging products began the year well above 2004 levels reflecting the realization of previously announced price increases raw material costs especially wood polyethylene and chemical costs are expected to increase in early 2005 although energy costs should be flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 in addition pension and other benefit related costs plus supply chain expenses are expected to be higher in 2005 however interest costs will decline due to debt repayments in 2004 and the 2005 first quarter

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

executive summary

the business environment for international paper in 2003 was difficult demand
for paper and packaging products declined from 2002 average prices were also
lower than in 2002 except for wood products pulp coated papers and bleached
board total industry segment operating profits were down from 2002 as benefits
from cost reduction initiatives and improved operating performance and a more
favorable product mix were more than offset by higher energy and raw material
costs and lower prices

looking forward to 2004 we expect a seasonally slow first quarter with
continuing low prices and high wood and energy costs however due to signs of
increasing strength in us and world economies and growth in business activity
at many of our customers we expect improvements in demand as 2004 progresses
given the generally low levels of inventories at our facilities along with
better order backlogs we have announced price increases in containerboard
uncoated free sheet pulp and certain bleached board grades while these price
increases will have only a slight impact on margins in the first quarter their
benefits will progressively flow through to earnings as the year progresses the
weaker us dollar should also benefit our exports and reduce the
competitiveness of imports of competitor products into the united states the
outlook for wood products operating results as 2004 begins is favorable
forestland sales continue to be dependent upon various factors including tract
location and the level of investor interest

results of operations

industry segment operating profits are used by international papers management
to measure the earnings performance of its businesses management believes that
this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs operating
efficiencies prices and volumes industry segment operating profits are defined

items and special corporate items industry segment operating profits are
defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial
measure and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating
measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states international paper operates in six segments printing papers

the principal changes by segment were as follows printing papers profits were
68 million lower as higher raw material and energy costs were partially offset
by improved operations and lower overhead costs industrial and consumer
packagings profits were down 100 million higher raw material costs and lower
prices more than offset the effect of reduced overhead costs and improved
operations forest products profit was 41 million higher higher average
prices for wood products lower raw material costs and improved plant operations
offset the effect of lower harvest volumes and lower earnings from weldwood of
canada

corporate items a 466 million net expense in 2003 increased from 253 million
in 2002 due to higher pension and supply chain initiative costs offset in part
by gains on energy hedging transactions in addition 2002 charges were reduced
by gains from an insurance company demutualization stock sale and foreign
exchange

special items including restructuring and other charges gainslosses on sales
and impairments of businesses held for sale and reversals of reserves no longer
required declined to 290 million from 586 million in 2002 and from 18
billion in 2001 the decline in 2003 reflects lower restructuring charges that
relate to excess capacity shutdowns and sales of noncore businesses and lower
legal costs the multiyear corporate consolidation program following the
champion acquisition is now essentially complete

interest expense net decreased to 766 million in 2003 compared with 783
million in 2002 and 929 million in 2001 the decline in 2003 compared with both
2002 and 2001 is principally the result of lower interest rates from the
refinancing of high coupon rate debt

the 92 million income tax benefit in 2003 included 123 million of benefits for
significant tax items occurring in 2003 the 54 million benefit in 2002 also
reflected adjustments for special tax items the 270 million tax benefit in
2001 reflected a pretax loss due largely to restructuring and other charges

accounting changes in 2002 reflect a 12 billion charge for the adoption of the
new goodwill accounting standard

liquidity and capital resources

international paper generated 18 billion of operating cash flow in 2003
capital spending totaled 12 billion in 2003 or 71 of depreciation and
amortization expense and is anticipated to be 13 billion or 80 of
depreciation and amortization expense in 2004 we issued 24 billion of debt
and preferred securities and used the proceeds to repay 14 billion of existing
debt and preferred securities with 10 billion subsequently used to retire
additional high coupon rate debt in january 2004 approximately 25 billion of
debt including the 1 billion of debt retired in january and 300 million of
debt at carter holt harvey is scheduled for refinancing or repayment in 2004
we intend to meet these obligations with a combination of cash from operations
and refinancings in addition the holders of 11 billion of zerocoupon
convertible senior debentures have the option to require the company to
repurchase these securities in june 2004 if this occurs the repurchase can be
settled in either cash or international paper stock at the companys option our
liquidity position continues to be strong supported by existing credit
facilities that we believe to be adequate to meet future shortterm liquidity
requirements we continue to maintain an investmentgrade rating for our
longterm debt which is a core element of our overall financial strategy

our focus in 2004 will be to continue maximizing financial flexibility and
preserving liquidity while further reducing interest expense through repayment
or refinancing of high coupon rate debt

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates

accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our financial position
and results of operations and that require judgments by management include
accounting for contingent liabilities impairments of longlived assets and
goodwill pensions and postretirement benefits income taxes and accounting for
stock options

pension charges for our us plans increased by 135 million for 2003 due to a
reduction in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and an
increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses a further
increase of approximately 46 million is expected in 2004 due also to an
increase in amortization of unrecognized losses and a decrease in the assumed
discount rate the actual return on plan assets was 26 in 2003 versus a loss of
67 in 2002 in 2002 a 15 billion aftertax charge to shareholders equity
was recorded with no impact on earnings or cash flow due to a decline in the
market value of plan assets for the us qualified pension plan

recent accounting developments

while several new accounting standards and interpretations were effective for
international paper for 2003 the application of financial accounting standards
board interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest
entities an interpretation of arb no 51 had the largest impact this
resulted in several balance sheet changes including a 13 billion reduction in
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and a 10 billion increase in debt
and an income statement effect of a 3 million aftertax charge for a cumulative
effect of an accounting change

legal

claims and payments relating to exterior siding and roofing actions continue to
be in line with projections made in 2002 class action claims brought by
corrugated sheet and container purchasers were settled in 2003 for 244
million additionally a class action was certified in 2003 relating to alleged
price fixing by international papers nevamar division which was sold as part
of decorative products in late 2002 and others in sales of highpressure
laminates additional information on these matters is included in note 10 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8

corporate overview

while the operating results for international papers various business segments
are driven by a number of businessspecific factors changes in international
papers operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic
conditions in the united states europe and asia factors that

impact the demand for our products include industrial nondurable goods
production consumer spending commercial printing and advertising activity
whitecollar employment levels new home construction and repair and remodeling
activity and movements in currency exchange rates product prices also tend to
follow general economic trends and are also affected by inventory levels
currency movements and changes in worldwide operating rates in addition to
these revenuerelated factors net earnings are impacted by various cost
drivers the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs
principally wood fiber and chemical costs energy costs salary and benefits
costs including pensions and manufacturing conversion costs

the following is a discussion of international papers results of operations for
the year ended december 31 2003 and the major factors affecting these results
compared to 2002 and 2001

results of operations

for the year ended december 31 2003 international paper reported net sales of
252 billion compared with 2002 and 2001 net sales of 250 billion and 264
billion respectively international net sales including us exports totaled
84 billion or 33 of total sales in 2003 this compares to international
sales of 75 billion in 2002 and 71 billion in 2001 the increase in 2003
versus 2002 is mainly due to the translation of sales invoiced in foreign
currencies that appreciated against the us dollar export sales of 14
billion in 2003 were about flat with both 2002 and 2001

net earnings totaled 302 million 063 per share in 2003 compared with a net
loss of 880 million 183 per share in 2002 and a net loss of 12 billion
250 per share in 2001 amounts include extraordinary items and the
cumulative effect of accounting changes

earnings before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting
changes in 2003 were 315 million compared with earnings before extraordinary
items and the cumulative effect of an accounting change of 295 million in 2002
and a loss before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of an accounting
change of 11 billion in 2001 earnings in 2003 benefited from cost reduction
initiatives improved mill operations a lower effective tax rate and reduced
special charges compared with 2002 although these benefits were partially
offset by increased energy and wood fiber costs higher pension expense lower
average prices and volumes and other items see industry segment results on
pages 1620 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment

million in 2002 and 929 million in 2001 the decline in 2003 compared with both

improvement these evaluations are targeted to a focus our portfolio on our
core businesses of paper packaging and forest products b rationalize and
realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability
and close high cost facilities and c reduce costs annually strategic
operating plans are developed by each of our businesses to demonstrate that they
will achieve a return at least equal to their cost of capital over an economic
cycle if it subsequently becomes apparent that a facilitys plan will not be
achieved a decision is then made to a invest additional capital to upgrade
the facility b shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge or
c evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to
determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred under
sfas no 144

in recent years this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities
and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs
as this profit improvement initiative is ongoing it is possible that additional
charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses
should such triggering events occur

industry segment operating profit

industry segment operating profits of 18 billion in 2003 declined slightly
from 19 billion in 2002 and were about even with 2001 higher energy and raw
material costs 270 million and lower average prices 75 million were the
principal factors in the decline in 2003 partially offset by the effect of cost
reduction initiatives improved operating performance and a more favorable
product mix 245 million in 2002 industry segment operating profits
increased by approximately 150 million compared with 2001 nonprice
improvements including lower overhead and raw material costs combined with a
favorable product mix improved operating profits by about 690 million in
addition higher volume contributed another 60 million however price declines
in 2002 lowered operating profits by about 600 million

during 2003 international paper continued to focus on managing the factors it
can control and further strengthened its core businesses through a
rationalization and realignment program in july 2003 we announced a program
targeting significant additional reductions in overhead costs by late 2004
including the elimination of approximately 3000 salaried positions in the
united states additionally we are engaged in a customerdriven companywide
supply chain initiative that will enhance international papers customer
relationships and standardize processes while improving overall company
profitability ultimately the initiative will provide the foundation upon which
to build improved customer value propositions while enabling international paper
to become increasingly competitive

international paper continues to balance its production with customer orders
taking about 590000 tons of marketrelated downtime across its mill system in
2003 this was down slightly from 600000 tons in 2002

international paper faced a difficult business environment during 2003 as demand
for paper and packaging products lagged us economic growth and average prices
were weak our focus on strong operational performance and improvements to our
internal cost structure and product mix helped mitigate the impact of poor
market conditions looking forward to 2004 we anticipate a slow start in the
first quarter as energy and wood costs continue to be high while pricing remains
depressed in most businesses however there are clear signs of momentum in the
us and world economies and indications of increasing business activity at
many of our customers we believe that the actions taken over the last few years
to restructure our operations and eliminate excess manufacturing capacity to
reduce overhead costs and to focus on our customer relationships will favorably
position international paper as market conditions improve

industry segment results

printing papers

demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in
commercial printing and advertising activity direct mail volumes and for
uncoated free sheet products with changes in whitecollar employment levels
that affect the usage of copy and laser printer paper market pulp is further
affected by changes in currency rates that can enhance or disadvantage producers
in different geographic regions

principle cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency and raw material and
energy costs

printing papers net sales for 2003 increased 1 from 2002 but were down 3 from
2001 operating profits in 2003 were down 13 and 16 from 2002 and 2001
respectively lower earnings in our uncoated and coated papers businesses in
2003 more than offset improvements in our market pulp and brazilian papers
businesses higher raw material and energy costs 175 million and lower
average prices 20 million contributed to the decline in earnings versus 2002
although these were partially offset by improved mill operations and lower
overhead costs 70 million a more profitable product mix 30 million and
higher sales volumes 20 million the printing papers segment took 750000
tons of downtime during 2003 including 335000 tons of lackoforder downtime
to align production with customer demand this compared with 655000 tons of
downtime in 2002 of which 325000 tons related to lackoforders

uncoated papers sales were 48 billion in 2003 even with 2002 but down from
49 billion in 2001 overall average prices in 2003 declined from both 2002 and
2001 after some recovery in us uncoated papers pricing at the end of 2002
prices across major products began to decline in the second quarter of 2003 the
decline reflected weak customer demand which also had a negative impact on us
operating rates average prices in europe declined throughout most of 2003 as
the strong euro led to an increase in imports combined with weak western
european demand annual us and european shipping volumes in 2003 were slightly
lower than in 2002 operating profits declined 25 compared with 2002 but were
2 higher than 2001 in addition to the softer pricing and lower shipments the
business was adversely impacted by higher energy and wood costs in 2003 compared
with 2002 partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts were continued
improvements in mill operations and lower overhead expenses

coated papers sales were 14 billion in 2003 compared with 15 billion in
2002 and 16 billion in 2001 operating losses increased during 2003 compared
with 2002 the business was profitable in 2001 the decline in earnings in 2003
compared with 2002 was primarily due to higher energy and wood costs although
the effect of recent cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the losses average

market pulp sales from our us european and canadian facilities were 850
million in 2003 compared with 765 million and 815 million in 2002 and 2001
respectively operating losses decreased in 2003 compared with both 2002 and
2001 as higher average prices lower overhead costs and improved mill
operations more than offset increases in raw material costs us pulp prices
improved steadily during the first half of 2003 then declined slightly during
the third quarter before making a slight recovery in the fourth quarter us
pulp volumes in 2003 were 2 lower than 2002 primarily due to periodic hardwood
shortages during the year canadian pulp volumes were flat year over year while
european pulp volumes increased 9 from 2002

brazilian paper sales were 540 million in 2003 compared with 440 million in
2002 and 460 million in 2001 operating profits in 2003 were up 14 and 12
from 2002 and 2001 respectively shipments and average prices both increased in
2003 versus 2002 although these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable
foreign exchange rates and increased energy and chemical costs

as 2004 begins the outlook for printing papers is more encouraging although
selling prices are at or near historic lows industrywide inventory levels are
also low and improvements are expected in both customer demand and pricing as
improving economic conditions lead to increased employment and higher demand
operating rates should benefit from the shutdown of highcost industry capacity
during the second half of 2003 energy and wood costs are expected to decline
gradually in 2004 although they likely will remain above historical averages
we will continue our focus on further improvements in manufacturing efficiency
and overall cost structure

industrial and consumer packaging

demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with nondurable
industrial goods production in the united states as well as with demand for
processed foods poultry meat and agricultural products demand and pricing for
consumer packaging products correlate closely with consumer spending and general
economic activity in addition to prices and volumes major factors affecting
the profitability of both industrial and consumer packaging are raw material and
energy costs manufacturing efficiency and product mix

industrial and consumer packaging net sales for 2003 were 2 higher than 2002
and were down 1 from 2001 operating profits in 2003 were down 19 and 18 from
2002 and 2001 respectively higher raw material costs 130 million and lower
average prices 90 million resulted in a decline in 2003 operating profits
versus 2002 although improved mill operations and reduced overhead costs 90
million a more favorable productcustomer mix 10 million and increased
sales volumes 20 million helped mitigate these impacts the segment took
390000 tons of downtime during 2003 including 240000 tons of lackoforder
downtime to balance internal supply with customer demand this compared with
445000 tons of downtime in 2002 of which 270000 tons related to
lackoforders

industrial packaging net sales for 2003 were 37 billion compared with 36
billion in 2002 and were flat compared with 2001 weak us demand coupled
with pressure on pricing continued to adversely affect results for this
business operating profits in 2003 declined 14 and 32 from 2002 and 2001
respectively the impacts of lower average prices and increased raw material
costs in 2003 versus 2002 were partially offset by successful overhead cost
reduction efforts operating efficiency improvements a more favorable
productcustomer mix and a slight increase in shipments domestic box shipments
were over 3 higher than in 2002 despite soft market conditions reflecting an
improvement in market position demand for european container products was
slightly down versus 2002 but operating results improved due to higher
converting margins and cost reduction programs during 2003 the industrial
packaging business took 230000 tons of lackoforder downtime as we continued
our policy of adjusting production to be in line with customer demand

entering 2004 although prices are at low levels demand for boxes and
containerboard is expected to improve as the year progresses current order
volumes for both containerboard and boxes are strengthening while inventory
levels are at the lowest level in years as a result operating rates entering
2004 have increased and we announced price increases for containerboard and
boxes in the first quarter production realignments as well as business and
plant overhead reductions begun in late 2003 will benefit operating results in
2004 we expect the european operating results to improve as a result of
internal process improvement programs implemented in 2003

consumer packaging 2003 net sales of 25 billion were flat versus 2002 but were
lower than 2001 sales of 26 billion average prices in 2003 increased about 2
over 2002 for bleached board but were down around 3 for the converting
businesses our bleached board mills ran about at capacity for the year with
very little marketrelated downtime and shipments were up slightly over prior
year operating profits in 2003 declined 25 from 2002 but were 11

higher than in 2001 cost control programs implemented in 2003 in mills and
converting operations and improved bleached board pricing did not fully offset
the significant impact of cost increases in raw materials especially wood and
energy during 2003 manufacturing improvement rationalization and
organizational restructuring plans were implemented throughout this business to
reduce costs and improve alignment with our markets

although competitive pressures remain strong for consumer packaging entering
2004 market conditions are showing signs of improvement several key supply
agreements were finalized during the fourth quarter of 2003 with strategic
customers further strengthening our market positions progress made in 2003 in
wood yield optimization reductions of purchased energy and cost curtailment
efforts will also benefit operating results in 2004

distribution

our distribution business buys and resells a diverse array of products to
customers in the commercial printing general manufacturing and other market
segments distribution sales margins are generally stable though customer
demand and revenue are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions
business from customers in the commercial printing segment is heavily dependent
on the levels of corporate advertising and promotional spending in addition to
sales volumes and profit margins efficient customer service and logistics and
focused working capital management are key factors in this segments

xpedx our north american distribution operation posted sales of 6 billion
down 2 and 9 from 2002 and 2001 levels respectively combined sales to our
two primary us market segments commercial printing and general manufacturing
declined slightly from 2002 reflecting generally weak domestic economic
conditions

earnings in 2003 declined 13 from 2002 but remained well ahead of 2001 the
decline from 2002 was primarily due to lower average prices and sales volume
partially offset by lower operating costs and bad debt expenses the reduction
in operating costs in 2003 resulted primarily from consolidations and
operational restructuring actions taken in recent years since 2001
consolidation actions taken by xpedx have resulted in a 24 reduction in its
work force significant improvements in credit control led to decreases in bad
debt expenses of 46 and 70 from 2002 and 2001 levels respectively

european distribution operations posted sales of 375 million in 2003 even with
2002 and up 7 from 2001 the european businesses earnings increased in 2003
following a small profit in 2002 and a small loss in 2001

looking ahead to 2004 distribution will focus on increasing market share in our
primary customer segments the initiatives undertaken in recent years to reduce
overhead costs and working capital will continue distributions management
anticipates improved sales volumes as economic conditions and product prices
continue to improve during 2004

forest products

forest products manages approximately 83 million acres of forestlands in the
united states and operates wood products plants in the united states and canada
that produce lumber plywood engineered wood products and utility poles forest
resources operating results are largely driven by demand and pricing for
softwood sawtimber and to a lesser extent for softwood pulpwood by the volume
of merchantable timber on company forestlands and by demand and pricing for
specific forestland tracts offered for sale wood products operating results are
driven by new housing starts and repair and remodeling activity fiber costs are
a major factor in wood products profitability

forest products net sales for 2003 were 2 lower than in 2002 and were 6
higher than in 2001 operating profits in 2003 were 6 and 13 higher than in
2002 and 2001 respectively earnings in 2003 reflected strong contributions
from the us wood products business primarily as a result of higher average
plywood and lumber prices 50 million and reduced raw material costs and
improved plant operations 70 million lower earnings from reduced harvest
volumes in forest resources 40 million and lower earnings from weldwood of
canada 40 million due to lower prices and a stronger canadian dollar
partially offset the improved us wood products contributions

forest resources sales in 2003 were 11 billion compared with 12 billion in
2002 and 960 million in 2001 operating profit was 4 lower than in 2002 due
to lower stumpage sales and recreation income partially offset by lower
operating costs operating profit in 2003 was 2 higher than in 2001 primarily
due to lower operating costs and increased contributions from forestland sales
partially offset by lower stumpage sales and recreation income

gross margins from stumpage sales and recreational income were 268 million in
2003 down from 324 million in 2002 and 386 million in 2001 harvest volumes
declined 7 in 2003 compared with 2002 and 26 from 2001 reflecting a lower
inventory of mature sawtimber in 2003 sawtimber prices were down 11 versus
2002 and 2001 and were 30 below longterm trend line prices gross margins
from forestland sales were 462 million in 2003 about the same as 461 million
in 2002 and up from 388 million in 2001 reflecting higher average peracre
sales realizations operating expenses declined to 157 million in 2003 from
190 million in 2002 and 220 million in 2001 reflecting the impact of
restructuring and cost reduction actions operating profits for the real estate
division were 71 million 75 million and 78 million in 2003 2002 and 2001
respectively international paper monetizes its forest assets in various ways
including sales of short and longterm harvest rights on a payascut or
lumpsum bulksale basis as well as sales of timberlands

for 2004 our harvest is projected to be down due to a lower inventory of mature
timber over time harvests are expected to increase due to higher
yieldperacre initiatives and maturities of premerchantable timber inventories
average first quarter 2004 southern pine pulpwood and sawtimber prices are
expected to remain close to fourth quarter 2003 levels while hardwood pulpwood
prices should begin to decline forestland sales will continue to be dependent
upon various factors including tract location and the level of investor
interest

wood products sales in the united states in 2003 of 13 billion were even with
2002 but were slightly lower than sales of 14 billion in 2001 operating
profits in 2003 increased substantially from 2002 as a result of higher average
prices lower raw material costs and improved manufacturing operations average
2003 plywood prices rose 17 above 2002 levels and were 10 higher than 2001
plywood sales volume was flat with 2002 and was slightly higher than 2001
average prices for lumber were up 2 in 2003 versus 2002 but were flat with
2001 lumber sales volume declined 5 from 2002 and 5 from 2001 reflecting
the closures of high cost facilities during those periods both lumber and
plywood plant operations have lower manufacturing costs compared with both 2002
and 2001 wood costs also were lower in 2003 than in 2002 in 2003 the
tuskalusa and springhill lumber plants were closed eliminating approximately
200 million board feet of capacity

canadian wood products operated through weldwood of canada reported net sales
of 635 million in 2003 compared with 565 million in 2002 and 480 million in
2001 operating profits in 2003 were down 64 and 50 from 2002 and 2001
respectively the impact of a substantially stronger canadian dollar coupled
with lower average lumber prices more than offset the effect of lower raw
material costs average lumber prices in 2003 were down 17 from 2002 while
sales volumes increased 1 plywood average prices and sales volumes in 2003
were 5 higher than in 2002

the outlook for wood products operating results as 2004 begins is favorable
lumber and plywood prices began the year well above prior year levels current
low interest rates and expected improving economic conditions during 2004 should
continue to support strong construction and remodeling activity customer
inventory levels in the distribution pipeline should support strong demand in
the first part of the year negotiations to settle the uscanada softwood
lumber dispute if finalized should help market stability the business will
continue to focus on cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives and
improving its product and customer mix in 2004

carter holt harvey

carter holt harvey international papers approximately 505 owned subsidiary
operating principally in new zealand and australia is in many of the same
businesses as international paper and is thus affected by many of the same
economic factors as our other segments additionally carter holt harveys
reported operating results are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates
especially changes in the new zealand dollar versus the us dollar since most
operating costs are new zealand dollar denominated while a large portion of its
export sales are denominated in us dollars demand for wood products is
largely driven by housing and remodeling activity in australia and new zealand

international papers results shown below for this segment differ from those
reported by carter holt harvey in new zealand in three major respects

1   carter holt harveys earnings include only our share of carter holt
     harveys operating earnings segment sales however represent 100 of
     carter holt harveys sales

2   carter holt harvey reports in new zealand dollars but our segment results
     are reported in us dollars the weighted average currency exchange rate
     used to translate new zealand dollars to us dollars was 058 in 2003
     047 in 2002 and 041 in 2001

carter holt harveys 2003 us dollar net sales and operating profits were
higher than in 2002 due solely to the translation effect of the stronger new
zealand dollar in new zealand dollars total sales and operating profits
declined 6 and 8 respectively compared to 2002 levels reflecting the effect
of the strike at the kinleith mill in early 2003 and difficult trading
conditions in the forest and wood export markets

forests operating results in 2003 were lower than 2002 primarily due to lower
export and domestic log prices reflecting a stronger new zealand dollar and
higher freight costs harvest levels were reduced in 2003 as a result of these
lower prices the wood products business reported improved sales volumes
compared with 2002 as residential housing markets in australia and new zealand
continued to strengthen

the pulp and paper business earnings improved in 2003 despite the threemonth
labor strike at the kinleith mill reflecting higher average prices compared with
2002 higher earnings in the packaging business resulted from successful margin
improvement and business restructuring programs the tissue businesss 2003
operating results were about even with 2002 as the effect of lower sales volumes
was largely offset by cost reduction efforts

the outlook for operating results in 2004 is mixed housing and construction
activity in australia and new zealand is expected to remain steady after
reaching peak volumes during 2003 resulting in stable demand for domestic log
and lumber volumes in new zealand and australia the company has also continued
to build on its hedging position for 2004 with projected us dollar exposures
at around 63 hedged at a rate of us 049 the company continues to maintain
additional us dollar strategic hedges to 2007 export earnings will continue
to be adversely affected by a strong new zealand dollar somewhat offset by
improved pricing for linerboard and pulp operational improvements are expected

liquidity and capital resources

overview

a major factor in international papers liquidity and capital resource planning
is its generation of operating cash flow which in turn is highly sensitive to
changes in the pricing and demand for our major products while changes in key
cash operating costs such as energy do have an effect on operating cash
generation we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has reduced the
variability of our controllable costs over an operating cycle as a result we
believe that we are well positioned for a strong increase in future operating
cash flows as the current low average price levels for our products improve with
stronger worldwide economic conditions

as part of the program to improve international papers return on investment
capital spending levels have been focused on highreturn cost reduction and key
maintenance projects in our core businesses and kept well below depreciation
and amortization charges for each of the last three years we anticipate
continuing this approach in 2004

with the low interest rate environment in 2003 financing activities focused
largely on extending the maturities of shortterm borrowings and reducing future
interest costs through the refinancing of high coupon rate borrowings
additionally we strengthened our liquidity position extending the maturity of
our 15 billion credit facility to 2006 and increasing our receivables
securitization program to 650 million we also have an existing 750 million
credit agreement maturing in 2004 that we are in the process of restructuring
and extending we believe these facilities are adequate to meet any future
shortterm liquidity requirements

management believes it is important for international paper to maintain an
investmentgrade credit rating in order to facilitate access to favorable terms
in the capital markets

cash provided by operations

cash provided by operations totaled 18 billion for 2003 compared with 21

financing activities

financing activities during 2003 included debt and preferred security issuances
of 24 billion and retirements totaling 14 billion for a net increase of 10
billion before noncash adjustments under fin 46 see recent accounting
developments the increase reflects the timing of 1 billion of borrowings in
december 2003 to be used to retire approximately 1 billion of higher coupon
rate debt in january 2004 other 2003 financing activity included the redemption
of 550 million and the issuance of 150 million of preferred securities of

refinancing of high coupon rate debt in the last three years is one means the
company uses to manage interest expense another action to manage interest is
the use of interest rate swaps to change the mix between fixed and variable rate
debt at december 31 2003 international paper had entered into interest rate
swaps with a total notional amount of 21 billion these swaps reduced 2003
interest expense by 77 million before taxes and minority interest or 365 basis
points on 2 billion of related debt at december 31 2003 the swaps reduce
the weighted average fixed rate on the debt of 7 to an effective rate of 33
with maturities ranging from one to 11 years

dividend payments totaled 480 million in 2003 and 482 million in both 2002 and
2001 the international paper common stock dividend remained at 100 per share
during the threeyear period

at december 31 2003 and 2002 cash and temporary investments totaled 24
billion and 11 billion respectively with the increase in 2003 reflecting
funds borrowed in december to retire debt in january 2004

capital resources outlook for 2004

international paper can meet projected capital expenditures service existing
debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2004 through cash
from operations and various sources of short and longterm borrowings
international paper has approximately 31 billion of committed liquidity which
we believe is adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during
our industrys economic cycles

the company will continue to rely upon debt capital markets for the majority of
any necessary funding not provided by operating cash flow funding decisions
will be guided by our capital structure planning and liability management
practices the primary goals of the companys capital structure planning are to
maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest
expense in 2004 the company will continue to access the capital markets where
there are opportunities to replace high coupon debt with new financing
instruments at lower interest rates

maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of
international papers financing strategy at december 31 2003 the company held
longterm credit ratings of bbb negative outlook and baa2 stable outlook by
standard  poors and moodys investor services respectively the company
currently has shortterm credit ratings by standard  poors and moodys
investor services of a3 and p2 respectively

in the third quarter of 2003 in connection with a forest products industry
review standard  poors changed the outlook for international papers
longterm credit rating from bbb stable outlook to bbb negative outlook
this change in longterm credit rating did not have a significant effect on our
ability to raise longterm capital as evidenced by the 10 billion in longterm
debt issued in december 2003 and discussed above at the same time the standard
 poors shortterm rating was downgraded to a3

the change in the shortterm ratings excludes international paper from the
largest investor segment of the commercial paper market at the time of the
downgrade and at december 31 2003 international paper had no commercial

working capital funding availability of these facilities is not affected by the
change of our shortterm ratings international papers facilities include a
750 million committed bank revolving credit facility which expires march 2004
a 15 billion committed bank revolving credit facility which was put in place
in march 2003 and expires march 2006 and a 650 million assetbacked accounts
receivable securitization facility that expires in december 2004 the company
intends to restructure and extend the 750 million revolving credit facility
that expires in march 2004 with a new multiyear facility at december 31 2003
the revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility were
unused additionally at chh there is a 222 million multicurrency credit
facility put in place by chh to support its commercial paper program maturing
in two tranches 2005 and 2007

in 2003 approximately 17 billion of longterm debt with a weighted average
coupon rate of 6 and maturities ranging from four to 35 years was replaced
during 2003 with debt having a weighted average coupon rate of 48 and maturing
in four to 11 years

international paper has approximately 25 billion of debt including the 1
billion of debt retired in january and 300 million of debt at carter holt
harvey scheduled for refinancing or repayment in 2004 we intend to meet these
obligations with a combination of cash from operations and refinancing

in addition the holders of international papers zerocoupon convertible debt
have the option to require the company to repurchase these securities on june
20 2004 at a price equal to the accreted principal amount of 11 billion plus
interest the repurchase may be settled in international paper common stock or
cash or a combination of both at the companys option in an amount equal to
53 of each debentures principal amount at maturity we anticipate using a
combination of cash from operations and new debt issuances to retire and
refinance maturing debt balances and the potential repurchase of the convertible
debt issuance

contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease

scheduled for maturity in 2004 as maturing in 2006 since international paper has
the intent and ability to renew or convert these obligations through 2006 under
an existing credit agreement purchase obligations represent contractual
agreements to purchase goods or services that are not cancellable without
penalty

funding requirements for pension and postretirement plans are discussed in notes
15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial
statements and supplementary disclosures

the majority of international papers debt is accessed through global public
capital markets where we have a wide base of investors the company was well
within the requirements for compliance with all its debt covenants at december
31 2003 principal financial covenants include maintenance of a minimum net
worth as defined of 9 billion and a maximum total debt to capital ratio as
defined of 60

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the united states requires international paper to
establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts
and timing of the recording of assets liabilities revenues and expenses some
of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently
uncertain

accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the
reported results of operations and financial position of international paper
and that can require judgments by management that affect their application
include sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies sfas no 144 accounting
for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 142 goodwill
and other intangible assets sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions
and sfas no 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions as amended by sfas no 132 and 132r employers disclosures about
pension and other postretirement benefits and sfas no 109 accounting for
income taxes the following is a discussion of the impact of these accounting
policies on international paper

contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities including legal and
environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding
projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and
recommendations of legal counsel additionally as discussed in note 10 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data reserves for projected future claims settlements relating to
exterior siding products previously manufactured by masonite require judgments
regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts international paper
utilizes independent third parties to assist


                                       23

in developing these estimates liabilities for environmental matters require
evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future
remediation alternatives and costs international paper determines these
estimates after a detailed evaluation of each site

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill an impairment of a longlived
asset exists when the assets carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is
recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations
a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets and
goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations
additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and
intangible asset balances is required annually the amount and timing of
impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows
and the fair market value of the related assets

pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension
and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in
conjunction with international papers consulting actuary and are dependent
upon various assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan
assets discount rates projected future compensation increases health care
cost trend rates and mortality rates

income taxes international paper records provisions for us federal state and
foreign income taxes based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the
jurisdictions in which it operates and judgments as to the allocation of income
and the amount of deductions relating to those jurisdictions domestic and
foreign tax authorities frequently challenge the timing and amounts of these
income allocations and deductions international paper records reserves for
estimated taxes payable and for projected settlements of these disputes
however the final resolution of these challenges can differ from estimated
amounts

while the judgments and estimates made by international paper are based on
historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are
appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances actual resolution of
these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts resulting in charges
or credits that could materially affect future financial statements

significant accounting estimates

pension and postretirement benefit accounting the calculations of pension and
postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number
of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts
including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount
rate used to calculate plan liabilities the projected rate of future
compensation increases and health care cost trend rates

benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2003 for
international papers pension and postretirement plans are as follows

the table below shows the assumptions that were used by international paper to
calculate us pension expenses for the years shown

additionally the following assumptions including health care cost trend rates
were used in the calculation of us postretirement expenses for the years
shown




                                                             2003   2002   2001

international paper determines these actuarial assumptions after consultation
with our actuaries on december 31 of each year to calculate liability
information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the
following year the discount rate assumption is determined based on the internal
rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds moodys aa corporate
bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash
flows

the expected longterm rate of return reflects projected returns for an
investment mix determined upon completion of a detailed assetliability study
that meets the plans investment objectives increasing decreasing the
expected

longterm rate of return on us plan assets by an additional 025 would
decrease increase 2004 pension expense by approximately 17 million while a
decrease increase of 025 in the discount rate would increase decrease
pension expense by approximately 17 million the effect of net postretirement
benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease in the annual trend rate would be
approximately 4 million

sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions provides for delayed
recognition of actuarial gains and losses including amounts arising from
changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the
assumed discount rate differences between the actual and expected return on
plan assets and other assumption changes these net gains and losses are
recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the
average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive
benefits under the plans approximately 15 years to the extent that they are
not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years at december 31 2003
unrecognized net actuarial losses for international papers us pension plans
totaled approximately 26 billion principally reflecting declines in the fair
value of plan assets and discount rates during 20002002 offset somewhat by
gains from stronger than projected asset returns in 2003 while actual future
amortization charges will be affected by future gainslosses amortization of
cumulative unrecognized losses as of december 31 2003 is expected to increase
us pension expense by approximately 30 million in 2004 20 million in 2005
and 10 million in 2006

net periodic pension and postretirement plan expense income calculated for
international papers us plans using the assumptions above were as follows

a excludes 109 million 07 million and 660 million of expense in 2003
2002 and 2001 respectively for curtailments settlements and special
termination benefits related to divestitures and restructurings that were
recorded in restructuring and other charges and net gains losses on sales and
impairments of businesses held for sale in the consolidated statement of
earnings

the change in 2003 to net pension expense from income in 2002 for us plans was
principally due to a reduction in the expected longterm rate of return on plan
assets and an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses
with smaller impacts from reductions in the assumed discount rate and the
assumed rate of future compensation increase the decrease in pension income for
us plans in 2002 was principally due to reductions in the expected longterm
rate of return on plan assets and reductions in the assumed discount rate and in
the assumed rate of future compensation increase

for 2004 net pension expense is expected to increase by approximately 46
million principally reflecting the 30 million increase in amortization of
unrecognized actuarial losses discussed above and approximately 16 million
from a decrease in the assumed discount rate to 600 in 2004 from 650 in
2003

the market value of plan assets for international papers us plan at december
31 2003 totaled approximately 64 billion consisting of approximately 62
equity securities 27 fixed income securities and 11 real estate and other
assets plan assets did not include international paper common stock

while international paper may elect to make voluntary contributions to its us
qualified plan in the coming years it is unlikely that any minimum
contributions to the plan will be required before at least 2006 unless interest
rates decline below current levels or investment performance is significantly
below projections the us nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of
benefits paid which are expected to be 46 million in 2004

at december 31 2002 the market value of plan assets was less than the
accumulated benefit obligation abo for international papers us qualified
pension plan as a result as required under us generally accepted accounting
principles a prepaid benefit cost of approximately 17 billion at december 31
2002 was reversed and an additional minimum liability of approximately 27
billion was established by an aftertax charge of approximately 15 billion to
accumulated other comprehensive income oci with no impact on earnings or cash
flow this reduction of shareholders equity had no adverse effect on
international papers debt covenants

at december 31 2003 the strong actual return on plan assets in 2003 had
increased the market value of plan assets by more than the increase in the abo
resulting in a decrease since december 31 2002 in the required additional
minimum pension liability as a result an aftertax credit to oci of 163

accounting for stock options international paper accounts for stock options
using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock
issued to employees under this method compensation expense is recorded over
the related service period when the market price exceeds the option price at the
measurement date which is the grant date for international papers options no
compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an exercise price
equal to the market price of international paper stock on the grant date

during each reporting period fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by
assuming that inthemoney options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are
used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually
exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included
in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported
earnings equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper
will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their
individual tax returns

under the provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation
expense for stock options is measured at the grant date based on a computed fair
value of options granted and then charged to expense over the related service
period had this method of accounting been applied additional expense of 44
million in 2003 41 million in 2002 and 53 million in 2001 would have been
recorded decreasing reported earnings per share by 14 to 54 in 2003 5 to
192 in 2002 and 4 to 260 in 2001

at december 31 2003 428 million options were outstanding with exercise prices
ranging from 2931 to 6963 per share at december 31 2002 372 million
options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from 2931 to 6963 per
share

income taxes

before minority interest extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of
accounting changes the effective income tax rates were 27 15 and 21 for
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these effective tax rates include the tax
effects of certain special and unusual items that can affect the effective
income tax rate in a given year but may not recur in subsequent years
management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these
special or unusual items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be
expected in future years if no additional special or unusual items were to occur
in those years excluding these special and unusual items the effective income
tax rate for 2003 was 22 of pretax earnings compared with 29 in 2002 and 28
in 2001 the decrease in the rate in 2003 reflects a higher proportion of
taxable income in jurisdictions having a lower tax rate the effective income
tax rates were less than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily because
of this geographic mix of taxable earnings and the impact of tax credits we
estimate that the 2004 effective income tax rate will be approximately 31 based
on expected earnings and business conditions which are subject to change

recent accounting developments

consolidation of variable interest entities

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation
of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 this
interpretation changed existing consolidation rules for certain entities those
in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance the entitys activities without additional subordinated financial
support

the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities vies
created after january 31 2003 and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an
interest after that date international paper neither entered into nor obtained
an interest in any vies after january 31 2003 for vies created before
february 1 2003 this interpretation was effective for the first reporting
period ending after december 15 2003 although early application of the
provisions of this interpretation was allowed during december 2003 the fasb
issued a revision to fin 46 fin 46r with varying effective dates
international paper applied fin 46r to its variable interest entities as of
december 31 2003

as a result of the application of the provisions of fin 46r during 2003 four
entities that were required to be consolidated under prior accounting rules were
deconsolidated and one previously unconsolidated entity was consolidated at
december 31 2003


                                       26




page

the cumulative effect of adoption of fin 46r amounted to a 3 million charge
after taxes as a result of this adoption certain preferred securities were
replaced by debt obligations and 44 million was recorded as interest expense
in the last half of 2003 replacing preferred dividends that would have been
recorded as minority interest expense

the following table summarizes increases decreases in the 2003 consolidated
balance sheet captions resulting from the application of fin 46r the primary
changes are a decrease in mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
approximately 13 billion and an increase in debt of 10 billion

financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it established
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity this standard
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31
2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after june 15 2003 international paper adopted this standard during
the third quarter ended september 30 2003 with no material effect on the
companys financial position or results of operations

costs associated with exit or disposal activities

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities the statement changed the measurement and
timing of recognition for exit costs including restructuring charges and was
effective for activities initiated after december 31 2002 it requires that a
liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity such as
onetime termination benefits be recognized when the liability is incurred
rather than at the date of a companys commitment to an exit plan it had no
effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to december 31 2002
international paper adopted this standard effective january 1 2003 with no
material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations

impairment and disposal of longlived assets

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets it established a single accounting model for the
impairment of longlived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale
or abandonment and broadened the definition of discontinued operations
international paper adopted sfas no 144 in 2002 with no significant change in
the accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets

asset retirement obligations

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations it requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the
present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of
longlived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists the asset is
required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility
and the liability accreted each year using a creditadjusted riskfree rate

international paper adopted sfas no 143 effective january 1 2003 recording a
discounted liability of 22 million an increase in property plant and
equipment net of 7 million and a onetime cumulative effect charge of 10
million net of a deferred tax benefit of 5 million the pro forma effects on
earnings loss before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting
changes and net earnings for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001
assuming the adoption of sfas no 143 as of january 1 2001 were not material
to net earnings or earnings per share

goodwill

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets it changed the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill
amortization beginning in 2002 it also requires at least an annual assessment
of recorded goodwill for impairment the initial test for impairment had to be
completed by december 31 2002 with any impairment charge recorded as a
cumulative effect of accounting change to be retroactively reflected in the
first quarter of 2002 any subsequent impairment charges would be recorded in
operating results


                                       27




page

the initial test compared the fair value of each of international papers
business reporting units having recorded goodwill balances with the business
units carrying amount fair value was determined using discounted projected
future operating cash flows for all business reporting units except carter holt
harvey where the average quoted market price for carter holt harvey shares was
used where the carrying amount exceeded fair value additional testing was
performed for possible goodwill impairment the fair value for these business
reporting units was then allocated to individual assets and liabilities using a
depreciated replacement cost approach for fixed assets and outside appraised
values for intangible assets any excess of fair value over the allocated
amounts was equal to the implied fair value of goodwill where this implied
goodwill value was less than the goodwill book value of the business reporting
unit an impairment charge was recorded

based on testing completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 a transitional
goodwill impairment loss was recorded for the industrial and consumer packaging
carter holt harvey and printing papers business segments totaling 12 billion
this charge had no impact on cash flow

international paper ceased recording goodwill amortization effective january 1
2002 this had no effect on cash flow

derivatives and hedging

on january 1 2001 international paper adopted sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 138
and 149 the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 133 was a 25 million charge
to net earnings before taxes and minority interest 16 million after taxes and
minority interest and a net decrease of 9 million after taxes in oci the
charge to net earnings primarily resulted from recording the fair value of
certain interest rate swaps which do not qualify under the new rules for hedge
accounting treatment the decrease in oci primarily resulted from adjusting the
foreign currency contracts used as hedges of net investments in foreign
operations to fair value

litigation issues

environmental matters

international paper is subject to extensive u s federal and state
environmental regulation as well as similar regulations in all other
jurisdictions in which we operate our continuing objectives are to 1 control
emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air water and groundwater
to avoid adverse impacts on the environment 2 make continual improvements in
environmental performance and 3 maintain 100 compliance with applicable laws
and regulations a total of 88 million was spent in 2003 for capital projects
to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure
environmentally sound management and disposal of waste we expect to spend
approximately 116 million in 2004 for similar capital projects including the
costs to comply with the environmental protection agencys epa cluster rule
regulations amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future
years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements
and environmental concerns taking these uncertainties into account our
preliminary estimate for additional environmental appropriations during the year
2005 is approximately 181 million and during the year 2006 is approximately
149 million

on april 15 1998 the epa issued final cluster rule regulations that
established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges
from pulp and paper mills to be met by 2006 the projected costs included in our
estimate related to the cluster rule regulations for the year 2004 are 57
million included in this estimate are costs associated with pulp and paper
industry combustion source standards that were issued by the epa on january 12
2001 total projected cluster rule costs for 2005 through 2006 are 192 million

in 2004 the epa is expected to issue new standards for industrial boiler
hazardous air emission controls the costs to comply with this new rule are
estimated to be 56 million from 2004 through 2006

the epa is continuing development of new programs and standards such as
additional wastewater discharge allocations and water intake structure
requirements and national ambient air quality standards when regulatory
requirements for new and changing standards are finalized we will add any
resulting future cost projections to our expenditure forecast

international paper has been named as a potentially liable party in a number of
environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws
including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability
act cercla related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they
are probable and reasonably estimable as of december 31 2003 these
liabilities totaled approximately 25 million in addition to cercla other
remediation costs recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet totaled
approximately 73 million completion of these actions is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations a
discussion of cercla proceedings can be found below

in february 2000 the town of lyman south carolina issued an administrative
order alleging past violations of a wastewater pretreatment permit at the former
union camp folding carton facility in spartanburg south carolina international
paper has satisfied the terms of the order and in march 2003 agreed to resolve
the matter for a payment of 400000 for past wastewater treatment fees and
other expenses allegedly incurred by the town of lyman

in connection with the epas wellpublicized psd air permit enforcement
initiative against the paper industry the epa has issued requests for
information related to air permit compliance to five international paper mills
as of february 2004 none of these requests for information has resulted in
enforcement actions

in march 2003 the epa notified the company that it intends to initiate an
enforcement action alleging hazardous waste deficiencies at the companys
treated pole facility in joplin missouri on october 10 2003 the company was
served with a civil administrative complaint seeking a civil penalty of
673969 the company and the epa are pursuing settlement discussions

as of february 2004 there were no other pending judicial proceedings brought
by government authorities against international paper for alleged violations of
applicable environmental laws or regulations international paper is engaged in
various other proceedings that arise under applicable environmental and safety
laws or regulations including approximately 117 active proceedings under cercla
and comparable state laws most of these proceedings involve the cleanup of
hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many
different sources while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla
as a practical matter liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many
potential responsible parties based upon previous experience with respect to
the cleanup of hazardous substances and upon presently available information
international paper believes that it has no or de minimis liability with
respect to 20 of these sites that liability is not likely to be significant at
55 sites and that estimates of liability at the other 42 sites is likely to be
significant but not material to international papers consolidated financial
position or results of operations international paper believes that the
probable liability associated with all of the cercla proceedings is
approximately 57 million

litigation

see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8
financial statements and supplementary data for a detailed discussion of each
of the following litigation matters

exterior siding and roofing litigation three nationwide class action lawsuits
filed against international paper have been settled in recent years provisions
of 225 million and 450 million were recorded in 2001 and 2002 respectively
to increase existing reserve balances to projected settlement amounts at
december 31 2003 reserves for these actions totaled 387 million

insurance matters in connection with one of the exterior siding and roofing
actions above international paper commenced a lawsuit against certain insurance
carriers relating to their refusal to indemnify international paper and in the
case of one insurance carrier also for its refusal to provide a defense in
july 2003 a jury determined that 383 million of international papers payments
to settle these claims are covered by its insurance policies international
paper is engaged in further court proceedings to determine each carriers
allocable share international paper is also participating in courtordered
mediation with a number of these insurance carriers

in addition international paper was involved in a dispute with a third party
regarding 100 million of payments made to international paper under an
alternative risktransfer agreement in february 2004 an agreement was reached
whereby international paper agreed to pay the third party a portion of future
insurance proceeds as they are recovered by international paper beginning in
2004 up to a maximum of 95 million

antitrust matters in 1999 two lawsuits were filed in federal court against
international paper and other manufacturers of linerboard alleging that they
conspired to fix prices for corrugated sheets and containers during the period
from october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 international paper settled
these claims along with claims brought against union camp in 2003 for 244
million

in 2000 direct and indirect purchasers of highpressure laminates hpl filed
various suits in federal and state court alleging that hpl manufacturers
conspired to fix prices a class was certified in the consolidated federal case
in 2003 while the state cases have been stayed

international paper is involved in other contractual disputes administrative
and legal proceedings and investigations of various types while any litigation
proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty we believe that the
outcome of any proceeding lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened or
all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations

effect of inflation

general inflation has had minimal impact on our operating results in the last
three years sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and
demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by
inflationary factors

foreign currency effects

international paper has operations in a number of countries its operations in
those countries also export to and compete with imports from other regions as
such currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the
companys financial statements direct impacts include the translation of
international operations local currency financial statements into us dollars
indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into and
exports out of the united states and the impact on local currency pricing of
products that are traded internationally in general a lower us dollar and
stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper the currencies
that have the most impact are the euro the canadian dollar the new zealand
dollar the brazilian real the polish zloty and the russian ruble

market risk

we use financial instruments including fixed and variable rate debt to finance
operations for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes
additionally financial instruments including various derivative contracts are
used to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and foreign currency risks
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes information related to
international papers debt obligations is included in note 12 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is
included in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8
financial statements and supplementary data

the fair value of our debt and other financial instruments varies due to changes
in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the
inception of the related intruments we assess this market risk utilizing a
sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in
earnings fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change
increase and decrease in interest and currency rates and commodity prices

interest rate risk

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
short and longterm debt obligations and investments in marketable securities
we invest in investment grade securities of financial institutions and
industrial companies and limit exposure to any one issuer our investments in
marketable securities at december 31 2003 are stated at cost which
approximates market due to their shortterm nature our interest rate risk
exposure related to these investments was immaterial

we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion consistent with
international papers optimal capital structure while at the same time taking
advantage of market opportunities to reduce interest expense as appropriate
derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps may be used to implement
the optimal capital structure at december 31 2003 and 2002 the net fair value
liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was
approximately 118 billion and 102 billion respectively the potential loss
in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse shift in quoted interest rates would
be approximately 430 million and 325 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively

commodity price risk

the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in
earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities commodity swap
and option contracts are currently used to manage risks associated with market
fluctuations in energy prices at december 31 2003 and 2002 the net fair value
of such contracts was a 5 million asset and an 18 million asset respectively
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10 adverse change in the
underlying commodity prices would be immaterial for both 2003 and 2002

foreign currency risk

international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to
currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and
operated in foreign countries our objective in managing the associated foreign
currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations
on our aftertax cash flows we address these risks on a limited basis through
financing a portion of our


                                       30

investments in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in the same
currency as the operations functional currency or by entering into longterm
crosscurrency and interest rate swaps or shortterm foreign exchange
contracts at december 31 2003 and 2002 the net fair value liability of
financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately
540 million and 570 million respectively the potential loss in fair value
for such financial instruments from a 10 adverse change in quoted foreign
currency exchange rates would be immaterial for both 2003 and 2002

treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost which approximates market

inventories

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and includes all costs
directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and
manufacturing overhead in the united states costs of raw materials and
finished pulp and paper products are generally determined using the lastin
firstout method other inventories are valued using the firstin firstout or
average cost methods

plants properties and equipment

repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred the unitsofproduction method
of depreciation is used for major pulp and paper mills and certain wood products
facilities and the straightline method for other plants and equipment annual

forestlands

at december 31 2003 international paper and its subsidiaries controlled about
83 million acres of forestlands in the united states 15 million acres in
brazil 795000 acres in new zealand and had through licenses and forest
management agreements harvesting rights on governmentowned forestlands in
canada and russia forestlands include owned property as well as certain timber
harvesting rights with terms of one or more years and are stated at cost less
cost of timber harvested coth costs attributable to timber are charged
against income as trees are cut the rate charged is determined annually based
on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume

effective january 1 2002 international paper prospectively changed its method
of accounting for midrotation fertilization expenditures to include such
expenditures in the capitalized cost of forestlands accordingly these costs
have


                                       40




page

been subsequently included as part of the coth as trees are sold prior to this
change these expenditures were capitalized and amortized to expense over a
fiveyear period the change was made to better match the total costs of fiber
to the related income when the trees are sold this accounting change had no
material effect on earnings for the year ended december 31 2002 and the
effects in future years will not be significant due to the cumulative nature of
the coth computation calculation of the cumulative effect of the accounting
change on prior periods of including these costs as part of coth and disclosure
of pro forma amounts for prior years are not determinable

goodwill

prior to 2002 goodwill was amortized over its estimated period of benefit on a
straightline basis not to exceed 40 years effective january 1 2002
international paper adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas
no 142 eliminating the periodic charge to earnings for goodwill amortization
for 2002 and future years in addition as required by sfas no 142 an initial
assessment of recorded goodwill for possible impairment was conducted as of
january 1 2002 annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed as
of the end of the third quarter of each year a transitional impairment charge
of 12 billion was recorded upon the initial adoption of this standard in 2002
no additional impairment charges were recorded in 2003 or 2002

goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of
the applicable segment while goodwill arising from major acquisitions that
involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset for
segment reporting purposes for goodwill impairment testing this goodwill was
allocated to business segments

the following tables present changes in the goodwill balances as allocated to
each business segment for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002

a excludes a 61 million credit to minority interest expense

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or
changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may
not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use impaired assets
are recorded at estimated fair value determined principally using discounted
future cash flows

income taxes

international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax
assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate
changes are enacted

stockbased compensation

stock options and other stockbased compensation awards are accounted for using
the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion
apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related
interpretations see note 17 for required pro forma and additional disclosures
relating to these awards

environmental remediation costs

costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when
such costs are probable and reasonably estimable such accruals are adjusted as
further information develops or circumstances change costs of future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their
present value when the expected cash flows are reliably determinable

asset retirement obligations

in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations adopted effective january 1 2003 see note 4 a
liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated
costs associated with the retirement of longlived assets where a legal or
contractual obligation exists the liability is accreted over time and the asset
is depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility international
papers asset retirement obligations under this standard relate to closure costs
for landfills revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the
estimated costs or timing of closures or possible new federal or state
regulations affecting these closures

the following table presents an analysis of activity related to the asset
retirement obligation since january 1 2003

translation of financial statements

balance sheets of international operations are translated into us dollars at
yearend exchange rates while statements of earnings are translated at average
rates adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included
as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss oci see note 13 related to derivatives and hedging activities

reclassifications

certain reclassifications have been made to prioryear amounts to conform with
the current year presentation

note 2 earnings per common share

earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative
effect of accounting changes are computed by dividing earnings loss before
extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding earnings loss per common share
before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming
dilution were computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities
including inthemoney stock options were converted into common shares at the
beginning of each year

a reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of earnings loss
per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting
changes and earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and
cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming dilution is as follows

note 4 recent accounting developments

consolidation of variable interest entities

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an
interpretation of arb no 51 this interpretation changed existing
consolidation rules for certain entities those in which equity investors do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance the entitys activities
without additional subordinated financial support

the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities vies
created after january 31 2003 and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an
interest after that date international paper neither entered into nor obtained
an interest in any vies after january 31 2003 for vies created before
february 1 2003 this interpretation was effective for the first reporting
period ending after december 15 2003 although early application of the
provisions of this interpretation was allowed during december 2003 the fasb
issued a revision to fin 46 fin 46r with varying effective dates
international paper applied fin 46r to its variable interest entities as of
december 31 2003

as a result of the application of the provisions of fin 46r during 2003 four
entities that were required to be consolidated under prior accounting rules were
deconsolidated and one previously unconsolidated entity was consolidated at
december 31 2003 the following paragraphs describe the entities affected by
the new fin 46r consolidation rules and the effects on international papers
december 31 2003 financial statements

a  a special purpose leasing entity that was formerly part of an operating
     lease arrangement between international paper and a third party was
     determined to be a vie and required to be consolidated by the company
     plants properties and equipment and longterm debt of approximately 50
     million that were formerly part of this operating lease arrangement were
     consolidated and a noncash aftertax charge of 3 million was recorded as
     the cumulative effect of an accounting change

b  in connection with a forestlands sale in 2001 international paper received
     notes having a value of approximately 480 million on the date of sale
     during 2001 international paper contributed the notes to an unconsolidated
     entity in exchange for a preferred interest in that entity valued at
     approximately 480 million and accounted for this transfer as a sale of
     the notes for financial reporting purposes with no associated gain or loss
     also during 2001 the entity acquired approximately 561 million of other
     international paper debt obligations for cash

     in december 2002 international paper acquired an option to purchase the
     third partys interest in the unconsolidated entity and modified the terms
     of the entitys special loss allocation between the third party and
     international paper these actions required the entity to be consolidated
     by international paper at december 31 2002 resulting in increases in
     installment notes receivable included in deferred charges and other
     assets of 480 million longterm debt of 460 million and minority
     interest of 20 million

     in the fourth quarter of 2003 international paper determined that it is
     not the primary beneficiary of the entity under the provisions of fin 46r
     and accordingly deconsolidated the entity effective december 31 2003 at
     december 31 2003 international papers 530 million preferred interest in
     the entity has been offset against 530 million of international paper debt
     obligations since international paper has and intends to effect a legal
     right to net settle these two amounts

c  in a similar transaction completed in june 2002 approximately 400 million
     of installment notes received in connection with the sale of forestlands in
     various states were transferred to a consolidated entity in exchange for a
     preferred interest in the entity in the same period the entity acquired
     international paper debt obligations of 450 million for cash under the
     provisions of fin 46r international paper is not the primary beneficiary
     of this entity resulting in its deconsolidation as of december 31 2003
     the deconsolidation increased investments by 465 million longterm debt
     by 100 million and decreased notes receivable by 415 million and
     minority interest by 50 million

d  in the third quarter of 2003 international paper capital trust and
     international paper capital trust iii the trusts were determined to be
     vies for which international paper is not the primary beneficiary prior
     to july 1 2003 the trusts had been consolidated in the companys
     financial statements and the preferred securities of the trusts of
     approximately 13 billion were presented in the consolidated balance sheet
     as international paper  obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
     securities of subsidiaries holding international paper debentures
     effective july 1 2003 the trusts were deconsolidated and the previously
     consolidated

financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it established
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity this standard
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31
2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after june 15 2003 international paper adopted this standard during
the third quarter ended september 30 2003 with no material effect on the
companys financial position or results of operations

costs associated with exit or disposal activities

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities the statement changed the measurement and
timing of recognition for exit costs including restructuring charges and was
effective for activities initiated after december 31 2002 it requires that a
liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity such as
onetime termination benefits be recognized when the liability is incurred
rather than at the date of a companys commitment to an exit plan it had no
effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to december 31 2002
international paper adopted this standard effective january 1 2003 with no
material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations

impairment and disposal of longlived assets

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets it established a single accounting model for the
impairment of longlived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale
or abandonment and broadened the definition of discontinued operations
international paper adopted sfas no 144 in 2002 with no significant change in
the accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets

asset retirement obligations

required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility
and the liability accreted each year using a creditadjusted riskfree rate

earnings for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 assuming the adoption
of sfas no 143 as of january 1 2001 were not material to net earnings or
earnings per share

goodwill

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets it changed the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill
amortization beginning in 2002 it also requires at least an annual assessment
of recorded goodwill for impairment the initial test for impairment had to be
completed by december 31 2002 with any impairment charge recorded as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change to be retroactively reflected in the
first quarter of 2002 any subsequent impairment charges are to be recorded in
operating results

the initial test compared the fair value of each of international papers
business reporting units having recorded goodwill balances with the business
units carrying amount fair value was determined using discounted projected
future operating cash flows for all business reporting units except chh where
the average quoted market price for chh shares was used where the carrying
amount exceeded fair value additional testing was performed for possible
goodwill impairment the fair value for these business reporting units was then
allocated to individual assets and liabilities using a depreciated replacement
cost approach for fixed assets and appraised values for intangible assets any
excess of fair value over the allocated amounts was equal to the implied fair
value of goodwill where this implied goodwill value was less than the goodwill
book value of the business reporting unit an impairment charge was recorded

based on testing completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 a transitional
goodwill impairment loss was recorded for the industrial and consumer packaging
chh and printing papers business segments totaling 12 billion this charge had
no impact on cash flow

international paper ceased recording goodwill amortization effective january 1
2002 this had no effect on cash flow

derivatives and hedging

on january 1 2001 international paper adopted sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as subsequently amended by sfas
nos 137 138 and 149 the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 133 was a 25
million charge to net earnings before taxes and minority interest 16 million
after taxes and minority interest and a net decrease of 9 million after taxes
in oci the charge to net earnings primarily resulted from recording the fair
value of certain interest rate swaps which do not qualify under the new rules
for hedge accounting treatment the decrease in oci primarily resulted from
adjusting the foreign currency contracts used as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations to fair value

fiberboard plant in tasmania for 28 million in cash

an unsecured contractual credit agreement of an unrelated third party customer
the guarantee which expires in 2008 was made in exchange for a tenyear
contract as the exclusive paper supplier to the customer both the loan to the
customer and the guarantee are unsecured international paper would be required
to perform under the guarantee upon default on the loan by the unrelated third
party the maximum amount of potential future payments is 110 million in
principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest there is no liability recorded
on international papers books for the guarantee

in connection with sales of businesses property equipment forestlands and
other assets international paper commonly makes representations and warranties
relating to such businesses or assets and may enter into standard commercial
indemnification arrangements with respect to tax and environmental liabilities
and other matters where any liabilities for such matters are probable and
subject to reasonable estimation accrued liabilities are recorded at the time
of sale as a cost of the transaction international paper believes that possible
future unrecorded liabilities for these matters if any would not have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations

exterior siding and roofing litigation

three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing
products manufactured by masonite that were filed against international paper
have been settled in recent years

the first suit entitled judy naef v masonite and international paper was
filed in december 1994 hardboard lawsuit the plaintiffs alleged that
hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails prematurely allowing moisture
intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding the
class consisted of all us property owners having masonite hardboard siding
installed on and incorporated into buildings between january 1 1980 and january
15 1998 the court granted final approval of the settlement on january 15
1998 the settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting
the settlement requirements on a claimsmade basis which requires a class
member to individually submit proof of damage to or caused by masonite
product proof of square footage involved and proofs of various other matters
in order to qualify for payment with respect to a claim it also provides for
the payment of attorneys fees equaling 15 of the settlement amounts paid to
class members with a nonrefundable advance of 475 million plus 25 million
in costs those amounts were paid to class counsel in 1998 for siding that was
installed between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 claims must be made by
january 15 2005 and for siding installed between january 1 1990 through
january 15 1998 claims must be made by january 15 2008

the second suit entitled cosby et al v masonite corporation et al was
filed in 1997 omniwood lawsuit the plaintiffs made allegations with regard to
omniwood siding manufactured by masonite which were similar to those alleged in
the hardboard lawsuit the class consisted of all us property owners having
omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january 1
1992 to january 6 1999 the settlement relating to the omniwood lawsuit
provides that qualified claims must be made by january 6 2009 for omniwood
siding that was installed between january 1 1992 and january 6 1999

the third suit entitled smith et al v masonite corporation et al was
filed in 1995 woodruf lawsuit the plaintiffs alleged that woodruf roofing
manufactured by masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure
underneath the roofing the class consisted of all us property owners who had
incorporated and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january 1 1980 to
january 6 1999 the settlement relating to the woodruf lawsuit provides that
for product installed between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 claims must
be made by january 6 2006 and for product installed between january 1 1990
and january 6 1999 claims must be made by january 6 2009

the court granted final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf
lawsuits on january 6 1999 the settlements provide for monetary compensation
to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claimsmade basis
which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to or
caused by masonite product proof of square footage involved and proofs of
various other matters the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys
fees equaling 13 of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a
nonrefundable advance of 17 million plus 75000 in costs for each of the two
cases those amounts were paid in 1999

claim filing and determination

once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement
covering the claim the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a
negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreement
designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure the
compensation formula is based on 1 the average cost per square foot for
product replacement including material and labor as calculated by industry
standards in the area in which the structure is located adjusted for
inflation or 2 the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry
standards in such area adjusted for inflation persons receiving compensation
pursuant to this formula also agree to release international paper and masonite
from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question

in connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above where
there is damage the process of degradation once begun continues until repairs
are made international paper estimates that approximately four million
structures have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard
lawsuit 300000 structures have installed products that are subject to the
omniwood lawsuit and 86000 structures have installed products that are the
subject of the woodruf lawsuit masonite stopped selling the products involved
in the hardboard lawsuit in may 2001 the products involved in the woodruf
lawsuit in may 1996 and the products involved in the omniwood lawsuit in
september 1996

persons who are class members under the hardboard omniwood and woodruf lawsuits
who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining
to such suits may have recourse to warranties if any in existence at the
expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements
for making claims the warranty period generally extends for 25 years following
the installation of the product in question and although the warranties vary
from product to product they generally provide for a payment of up to two times
the purchase price

additional provisions

in the third quarter of 2001 a determination was made that an additional
provision would be required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves that
had arisen since the third quarter of 2000 due to actual claims experience
exceeding projections an additional 225 million was added to the existing
reserve balance at that time this increase was based on an independent third
party statistical study of future costs which analyzed trends in the claims
experience through august 31 2001 the amount was based on a statistical
outcome that assumed that hardboard claims growth continued through mid2002
then declined by 50 per year omniwood claims growth was assumed to continue
through mid2002 decline by 50 in 2003 and thereafter increase at the rate of
10 per year woodruf claims were assumed to decline at a rate of 50 per year
unit costs per claim were assumed to hold at the 2001 level the statistical
model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the geographic
patterns of claims rates and assumptions related to the cost of claims
including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation average claim costs were
calculated from historical claims records taking into consideration structure
type location and source of the claim

during 2002 tracking of the actual versus projected number of claims filed and
average cost per claim indicated that although total claims costs were
approximately equal to projected amounts the number of claims filed was higher
than projected offsetting the effect of lower average claims payment amounts
accordingly updated projections were developed by two independent consultants
utilizing the most current claims experience data principal assumptions used in
the development of these projections were that the number of hardboard claims
filed which account for approximately 85 of all claims costs would average
slightly above current levels until january 2005 then would decline by about
70 in 2005 and remain flat to the end of the claims period average claims
costs were assumed to continue to decline at the rate experienced during the
last twelve months

while management believes that the assumptions used in developing these outcomes
represent the most probable scenario factors which could cause actual results
to vary from these assumptions include 1 area specific assumptions as to
growth in claims rates could be incorrect 2 locations where previously there
had been little or no claims could emerge as significant geographic locations
and 3 the cost per claim could vary materially from that projected

the first consultant provided two statistical outcomes with the higher outcome
indicating a required provision of approximately 430 million the second
consultant provided a range of possible outcomes with the most probable outcome
indicating a required provision of approximately 475 million the estimate
ranged from a low a 95 probability that future charges would exceed this
amount of 338 million to a high 5 probability that future charges would
exceed this amount of 635 million using these projections management
determined that a provision of 450 million should be recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2002 as an estimate of the most probable outcome based on the
consultants projections

during 2003 claims filed and average costs per claim were in line with 2002
projections and no adjustments of reserve balances were required

reserve balances

at december 31 2003 net reserves for these matters totaled 387 million
including 261 million for the hardboard lawsuit 117 million for the omniwood
lawsuit and 9 million for the woodruf lawsuit

inspected and not paid 28 million for hardboard siding 4 million for
omniwood and 1 million for woodruf and 13 million of costs associated with
claims in process and not yet inspected 10 million for

insurance matters

in november 1995 international paper and masonite commenced a lawsuit in the
superior court of the state of california against certain of their insurance
carriers the indemnification lawsuit because of their refusal to indemnify
international paper and masonite for among other things the settlement
relating to the hardboard lawsuit and the refusal of one insurer employers
insurance of wausau to provide a defense of that lawsuit during the fall of
2001 a trial of masonites claim that wausau breached its duty to defend the
breach of duty lawsuit was conducted in a state court in california the jury
found that wausau had breached its duty to defend masonite and awarded masonite
13 million for its expense to defend the hardboard lawsuit an additional 12
million in attorneys fees and interest for masonites expense to prosecute the
breach of duty lawsuit based on a finding that wausau had acted in bad faith in
refusing to defend the hardboard lawsuit and an additional 68 million in
punitive damages in a posttrial proceeding the court awarded an additional 2
million in attorneys fees which masonite had incurred in the trial of the
breach of duty lawsuit as of july 31 2003 all posttrial motions brought by
wausau seeking to upset the jury verdict have been denied but the court has not
yet entered a judgment masonite has agreed to pay amounts equal to the proceeds
of its bad faith and punitive damage award to international paper and has
assigned its breach of contract claim against wausau to international paper

because of the uncertainties inherent in the breach of duty lawsuit including
the outcome of any appeal that wausau may take international paper is unable to
estimate the amount that may ultimately be recovered in connection with the
breach of duty lawsuit

the trial of the indemnification lawsuit against 22 insurers the defendants
began in april 2003 to recover 470 million paid to claimants pursuant to the
settlement of the hardboard lawsuit through may 2003 in july 2003 the jury
determined that 383 million of international papers payments to settle these
claims are covered by its insurance policies the phase i verdict the next
phase of the case will determine how much of the 383 million can be allocated
to the policies of the defendants the company anticipates that before a
judgment is entered the california court will also make a determination about
indemnification for future claims based on the phase i verdict the court will
also determine whether amounts paid and to be paid to the plaintiff class
counsel pursuant to the settlement of the hardboard lawsuit and administrative
expenses that have been and will be incurred in connection with that settlement
are covered by insurance the company is presently engaged in courtordered
mediation with several of the defendants

as noted above no judgment has yet been entered on the verdicts in either the
breach of duty lawsuit or the indemnification lawsuit it is difficult to
predict when the judgment will be entered this judgment will be subject to
appeal when entered because of the uncertainties inherent in the litigation
including the outcome of any appeal international paper is unable to estimate
the amount that it ultimately may recover against its insurance carriers

in addition to the foregoing proceedings the company intends to seek
indemnification from other insurance carriers in arbitration proceedings as
required by the policies

as of december 31 2003 international paper had received an aggregate of 94
million in settlement payments from certain of its insurance carriers which had
been named as defendants in the indemnification lawsuit and received the
payment of an additional 10 million in january 2004 from one of the settling
insurers

under an alternative risktransfer agreement international paper contracted
with a third party for payment in an amount up to 100 million for certain costs
relating to the hardboard lawsuit if payments by international paper with
respect thereto exceeded a specified retention that was indexed to account for
inflation over a several year period the agreement with the third party is in
excess of liability insurance recoveries obtained by international paper which
are the subject of the separate litigation referred to above accordingly
international paper believes that the obligation of the third party with respect
to this agreement does not constitute other valid and collectible insurance
that would either eliminate or otherwise affect the companys right to collect
insurance coverage available to it and masonite under the insurance policies
which are the subject of this separate litigation at december 31 2001
international paper had received the 100 million from the third party

a dispute between international paper and the third party concerning a number
of issues including the relationship of the contract funding obligation to
insurance proceeds recovered in the indemnification lawsuit was the subject of
an arbitration commenced in 2002 by the third party in london england and
scheduled to begin february 9 2004 before the hearing started the parties
settled the dispute under the settlement international paper has agreed to pay
the third party a portion of insurance proceeds recovered by international paper
under its insurance policies beginning on january 1 2004 and thereafter up to
a maximum of 95 million the precise amount that international paper will pay
to the third party under the settlement will depend upon and will be in
proportion to the amount of insurance recoveries received by international
paper in the future

while international paper believes that the reserve balances established for
these matters are adequate and that additional amounts will be recovered from
its insurance carriers in the future relating to these claims international
paper is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges if
any that may be required for these matters in the future

antitrust matters

on may 14 1999 and may 18 1999 two lawsuits were filed in federal court in
the eastern district of pennsylvania against international paper the former
union camp corporation acquired by international paper in 1999 and other
manufacturers of linerboard the defendants these suits allege that the
defendants conspired to fix prices for corrugated sheets and containers during
the period october 1 1993 through november 30 1995 these lawsuits which
seek injunctive relief as well as treble damages and other costs associated with
the litigation were consolidated and on september 4 2001 certified as a
class action on september 22 2003 international paper along with
weyerhaeuser co and georgiapacific corp agreed with the class plaintiffs to
settle the litigation for an aggregate amount of 68 million the settlement of
which international papers and union camps shares totaled 244 million was
approved by the court in an order entered on december 10 2003

twelve optout complaints most with multiple plaintiffs have been filed in
various federal district courts around the country one optout plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed its complaint on october 10 2003 all of the remaining
federal optout cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the
federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania discovery in the federal
optout cases is scheduled to conclude september 30 2004 additionally one
optout case has been filed in state court in kansas defendants removed the
matter to federal court but the federal court in wichita remanded it on
december 19 2003 the defendants have sought further review of the remand
decision

in 2000 purchasers of highpressure laminates filed a number of purported class
actions under the federal antitrust laws alleging that international papers
nevamar division which was part of the decorative products division
participated in a pricefixing conspiracy with competitors between january 1
1994 and june 30 2000 these lawsuits seek injunctive relief as well as treble
damages and other costs associated with the litigation these cases have been
consolidated in federal district court in new york in 2000 and 2001 indirect
purchasers of highpressure laminates also filed similar purported class action
cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in arizona
california florida maine michigan minnesota new mexico new york north
carolina north dakota south dakota tennessee west virginia wisconsin and
the district of columbia the case in new york state court and one of the two
michigan cases have been dismissed while all of the other state cases have been
stayed on june 17 2003 the federal district court certified the consolidated
federal cases as a class action thirtyone plaintiffs have opted not to
participate in the class litigation discovery in the federal case regarding
liability is complete and dispositive motions are scheduled for hearing on
april 23 2004 in the third quarter of 2002 international paper completed the
sale of the decorative products operations but retained any liability for these
cases

summary

international paper is also involved in various other inquiries administrative
proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property
environmental protection tax antitrust personal injury and other matters
some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or
litigation has the element of uncertainty international paper believes that the
outcome of any of the other lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened
or all of them combined including the preceding antitrust matters will not
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results
of operations

standard  poors announced that it had changed the outlook on international
papers longterm credit rating from bbbstable to bbbnegative standard 
poors also downgraded the shortterm credit rating of international paper from

note 13 derivatives and hedging activities

international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial
instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and currency risks
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities international paper at inception formally
designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying
exposure as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
each hedge transaction because of the high degree of effectiveness between the
hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the
value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value
or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged derivatives are recorded
in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value determined using available
market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies in other
current or noncurrent assets or liabilities the earnings impact resulting from
the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same
line item in the consolidated statement of earnings as the underlying exposure
being hedged the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions
are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are
effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the
related underlying exposures the ineffective portion of a financial
instruments change in fair value if any would be recognized currently in
earnings together with the changes in fair value of derivatives not designated
as hedges

interest rate risk

interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with
international papers debt some of these instruments qualify for hedge
accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 and others do not interest rate swap
agreements with a total notional amount at december 31 2003 of approximately
800 million and maturities ranging from one to 21 years do not qualify as
hedges under sfas no 133 and consequently were recorded at fair value on the
transition date by a pretax charge of approximately 20 million to earnings
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 the change in fair value
of the swaps was immaterial

the remainder of international papers interest rate swap agreements qualify as
fully effective fair value hedges under sfas no 133 at december 31 2003 and
2002 outstanding notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges
amounted to approximately 21 billion and 19 billion respectively the fair
values of these swaps were net assets of approximately 91 million and 141
million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

in november 2002 interest rate swaps with a notional value of 550 million were
terminated in connection with the early retirement of international papers 12
billion notes due in july 2003 the resulting gain of approximately 6 million
is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated
statement of earnings see note 6

during 2002 international paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates
on an anticipated 115 billion issuance of debt upon issuance of the debt in
the fourth quarter of 2002 these agreements generated a pretax loss of 28
million that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci this
amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through
october 30 2012 yielding an effective interest rate of 594

commodity risk

to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of
commodities international paper currently uses swap and option contracts to
manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices such cash
flow hedges with maturities of 12 months or less are accounted for by deferring
the aftertax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in
oci on the date a contract matures the gain or loss is reclassified into cost
of products sold


                                       64

concurrently with the recognition of the commodity purchased for the years
ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 international paper reclassified from
oci aftertax gains of 24 million and aftertax losses of 10 million and 48
million respectively this amount represents the aftertax cash settlements on
the maturing energy hedge contracts unrealized aftertax gains of 12 million
and 24 million and aftertax losses of 69 million were recorded to oci during
the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively aftertax gains
of approximately 3 million as of december 31 2003 are expected to be
reclassified into earnings in 2004

foreign currency risk

international papers policy has been to hedge certain investments in foreign
operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operations
functional currency or by entering into longterm crosscurrency and interest
rate swaps or shortterm foreign exchange contracts these financial
instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange
rates gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments
which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the
foreign operations net assets hedged are recorded as translation adjustments
in oci upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments the accumulated
gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments together with
the translation gains and losses on the net assets are included in earnings
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 net losses included in the
cumulative translation adjustment on derivative and debt instruments hedging
foreign net investments amounted to 89 million 46 million and 23 million
after taxes and minority interest respectively

longterm crosscurrency and interest rate swaps and shortterm currency swaps
are used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates
which will affect the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency
these hedges existing as of december 31 2003 totaling a net fair value
liability of 150 million have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas
no 133 the impact on earnings from changes in the derivative values is
substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign
currency debt each period

foreign exchange contracts including forward swap and purchase option
contracts are also used to hedge certain transactions primarily trade receipts
and payments denominated in foreign currencies to manage volatility associated
with these transactions and to protect international paper from currency
fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement these contracts
most of which have been designated as cash flow hedges had maturities of four
years or less as of december 31 2003 for the years ended december 31 2003
2002 and 2001 net unrealized gains totaling 53 million 49 million and 2
million after taxes and minority interest respectively were recorded to oci
gains losses after taxes and minority interest of 41 million 14 million and
2 million were reclassified to earnings for the years ended december 31
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as of december 31 2003 gains of 26 million
after taxes and minority interest are expected to be reclassified to earnings in
2004 other contracts are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the
variability in exchange rates on certain shortterm monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and are not designated as
hedges changes in the fair value of these instruments recognized currently in
earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities were
not significant

international paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes the counterparties to swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
consist of a number of major international financial institutionsinternational
paper continually monitors its positions with and the credit quality of these
financial institutions and does not expect nonperformance by the counterparties

note 14  capital stock

the authorized capital stock at both december 31 2003 and 2002 consisted of
990850000 shares of common stock 1 par value 400000 shares of cumulative
4 preferred stock without par value stated value 100 per share and
8750000 shares of serial preferred stock 1 par value the serial preferred
stock is issuable in one or more series by the board of directors without
further shareholder action

note 15  retirement plans

international paper maintains pension plans that provide retirement benefits to
substantially all employees employees generally are eligible to participate in
the plans upon completion of one year of service and attainment of age 21

the plans provide defined benefits based on years of credited service and either
final average earnings salaried employees hourly job rates or specified
benefit rates hourly and union employees

us defined benefit plans

international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its
actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by
the employee retirement income security act erisa international paper made no

2004 to the qualified defined benefit plan the nonqualified plan is only funded
to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be 46 million in 2004

net periodic pension expense income

service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans
benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year interest cost
represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation which is a
discounted amount due to the passage of time the expected return on plan
assets reflects the computed amount of current year earnings from the investment
of plan assets using an estimated longterm rate of return

     benefit charges relating to divestitures and restructurings that were
     recorded in restructuring and other charges and net gains losses on sales
     and impairments of businesses held for sale in the consolidated statement
     of earnings

the change in 2003 to net pension expense from income in 2002 was principally
due to a reduction in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and
an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses with smaller
impacts from reductions in the discount rate and the assumed rate of future
compensation increase the decrease in 2002 us pension income was principally
due to reductions in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and
reductions in the assumed discount rate and in the assumed rate of future
compensation increase

international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december
31 the measurement date and considers changes in these longterm factors based
upon market conditions and the requirements of sfas no 87 employers
accounting for pensions these assumptions are used to calculate benefit
obligations as of december 31 of the current year and pension expense to be
recorded in the following year

weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense income for
2003 2002 and 2001 were as follows




                                                            2003   2002    2001

weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of
december 31 2003 and 2002 were as follows




                                                                    2003   2002

rate of compensation increase                                       325  375


the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates
of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment
portfolio projected rates of return are developed through an assetliability
study in which projected returns for each of the plans asset classes are
determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of
returns and volatility of the various asset classes based on the target asset
allocation for each asset class the overall expected rate of return for the
portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management
and expenses paid from plan assets the discount rate assumption is determined
based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds
moodys aa corporate bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected
future plan cash flows to calculate pension expense for 2004 the company will
use an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 875 a discount
rate of 600 and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 325 the company
estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 106 million
for its us defined benefit plans in 2004 principally reflecting the increased
amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a decrease in the assumed
discount rate to 600 in 2004 from 650 in 2003

the following illustrates the effect on pension expense for 2004 of a 25 basis

minimum pension liability adjustment

at december 31 2002 international papers qualified defined benefit pension
plan had a prepaid benefit cost of approximately 17 billion at the same date
the market value of the plan assets was less than the accumulated benefit
obligation abo for this plan in accordance with the requirements of sfas no
87 the prepaid asset was reversed and an additional minimum liability of 2677
million was established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan asset
below the abo plus the prepaid benefit cost this resulted in an aftertax
direct charge to accumulated other comprehensive income oci of 15 billion
with no impact on earnings earnings per share or cash this reduction to
shareholders equity had no adverse affect on international papers debt
covenants

at december 31 2003 a strong actual return on plan assets in the 2003 fourth
quarter increased the market value of plan assets by more than the increase in
the abo resulting in a reduction since december 31 2002 in the required
additional minimum pension liability as a result at december 31 2003
aftertax oci was recognized in the amount of 163 million

international paper also incurred adjustments to the nonqualified plan
additional minimum liabilities and recorded charges to oci of 13 million and 3
million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

unrecognized actuarial losses

sfas no 87 provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses
including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit
obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the
actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these
net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that
approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected
to receive benefits under the plans approximately 15 years to the extent that
they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years unrecognized
actuarial losses in the table below decreased during 2003 to approximately 26
billion from approximately 29 billion in 2002 due principally to the actual
return on plan assets exceeding the expected return in 2003 while actual future
amortization charges will be affected by future gainslosses amortization of
cumulative unrecognized losses as of december 31 2003 is expected to increase
pension expense by approximately 30 million in 2004 20 million in 2005 and
10 million in 2006

international paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance
benefits covering a majority of us salaried and certain hourly employees
employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of

prefund these benefits and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these
plans in the future

on december 8 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and
modernization act of 2003 was signed into law this act introduces a
prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit
that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the measures of the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement
benefit cost presented below do not reflect the effects of the act on our plan
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is
pending and that guidance when issued could require international paper to
change previously reported information

international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december
31 the measurement date and considers changes in these longterm factors based
upon market conditions and the requirements of sfas no 106 employers
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions

the weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost for the years ended
december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 were as follows

a 1 increase in this annual trend rate would have increased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2003 by 65 million a 1
decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2003 by 60 million the
effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease would
be approximately 4 million

note 17 incentive plans

international paper currently has a longterm incentive compensation plan
lticp that includes a stock option program a restricted performance share
program and a continuity award program administered by a committee of
nonemployee members of the board of directors committee who are not eligible
for awards also stock appreciation rights sars have been awarded to
employees of a nonus subsidiary with 9710 and 17745 issued and outstanding
at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively we also have other
performancebased restricted shareunit programs available to senior executives
and directors

international paper applies the provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting
for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and the disclosure
provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation in
accounting for our plans

stock option program

international paper accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method
under apb opinion no 25 under this method compensation expense is recorded
over the related service period when the market price exceeds the option price
at the measurement date which is the grant date for international papers
options no compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an
exercise price equal to the market price of international paper stock on the
grant date

during each reporting period fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by
assuming that inthemoney options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are
used to repurchase


                                       70

shares in the marketplace when options are actually exercised option proceeds
are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of
earnings per common share with no effect on reported earnings equity is also
increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax
return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns

under the current program officers and certain other employees may be granted
options to purchase international paper common stock the option price is the
market price of the stock on the close of business on the day prior to the date
of grant during 2001 the program was changed so that options must be vested
before they can be exercised upon exercise of an option a replacement option
may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the
market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration
date of the original option beginning in 2004 all senior executives and
certain other officers will no longer receive stock option awards instead the
board of directors approved performance share awards for these affected
participants in 2004

for pro forma disclosure purposes the fair market value of each option grant
has been estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

directly associated with manufacturing products materials labor and
manufacturing overhead in the united states costs of raw materials and
finished pulp and paper products are generally determined using the lastin
firstout method other inventories are valued using the firstin firstout or
average cost methods

plants properties and equipment

plants properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation expenditures for betterments are capitalized whereas normal
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred for financial reporting
purposes the unitsofproduction method of depreciation is used for major pulp
and paper mills and certain wood products facilities and the straightline

costs to estimated current volume cost of timber harvested coth is included
in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of earnings

effective january 1 2002 international paper prospectively changed its method
of accounting for midrotation fertilization expenditures to include such
expenditures in the capitalized cost of timberlands accordingly these costs
have been subsequently included as part of the cost of timber harvested as trees
are sold prior to this change these expenditures were capitalized and
amortized to expense over a fiveyear period the change was made to better
match the total costs of fiber to the related income when the trees are sold
this accounting change had no effect on earnings for the year ended december 31
2002 and the effects in future years will not be significant due to the
cumulative nature of the coth computation calculation of the cumulative effect
of the accounting change on prior periods of including these costs as part of
coth and disclosure of pro forma amounts for prior years are not determinable
at december 31 2001 the companys consolidated balance sheet included 50
million of previously capitalized midrotation fertilization costs that will
continue to be amortized to expense through 2006

goodwill

prior to 2002goodwill was amortized over its estimated period of benefit on a
straightline basis not to exceed 40 years effective january 1 2002
international paper adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas
no 142 eliminating the periodic charge to earnings for goodwill amortization
for 2002 and future years in addition as required by sfas no 142 an initial
assessment of recorded goodwill for possible impairment was conducted as of
january 1 2002 annual testing for possible goodwill impairment will be
performed in the third quarter of each year see note 4 for additional
disclosures related to sfas no 142

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or
changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may
not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the
estimated future cash flows generated by their use impaired assets are recorded
at fair market value determined principally using discounted future cash flows

income taxes

international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax
assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate
changes are enacted

stockbased compensation

stock options and other stockbased compensation awards are accounted for using
the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion
apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related
interpretations see note 18 for required pro forma and additional disclosures
relating to these awards

environmental remediation costs

costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when
such costs are probable and reasonably estimable such accruals are adjusted as
further information develops or circumstances change costs of future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their
present value when the expected cash flows are reliably determinable

translation of financial statements

balance sheets of international operations are translated into us dollars at
yearend exchange rates while statements of earnings are translated at average
rates adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included
as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss oci see note 14 related to derivatives and hedging activities

reclassifications

certain reclassifications have been made to prioryear amounts to conform with
the current year presentation

note 2 earnings per common share

earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative
effect of accounting changes are computed by dividing earnings loss before
extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding earnings loss per common share
before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming
dilution were computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities
including inthemoney stock options were converted into common shares at the
beginning of each year a reconciliation of the amounts included in the
computation of earnings loss per common share before extraordinary

note 4 recent accounting developments

costs associated with exit or disposal activities

in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities the
statement changes the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs
including restructuring charges and is effective for any such activities
initiated after december 31 2002 it requires that a liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity such as onetime termination
benefits be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date
of a companys commitment to an exit plan it has no effect on charges recorded
for exit activities begun prior to december 31 2002 this standard which
international paper will adopt in 2003 will not have a material effect on the
companys consolidated financial position or results of operations

impairment and disposal of longlived assets

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets it establishes a single accounting model for the
impairment of longlived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale
or abandonment and broadens the definition of discontinued operations
international paper adopted sfas no 144 in 2002 with no significant change in
the accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets

asset retirement obligations

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations which is effective in 2003 it requires the recording of an asset
and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated
with the retirement of longlived assets where a legal or contractual obligation
exists the asset is required to be depreciated over the life of the related
equipment or facility and the liability accreted each year based on a present
value interest rate this standard which international paper will adopt in
2003 will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial
position or results of operations

goodwill

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets it changed the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill
amortization beginning in 2002 it also requires at least an annual assessment
of recorded goodwill for impairment the initial test for impairment had to be
completed by december 31 2002 with any impairment charge recorded as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change to be retroactively reflected in the
first

quarter of 2002 any subsequent impairment charges would be recorded in
operating results

the initial test compared the fair value of each of international papers
business reporting units having recorded goodwill balances with the business
units carrying amount fair value was determined using discounted projected
future operating cash flows for all business reporting units except chh where
the average quoted market price for chh shares was used where the carrying
amount exceeded fair value additional testing was performed for possible
goodwill impairment the fair value for these business reporting units was then
allocated to individual assets and liabilities using a depreciated replacement
cost approach for fixed assets and outside appraised values for intangible
assets any excess of fair value over the allocated amounts was equal to the
implied fair value of goodwill where this implied goodwill value was less than
the goodwill book value an impairment charge was recorded

based on testing completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 a transitional
goodwill impairment loss was recorded for the industrial and consumer packaging
chh and printing papers business segments totaling 12 billion this charge had
no impact on cash flow

goodwill arising from major acquisitions that involve multiple business segments
is classified as a corporate asset for segment reporting purposes while
goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of
the applicable segment for goodwill impairment testing all goodwill was
allocated to business segments the following table presents changes in the
goodwill balances as allocated to each business segment for the year ended
december 31 2002

derivatives and hedging

on january 1 2001 international paper adopted sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas nos 137 and
138 the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 133 was a 25 million charge to
net earnings before taxes and minority interest 16 million after taxes and
minority interest and a net decrease of 9 million after taxes in oci the
charge to net earnings primarily resulted from recording the fair value of
certain interest rate swaps which do not qualify under the new rules for hedge
accounting treatment the decrease in oci primarily resulted from adjusting the
foreign currency contracts used as hedges of net investments in foreign
operations to fair value

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of january 1 2002 was 171
million the net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
december 31 2002 was a decrease of 2 million

during the fourth quarter of 2002 international paper completed a review of its
deferred income tax accounts including the effects of state tax credits and the
taxability of the companys operations in various state taxing jurisdictions as
a result of this review the company recorded a decrease of approximately 46
million in the income tax provision in the 2002 fourth quarter reflecting the
effect of the estimated state income tax effective rate applied to these
deferred tax items

international paper entered into an agreement in 2000 to guarantee for a fee
an unsecured contractual credit agreement of an unrelated third party customer
the guarantee which expires in 2008 was made in exchange for a tenyear
contract as the exclusive paper supplier to the customer both the loan to the
customer and the guarantee are unsecured international paper would be required
to perform under the guarantee upon default on the loan by the unrelated third
party the maximum amount of potential future payments is 110 million in
principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest there is no liability recorded
on international papers books for the guarantee

in connection with sales of businesses property equipment forestlands and
other assets international paper commonly makes representations and warranties
relating to such businesses or assets and may enter into standard commercial
indemnification arrangements with respect to tax and environmental liabilities
and other matters where any liabilities for such matters are probable and
subject to reasonable estimation accrued liabilities are recorded at the time
of sale as a cost of the transaction international paper believes that possible
future unrecorded liabilities for these matters if any would not have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations

exterior siding and roofing litigation

three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing
products manufactured by masonite that were filed against international paper
have been settled in recent years

the first suit entitled judy naef v masonite and international paper was
filed in december 1994 hardboard lawsuit the plaintiffs alleged that
hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails prematurely allowing moisture
intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding the
class consisted of all


                                       50

us property owners having masonite hardboard siding installed on and
incorporated into buildings between january 1 1980 and january 15 1998 the
court granted final approval of the settlement on january 15 1998 the
settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting the
settlement requirements on a claimsmade basis which requires a class member to
individually submit proof of damage to or caused by masonite product proof of
square footage involved and proofs of various other matters in order to qualify
for payment with respect to a claim it also provides for the payment of
attorneys fees equaling 15 of the settlement amounts paid to class members
with a nonrefundable advance of 475 million plus 25 million in costs for
siding that was installed between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 claims
must be made by january 15 2005 and for siding installed between january 1
1990 through january 15 1998 claims must be made by january 15 2008

the second suit entitled cosby et al v masonite corporation et al was
filed in 1997 omniwood lawsuit the plaintiffs made allegations with regard to
omniwood siding manufactured by masonite which were similar to those alleged in
the hardboard lawsuit the class consisted of all us property owners having
omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january 1
1992 to january 6 1999 the settlement relating to the omniwood lawsuit
provides that qualified claims must be made by january 6 2009 for omniwood
siding that was installed between january 1 1992 and january 6 1999

the third lawsuit entitled smith et al v masonite corporation et al was
filed in 1995 woodruf lawsuit the plaintiffs alleged that woodruf roofing
manufactured by masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure
underneath the roofing the class consisted of all us property owners who had
incorporated and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january 1 1980 to
january 6 1999 the settlement relating to the woodruf lawsuit provides that
for product installed between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 claims must
be made by january 6 2006 and for product installed between january 1 1990
and january 6 1999 claims must be made by january 6 2009

the court granted final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf
lawsuits on january 6 1999 the settlements provide for monetary compensation
to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claimsmade basis
which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to or
caused by masonite product proof of square footage involved and proofs of
various other matters the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys
fees equaling 13 of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a
nonrefundable advance of 17 million plus 75000 in costs for each of the two
cases

claim filing and determination

once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement
covering the claim the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a
negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreement
designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure the
compensation formula is based on 1 the average cost per square foot for
product replacement including material and labor as calculated by industry
standards in the area in which the structure is located adjusted for
inflation or 2 the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry
standards in such area adjusted for inflation persons receiving compensation
pursuant to this formula also agree to release international paper and masonite
from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question

in connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above where
there is damage the process of degradation once begun continues until repairs
are made international paper estimates that approximately 4 million structures
have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard lawsuit 300000
structures have installed products that are subject to the omniwood lawsuit and
86000 structures have installed products that are the subject of the woodruf
lawsuit masonite stopped selling the hardboard siding in may 2001 the products
involved in the woodruf lawsuit in may 1996 and the products involved in the
omniwood lawsuit in september 1996

persons who are class members under the hardboard omniwood and woodruf lawsuits
who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining
to such suits may have recourse to warranties if any in existence at the
expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements
for making claims the warranty period generally extends for 25 years following
the installation of the product in question and although the warranties vary
from product to product they generally provide for a payment of up to two times
the purchase price

additional provisions

during the third quarter of 2000 a determination was made that an additional
125 million provision was required to cover an expected shortfall in the
reserves resulting primarily from a higher than anticipated number of claims
relating to the hardboard lawsuit this increase was based on an independent
third party statistical study of future costs which analyzed trends in the
claims experience through may 30 2000 this amount was based on a statistical
outcome that assumed that the claims rate a doubles in one state for one
additional year levels off for two years and then declines by 45 per year
b remains level in another state for two years and then declines by 45 per
year and c in all other areas declines by 45 per year the statistical
model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the expected
geographic patterns of claims and assumptions related to the cost of claims
including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation average claim costs were
calculated from historical claims records taking into consideration structure
type location and source of the claim

in the third quarter of 2001 a determination was made that an additional
provision would be required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves that
had arisen since the third quarter of 2000 due to actual claims experience
exceeding projections an additional 225 million was added to the existing
reserve balance at that time this increase was based on an independent third
party statistical study of future costs which analyzed trends in the claims
experience through august 31 2001 the amount was based on a statistical
outcome that assumed that hardboard claims growth continued through mid2002
then declined by 50 per year omniwood claims growth was assumed to continue
through mid2002 decline by 50 in 2003 and thereafter increase at the rate of
10 per year woodruf claims were assumed to decline at a rate of 50 per year
unit costs per claim were assumed to hold at the 2001 level the statistical
model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the geographic
patterns of claims rates and assumptions related to the cost of claims
including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation average claim costs were
calculated from historical claims records taking into consideration structure
type location and source of the claim

during 2002 tracking of the actual versus projected number of claims filed and
average cost per claim indicated that although total claims costs were
approximately equal to projected amounts the number of claims filed was higher
than projected offsetting the effect of lower average claims payment amounts
accordingly updated projections were developed by two independent consultants
utilizing the most current claims experience data principal assumptions used in
the development of these projections were that the number of hardboard claims
filed which account for approximately 85 of all claims costs would average
slightly above current levels until january 2005 then would decline by about
70 in 2005 and remain flat average claims costs were assumed to continue to
decline at the rate experienced during the last twelve months

while management believes that the assumptions used in developing these outcomes
represent the most probable scenario factors which could cause actual results
to vary from these assumptions include 1 area specific assumptions as to
growth in claims rates could be incorrect 2 locations where previously there
had been little or no claims could emerge as significant geographic locations
and 3 the cost per claim could vary materially from that projected

the first consultant provided two statistical outcomes with the higher outcome
indicating a required provision of approximately 430 million the second
consultant provided a range of possible outcomes with the most probable outcome
indicating a required provision of approximately 475 million the estimate
ranged from a low a 95 probability that future charges would exceed this
amount of 338 million to a high a 5 probability that future charges would
exceed this amount of 635 million using these

projections management determined that a provision of 450 million should be
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 as an estimate of the most probable
outcome based on the consultants projections

reserve balances

at december 31 2002 net reserves for these matters totaled 507 million
including 357 million for the hardboard lawsuit 138 million for the omniwood
lawsuit and 12 million for the woodruf lawsuit the reserve balance for claims
relating to the hardboard lawsuit is net of 9 million of expected insurance
recoveries remaining from the initial 70 million estimate of insurance
recoveries

at december 31 2002 there were 30 million of costs associated with claims
inspected and not paid 25 million for hardboard siding 4 million for
omniwood and 1 million for woodruf and 29 million of costs associated with
claims in process and not yet inspected 24 million for claims related to the
hardboard lawsuit 4 million for claims related to the omniwood lawsuit and 1
million for claims related to the woodruf lawsuit the aggregate of the reserve
and insurance receivable at december 31 2002 amounted to 516 million as
reflected in the table in the following paragraph the estimated claims reserve
includes 457 million for unasserted claims that are probable of assertion

insurance matters

in november 1995 international paper and masonite commenced a lawsuit in the
superior court of the state of california against certain of their insurance
carriers because of their refusal to indemnify international paper and masonite
for the settlement relating to the hardboard lawsuit and the refusal of one
insurer employers insurance of wausau to provide a defense of that lawsuit
during the fall of 2001 a trial of masonites claim that wausau breached its
duty to defend was conducted in a state court in california the jury found that
wausau had breached its duty to defend masonite and awarded masonite 13 million
for its expense to defend the hardboard lawsuit an additional 12 million in
attorneys fees and interest for masonites expense to prosecute the duty to
defend its case against wausau  based on a finding that wausau had acted in bad
faith and an additional 68 million in punitive damages in a posttrial
proceeding the court awarded an additional 2 million in attorneys fees based
on the finding that wausau had acted in bad faith as of december 31 2002 all
posttrial motions brought by wausau seeking to upset the jury verdict have been
denied but no judgment has been entered by the court masonite has agreed to pay
amounts equal to the proceeds of its bad faith and punitive damage award to
international paper and has assigned its breach of contract claim against wausau
to international paper the trial court has scheduled the trial of the claims
for indemnification to begin on april 7 2003 because of the uncertainties
inherent in the litigation international paper is unable to estimate the amount
that it will recover against those insurance carriers however as of december
31 2002 international paper had received 61 million and had signed a
settlement agreement with one of its insurers that provides subject to a
contingency in the agreement for the payment to international paper of an
additional 40 million

under a financial collar arrangement international paper contracted with a
third party for payment in an amount up to 100 million for certain costs
relating to the hardboard lawsuit if payments by international paper with
respect thereto exceeded 165 million the arrangement with the third party is
in excess of insurance otherwise available to international paper which is the
subject of the separate litigation referred to above accordingly international
paper believes that the obligation of the third party with respect to this
financial collar does not constitute other valid and collectible insurance
that would either eliminate or otherwise affect its right to collect insurance
coverage available to it and masonite under the insurance policies which are
the subject of this separate litigation at december 31 2001 international
paper had received the 100 million a dispute between international paper and
the third party concerning a number of issues including the timing of
international papers obligation to repay the third party is the subject of an
arbitration commenced in 2002 by the third party in london england

summary

while international paper believes that the reserve balances established for
these matters are adequate and that additional amounts will be recovered from
its insurance carriers in the future relating to these claims international
paper is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges if
any that may be required for these matters in the future

international paper is also involved in various other inquiries administrative
proceedings and litigation relating to contracts sales of property
environmental protection tax antitrust personal injury and other matters
some of which allege substantial monetary damages while any proceeding or
litigation has the element of uncertainty international paper believes that the
outcome of any of the other lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened
or all of them combined including the preceding class action settlements will
not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations

note 14 derivatives and hedging activities

international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial
instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate commodity and currency risks
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities international paper at inception formally
designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying
exposure as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
each hedge transaction because of the high degree of effectiveness between the
hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the
value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value
or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged derivatives are recorded
in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value determined using available
market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies in other
current or noncurrent assets or liabilities the earnings impact resulting from
the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same
line item in the consolidated statement of earnings as the underlying exposure
being hedged the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions
are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are
effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the
related underlying exposures the ineffective portion of a financial
instruments change in fair value if any would be recognized currently in
earnings together with the changes in fair value of derivatives not designated
as hedges

interest rate risk

interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with
international papers debt some of these instruments qualify for hedge
accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 and others do not interest rate swap
agreements with a total notional amount of approximately 10 billion and
maturities ranging from one to 22 years do not qualify as hedges under sfas no
133 and consequently were recorded at fair value on the transition date by a
pretax charge of approximately 20 million to earnings for the year ended
december 31 2002 the change in fair value of the swaps was immaterial and is
not expected to have a material impact on earnings in the future although some
volatility in a quarter is possible due to unforeseen market conditions

the remainder of international papers interest rate swap agreements qualify as
fully effective fair value hedges under sfas no 133 at december 31 2002 and
2001 outstanding notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges
amounted to 16 billion and 15 billion respectively the fair values of
these swaps were a net asset of approximately 111 million at december 31 2002
and a net liability of 11 million at december 31 2001

in november 2002 interest rate swaps with a notional value of 550 million were
terminated in connection with the early retirement of international papers 12
billion notes due in july 2003 the resulting gain of approximately 6 million
is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated
statement of earnings see note 6

during 2002 international paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates
on an anticipated 115 billion issuance of debt upon issuance of the debt in
the fourth quarter of 2002 these agreements generated a pretax loss of 28
million that was recorded in oci this amount is being amortized to interest
expense over the term of the bonds through october 30 2012 yielding an
effective interest rate of 594

commodity risk

to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of
commodities international paper currently uses swap and option contracts to
manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices such cash
flow hedges with maturities of 12 months or less are accounted for by deferring
the aftertax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in
oci on the date a contract matures the gain or loss is reclassified into cost
of products sold concurrently with the recognition of the commodity purchased
for the year ended december 31 2002 international paper reclassified aftertax
losses of 10 million from oci this amount represents the aftertax cash
settlements on the maturing energy hedge contracts

unrealized aftertax gains of 24 million were recorded to oci during the year
ended december 31 2002 aftertax gains of 13 million as of december 31 2002
are expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2003 the net fair value of the
energy hedge contracts as of december 31 2002 is an 18 million asset

foreign currency risk

international papers policy has been to hedge certain investments in foreign
operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operations
functional currency or by entering into longterm crosscurrency and interest
rate swaps or shortterm foreign exchange contracts these financial
instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange
rates gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments
which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the
foreign operations net assets hedged are recorded as translation adjustments
in oci upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments the accumulated
gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments together with
the translation gains and losses on the net assets are included in earnings
for the year ended december 31 2002 net losses included in oci on derivative
and debt instruments hedging foreign net investments amounted to 46 million
after taxes and minority interest

longterm crosscurrency and interest rate swaps and shortterm currency swaps
are used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates
which will affect the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency
these hedges existing as of december 31 2002 totaling a net fair value
liability of 90 million have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas no
133 the impact on earnings from changes in the derivative values is
substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign
currency debt each period

foreign exchange contracts including forward swap and purchase option
contracts are also used to hedge certain transactions primarily trade receipts
and payments denominated in foreign currencies to manage volatility associated
with these transactions and to protect international paper from currency
fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement these contracts
most of which have been designated as cash flow hedges had maturities of five
years or less as of december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2002 net
unrealized gains totaling 49 million after taxes and minority interest were
recorded in oci net of 14 million income after taxes and minority interest
reclassified to earnings as of december 31 2002 gains of 19 million after
taxes and minority interest are expected to be reclassified to earnings in 2003

contracts are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in
exchange rates on certain shortterm monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in nonfunctional currencies and are not designated as hedges changes in the
fair value of these instruments recognized currently in earnings to offset the
remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities were not significant

international paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes the counterparties to swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts
consist of a number of major international financial institutions international
paper continually monitors its positions with and the credit quality of these
financial institutions and does not expect nonperformance by the counterparties

note 15 capital stock

actuarially determined costs generally equal to the minimum amounts required by
the employee retirement income security act erisa

benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year interest cost
represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation which is a
discounted amount due to the passage of time the expected return on plan
assets reflects the computed amount of current year earnings from the investment
of plan assets using an estimated longterm rate of return

the decrease in 2002 us pension income was principally due to a reduction in
the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets to 925 for 2002 from 10
for 2001 with smaller impacts from a reduction in the assumed discount rate to
725 for 2002 from 750 for 2001 and a reduction in the assumed rate of
future compensation increase to 450 in 2002 from 475 in 2001 the increase
in pension income in 2001 was primarily due to the inclusion of the return on
champion plan assets added to the plans after the acquisition date

international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
considers changes in these longterm factors based upon market conditions and
the requirements of sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions

weighted average assumptions as of december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 were as
follows

to calculate pension expense for 2003 the company will use a discount rate of
650 an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 875 and a 375
rate of compensation increase as a result of these assumption changes the
company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately 25
million for its us defined benefit plans in 2003

the following illustrates the effect on pension expense for 2003 of a 25 basis

2002 minimum pension liability adjustment

at december 31 2001 a prepaid pension cost asset of approximately 16 billion
related to international papers qualified pension plan was included in deferred
charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at
december 31 2002 the market value of plan assets was less than the accumulated
benefit obligation abo for this plan in accordance with the requirements of
sfas no 87 the prepaid asset of approximately 17 billion at december 31
2002 was written off and a net minimum liability of 992 million was
established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan assets below the
abo resulting in an aftertax direct charge to common shareholders equity of
15 billion with no impact on earnings earnings per share or cash this
reduction had no adverse affect on international papers debt covenants

unrecognized actuarial losses

sfas no 87 provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses
including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit
obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate differences between the
actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes these
net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that
approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected
to receive benefits under the plans approximately 15 years to the extent that
they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years unrecognized
actuarial losses in the table below increased during 2002 to approximately 29
billion due principally to the decline in the fair value of plan assets and
lower discount rates unless offset by the future unrecognized gains from higher
discount rates or higher than projected returns on plan assets in future years
the amortization of these unrecognized losses will increase pension expense by
approximately 30 million per year for each of the next three years

included in the following table are the changes in benefit obligation and plan
assets for 2002 and 2001 and the plans funded status and amounts recognized in
the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the benefit
obligation as of december 31 2002 increased by 692 million principally as a
result of a decrease in the discount rate used in computing the estimated
benefit obligation plan assets decreased 918 million principally as a result
of the sharp decline in the stock market during 2002 and the resulting negative
actual return on plan assets and benefits paid during 2002

note 17 postretirement benefits

international paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance
benefits covering a majority of us salaried and certain hourly employees
employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of
a specified number of years of creditable service an amendment in 1992 to one
of the plans limits the maximum annual company contribution for health care
benefits for retirees after january 1 1992 based on age at retirement and
years of service after age 50 amortization of this plan amendment which
reduced annual net postretirement benefit cost was completed in 1999
international paper does not prefund these benefits and has the right to modify
or terminate certain of these plans in the future

a  includes 40 million in 2001 for special termination benefits attributable
     to the elimination of positions in connection with a severance program
     provided to employees whose jobs were eliminated as a result of the
     champion acquisition

b  included in net gains losses on sales and impairments of businesses held
     for sale in 2002 and 2001 were curtailment gains of 1 million and 56
     million respectively related to the sales of masonite flexible packaging
     decorative products and other smaller businesses

c  included in restructuring and other charges are 12 million and 34
     million of curtailment gains related to the elimination of 396 positions in
     2002 and 4311 positions in 2001 in connection with a cost reduction
     program and facility rationalizations

d  includes 5 million in 2001 for special termination benefits attributable
     to the elimination of approximately 515 positions in connection with a
     facility rationalization program begun in 2000

future benefit costs were estimated assuming medical costs would increase at a
10 annual rate decreasing to a 5 annual growth rate ratably over the next
five years and then remaining at a 5 annual growth rate thereafter a 1
increase in this annual trend rate would have increased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2002 by 58 million a 1
decrease in the annual trend rate would have decreased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2002 by 53 million the
effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1 increase or decrease would
be approximately 4 million the weighted average discount rate used to estimate
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2002 was 650
compared with 725 at december 31 2001

in addition to the us plan certain canadian and brazilian employees are
eligible for retiree health care and life insurance costs and obligations for
these plans were not significant

note 18 incentive plans

international paper currently has a longterm incentive compensation plan
lticp that includes a stock option program a restricted performance share
program and a continuity award program administered by a committee of
nonemployee members of the board of directors committee who are not eligible
for awards also stock appreciation rights sars have been awarded to
employees of a nonus subsidiary with 17745 and 14961 issued and
outstanding at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively we also have other
performancebased restricted shareunit programs available to senior executives
and directors

international paper applies the provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting
for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and the disclosure
provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation in
accounting for our plans

stock option program

international paper accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method
under apb opinion no 25 under this method compensation expense is recorded
over the related service period when the market price exceeds the option price
at the measurement date which is the grant date for international papers
options no compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an
exercise price equal to the market price of international paper stock on the
grant date

during each reporting period fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by
assuming that inthemoney options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are
used to repurchase shares in the marketplace when options are actually
exercised option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included
in the computation of earnings per common share with no effect on reported
earnings equity is

also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its
tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns

under the current program officers and certain other employees may be granted
options to purchase international paper common stock the option price is the
market price of the stock on the close of business on the day prior to the date
of grant during 2001 the program was changed so that options must be vested
before they can be exercised upon exercise of an option a replacement option
may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the
market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration
date of the original option

for pro forma disclosure purposes the fair market value of each option grant
has been estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

the company of its research and development operations in 2000 was 92 million
including champion for the period of julydecember 88 million in 1999 and

environmental protection

    the company is subject to extensive federal and state environmental
regulation as well as similar regulations in all other jurisdictions in which it
operates our continuing objectives are to 1 control pollutants discharged
into the air water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment
2 make continual improvements in environmental performance and 3 maintain
100 compliance with applicable laws and regulations a total of 190 million
was spent in 2000 for capital projects to control environmental releases into
the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal
of waste we expect to spend approximately 136 million in 2001 for similar
capital projects including the costs to comply with the environmental
protection agencys epa cluster rule regulations amounts to be spent for
environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and
regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns taking
these uncertainties into account our preliminary estimate for additional
environmental appropriations during the period 2002 through 2003 is
approximately 307 million in total

    on april 15 1998 the epa issued final cluster rule regulations that
established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges
from pulp and paper mills to be met by 2006 the projected costs included in our
estimate related to the cluster rule regulations for the years 2001 through 2002
are 116 million projected cluster rule costs for 2003 through 2006 are in the
range of 330 million to 370 million included in these estimates are costs
associated with combustion source standards for the pulp and paper industry
which were issued by the epa on january 12 2001 the final cost depends on the
outcome of the cluster rule water regulations for pulp and paper categories
other than bleached kraft and soda regulations for these categories are not
likely to become final until late 2001 we estimate that annual operating costs
excluding depreciation will increase approximately 22 million when these
regulations are fully implemented

    additional regulatory requirements that may affect future spending include
the epas requirements for states to assess current surface water loading from
industrial and area sources this process called total maximum daily load
tmdl allocation could result in reduced allowable treated effluent discharges
from our manufacturing sites to date there have been no significant impacts due
to the tmdl process as the majority of our manufacturing sites operate at
levels significantly below allowable waste loadings

    in recent years the epa has undertaken significant air quality initiatives
associated with nitrogen oxide emissions regional haze and national ambient
air quality standards when regulatory requirements for new and changing
standards are finalized we will add any resulting future cost projections to
our expenditure forecast

    the company has been named as a potentially liable party in a number of
environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws
including the comprehensive environmental

                                       3

response compensation and liability act cercla related costs are recorded in
the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable as of
december 31 2000 these liabilities totaled approximately 170 million
completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the companys financial condition or results of operations

    the company expects the significant effort it has made in the analysis of
environmental issues and the development of environmental control technology
responses will enable it to keep costs for compliance with environmental
regulations at or below industry averages

forestlands

    the principal raw material used by international paper is wood in various
forms as of december 31 2000 the company or its subsidiaries owned or
controlled approximately 12 million acres of forestlands in the united states
15 million acres in brazil and had through licenses and forest management
agreements harvesting rights on governmentowned timberlands in canada an
additional 820000 acres of forestlands in new zealand were held through carter
holt harvey a consolidated subsidiary of international paper

    during 2000 the us forestlands supplied 16 million tons of roundwood to
the companys us facilities this amounted to the following percentages of the
roundwood requirements of its us mills and forest products facilities 15 in
its northern mills and 38 in its southern mills the balance was acquired from
other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners with only an
insignificant amount coming from public lands of the united states government
in addition in 2000 seven million tons of wood were sold to other users in
november 1994 we adopted the sustainable forestry principles developed by the
american forest and paper association in august 1994

item 3 legal proceedings

masonite litigation

    three nationwide class action lawsuits filed against international paper
have been settled in recent years

    the first suit alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails
prematurely allowing moisture intrusion that in turn causes damage to the
structure underneath the siding the class consisted of all us property owners
having masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings
between 1980 and january 15 1998 final approval of the settlement was granted
by the court on january 15 1998 the settlement provides for monetary
compensation to class members meeting the

                                       5




page

settlement requirements on a claimsmade basis it also provides for the payment
of attorneys fees equaling 15 of the settlement amounts paid to class members
with a nonrefundable advance of 475 million plus 25 million in costs

    the second suit made similar allegations with regard to omniwood siding
manufactured by masonite omniwood lawsuit the class consisted of all us
property owners having omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into
buildings from january 1 1992 to january 6 1999

    the third suit alleged that woodruf roofing manufactured by masonite is
defective and causes damage to the structure underneath the roofing woodruf
lawsuit the class consisted of all us property owners who had incorporated
and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january 1 1980 to january 6 1999

    final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits was
granted by the court on january 6 1999 the settlements provide for monetary
compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a
claimsmade basis and provide for payment of attorneys fees equaling 13 of
the settlement amounts paid to class members with a nonrefundable advance of
17 million plus 75000 in costs for each of the two cases

    reserves for these matters total 92 million at december 31 2000 net of
expected future insurance recoveries of 51 million this amount includes 25
million added to the reserve for hardboard siding claims in the fourth quarter
of 1999 some of which has now been paid to claimants and an additional 125
million added to that reserve in the third quarter of 2000 to cover an expected
shortfall resulting primarily from a higher number of hardboard siding claims
than anticipated it is reasonably possible that the higher number of hardboard
siding claims might be indicative of the need for one or more future additions
to this reserve however whether or not any future additions to this reserve
become necessary we believe that these settlements will not have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

    through december 31 2000 net settlement payments of 277 million
including the 51 million of nonrefundable advances of attorneys fees
discussed above have been made included in the nonrefundable advances of
attorneys fees is 5 million which has been paid to the attorneys for the
plaintiffs in the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits also we have received 27
million related to these matters from our insurance carriers through december
31 2000 international paper and masonite have the right to terminate each of
the settlements after seven years from the dates of final approval the
liability for these matters will be retained after the planned sale of masonite
is completed

other environmental

    in april 1999 the franklin virginia mill received a notice of violation
nov from the epa region 3 in philadelphia and an nov from the commonwealth
of virginia alleging that the mill violated the prevention of significant
deterioration psd regulations the franklin mill was owned by union camp at
that time and was one of seven paper mills in region 3 owned by different
companies that received similar notices of violation union camp merged with
international paper on april 30 1999 and international paper has entered into
negotiations with the epa and the commonwealth of virginia

    the franklin mill novs were issued in connection with the epas well
publicized psd air permit enforcement initiative against the paper industry in
1999 our paper mills in kaukauna wisconsin and augusta georgia received
requests for information from the epa regarding compliance with the psd
regulations three additional facilities received information requests in 2000
and the epas initiative may result in similar actions at other facilities

    in august 1998 the former union camp corporation informed the virginia
department of environmental quality deq of certain new source performance
standards nsps permitting discrepancies related to a power boiler at the paper
mill in franklin virginia on april 11 2000 international paper and the deq
entered into a consent order that resolved the matter for a civil penalty of
134000

    in november 1999 the wisconsin department of natural resources filed a
civil complaint alleging past exceedences of air permit limits at the former
union camp flexible packaging facility located in tomah wisconsin the matter
was settled on november 2 2000 for a civil penalty of 60000

    on december 30 1999 the company entered into a consent order with the
florida department of environmental protection relating to alleged violations of
the wastewater discharge permit at the companys pensacola florida mill the
consent order requires the company to take additional steps to control the
discharge of suspended solids nutrients and oxygenconsuming material in the
mills wastewater and to pay a civil penalty of 137730 the consent order has
not yet become effective due to the filing of administrative appeals by third
parties

    in february 2000 the town of lyman south carolina issued an
administrative order alleging past violations of a wastewater pretreatment
permit at the former union camp folding carton facility in spartanburg south
carolina while international paper has satisfied the terms of the order the
town of lyman recently indicated it may seek penalties and other surcharges that
together may exceed 100000 we are engaged in settlement discussions with the
town of lyman

    as of february 26 2001 there were no other pending judicial proceedings
brought by governmental authorities against international paper for alleged
violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations international paper
is engaged in various other proceedings that arise under applicable
environmental and safety laws or regulations including approximately 97 active
proceedings under the cercla and comparable state laws most of these
proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial
landfills that received waste from many different sources while joint and
several liability is authorized under the cercla as a practical matter
liability for cercla cleanups is allocated among the many potential responsible
parties based upon previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous
substances and upon presently available information international paper
believes that it has no or de minimis liability with respect to 18 of these
sites that liability is not likely to be significant at 51 sites and that
estimates of liability at 28 of

                                       7

these sites is likely to be significant but not material to international
papers consolidated financial position or results of operations

    on june 19 2000 before international paper completed the acquisition of
champion champion entered into a consent order with the maine department of
environmental protection that resolved allegations of past wastewater and
reporting deficiencies at champions lumber mills in milford and passadumkeag
maine the us epa and the us attorneys office in maine have since that time
commenced a grand jury investigation of the same allegations

    we are also involved in other contractual disputes administrative and legal
proceedings and investigations of various types while any litigation
proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty we believe that the
outcome of any proceeding lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened or
all of them combined will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations
