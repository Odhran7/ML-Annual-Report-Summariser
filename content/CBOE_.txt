proprietary products 

in addition to providing cash and spot markets derivative markets and data and access solutions we also offer for trading proprietary products and are a leader in the volatility space with our proprietary products these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff of the data and access solutions business and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers which are both described below in further detail our most frequently traded proprietary products include spx options and vix options and futures 

spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the us economy the spx options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of the sp 500 index’s status as a bellwether spx options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices we also offer spx weeklys options which have settlements on mondays wednesdays fridays and on the last trading day of each month and nearly 24x5 trading in spx options we believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the trading of exchangetraded volatility products with its introduction of vix futures in 2004 and vix options in 2006 the vix index as defined below although not directly tradable is based on the midpoint of realtime quotes of spx options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility the vix methodology provides the basis for the creation of vix options and futures the final settlement value of vix derivatives is determined on their expiration date through a special opening quotation “soq” of the vix index the soq calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options unless there is no opening price in which case the opening price used in the soq calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures mini vix futures and nearly 24x5 trading in vix options and futures to provide investors with additional tools to trade volatility 

proprietary indices 

we also calculate and disseminate proprietary indices that are licensed for use by third parties or are used as the basis for other proprietary products these proprietary indices are built both through our inhouse research and development staff of the data and access solutions business and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers which are both described below in further detail our proprietary indices include 

 

in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create thirdparty indices and products accordingly we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for thirdparty indices and products 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indices we license their indices including on an exclusive basis as the foundation for indices index options and other products the company also acquires interests in and agrees to work jointly with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following

competition 

the industry in which we operate is intensely competitive we believe we face competition on a number of factors including 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods including 

 

in our proprietary products we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products such as options on spy which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products such as spx options 

the multilisted options industry is extremely competitive we expect this trend to continue as of december 31 2021 we compete with 12 us options exchanges in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology most of the equity and etp options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges in addition the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multilisted options business to their exchanges which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multilisted options and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers to increase their volume traded 

our us listed equity securities and listing services and the bids trading ats compete against 12 other exchanges as of december 31 2021 and several other atss and single dealer platforms market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders including national securities exchanges and numerous offexchange venues including other atss and brokerdealers who internalize orders offexchange additionally issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products in canada our equities ats matchnow competes with several canadian exchanges and other atss in australia our exchange cboe australia competes with other australian exchanges and atss in japan our equities exchanges and atss compete with several japanese exchanges and other atss 

the market for execution and clearing services in europe became more competitive following the introduction of mifid ii and the regulation on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 6002014 “mifir” furthermore mifid ii and mifir placed more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restricted certain types of trading activity our major competitors in europe include national stock exchanges other paneuropean mtfs european clearinghouses dark pools and systematic internalizers 

the global fx market remains severely fragmented with transparent automated marketplaces such as cboe fx challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors while the global fx market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ecns the electronification of the spot and ndf fx market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone instant chats terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading furthermore electronification of the fx market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the united states the electronic spot fx market is also intensely competitive with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of december 31 2021 cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors included in those venues 

in addition our data and access solutions face competition from other securities exchanges technology companies thirdparty market data providers and information and software vendors which have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues the sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from atss and trading venues that offer similar products distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and in certain instances we work with our market participants to try to quickly reopen marketplaces we regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our backup data centers as well as an annual test with our us trading participants in canada as required by local regulations matchnow conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually and it participates in the biannual testing coordinated by iiroc in australia and japan chix asia pacific conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually in europe we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our backup data center as well as an annual test with our european trading participants we continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities

united states 

consolidated data plan order 

on may 6 2020 the sec issued an order the “consolidated data plan order” that would require us equities exchanges and finra to develop and file a new consolidated data plan the “plan” that would replace the three current us equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions such as changes to the voting structure pursuant to the consolidated data plan order we and the other us equities exchanges and finra were required to file the proposed plan for public comment before the sec takes any definitive action on such new plan the proposed plan was filed on august 11 2020 and on august 6 2021 the sec approved such plan the plan was subsequently challenged by exchanges and the courts granted a stay of the plan until a decision is made by the courts the current data plans will continue to govern our equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga may require additional resources to comply with or challenge the consolidated data plan order and the plan may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there is a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan see “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” for more information 

financial transaction taxes 

a number of federal state and local jurisdictions in the us and eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax additionally legislation has been proposed from time to time on a federal level that would introduce in the us marktomarket tax treatment for all derivatives contracts and require gains and losses be taxed at ordinary income tax rates implementation of such taxes could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our operations see “risk factors” for more information  

market data infrastructure rule 

on december 9 2020 the sec issued a market data infrastructure final rule which makes significant additions to the content available on the securities information processors “sips” and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model the implementation of the new rules could cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a 

material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there are lower sip plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data see “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” for more information

compliance 

us securities industry 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations “sros” which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec the exchanges are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” as a “national securities exchange” and are subject to oversight by the sec 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our exchange operations are subject to the sec’s oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including record keeping and the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros the exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations for example in 2013 cboe options and c2 and in 2015 edgx and edga entered into consent orders with the sec under which they were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid fines and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and the exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees to cover section 31 fees charged to the exchanges by the sec and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of section 31 fess to the sec additionally under the rules of each of our exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of the exchanges’ rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation bylaws or other governing documents of the 

sros or their parent companies the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time

generated by our exclusivelylicensed products eg spx options and products based on our proprietary vix methodology eg vix options and futures the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our spx options and vix options and futures as a result our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

the eu has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the eu mifir requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the eu to be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis to all eu trading venues and central counterparty clearinghouses for the purposes of trading and clearing as a result owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms while similar legislation to mifir has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade proprietary and licensed index products further in 2018 the eu implemented the eu benchmark regulation which regulates users data providers and calculators of benchmarks “administrators” in the eu and among other things prohibits use of benchmarks provided by administrators outside the eu in connection with eu financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an eu equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an eu member state these regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade indexbased products listed on our us exchanges as well as impact our expansion into foreign trading of our indexbased products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the us 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in developing offering and providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not limited by our exclusive license 

the value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices although we and other index owners have prevailed in legal actions seeking to challenge our rights to exclusively license indices we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 



 

any of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the securities industry is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees we may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors which could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results we also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and valueadded market data such as historical market data 

in our options segment the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multilisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multilisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products such as spy which offer some of the features of our proprietary products such as spx 

to attract market share we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or notransaction fee trading from time to time per various fee schedules across our equities exchanges these forms of promotions along with other supplemental liquidity programs may adversely affect our profitability 

further regulatory and legal developments could also impact our ability to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge and in recent years the sec has more heavily scrutinized pricing changes 

if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products our business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearingbased business if the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease 

in 2021 approximately 647 of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearingbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges cfe bids trading and matchnow notional value traded on cboe fx cboe sef cboe europe equities and derivatives cboe australia and cboe japan or clearing volumes at euroccp decreases we are likely to see a decrease in fees 

our total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason such as 

 

over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including the collins amendment to doddfrank mifid ii and mifir may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our markets 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts if the amount of our trading volume decreases the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

revenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share trading volumes or regulatory changes 

the occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive whether as a result of fee reductions fewer members subscribing to the us tape plans or other market data offerings declines in market share trading volumes or notional volumes or regulatory changes may have a direct negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results for example if our market share of us listed equities and options or cboe’s european equities trading volume were to decline our share of market data fees could also decline moreover market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the number of market data users for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise 

regulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity or our cost in providing such services in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees in recent years certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products in addition the sec and some media have scrutinized market data and market access as discussed above the implementation of the new market data infrastructure rules could cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules which may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results including if for example there are lower sip plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data see “legal proceedings” for more information 

in addition as discussed above the sec approved a consolidated data plan to replace the three equity data plans that govern the dissemination of realtime consolidated market data for nms stocks such plan is being challenged but if such consolidated data plan were to be implemented it may have a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan see “legal proceedings” for more information 

we believe cboe europe equities and derivatives currently offers market data to customers on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost as european regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our european market data revenues while mifid ii and mifir aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in europe should this fail to materialize policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering as discussed above the ec published provisions for a consolidated tape for the eu which is expected to be implemented in late 2023 or early 2024 as proposed these provisions may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example we must reduce the fees we charge for market data 

the technology upon which we rely including those of our service providers may be vulnerable to security risks cybersecurity risks insider threats unauthorized disclosure of confidential information operational disruptions and other risks and events that could harm our business 

the secure and reliable operation of our technology including our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers market participants and other thirdparties is a critical element of our operations these systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential commercially sensitive or personally identifiable information data theft corruption or destruction cyberattack ransomware supply chain attack denial of service attack malware and other security problems as well as acts of terrorism attacks by threat actors including criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors attacks in connection with geopolitical activity such as the recent escalating tensions along the russiaukraine border natural disasters human error criminal insider activity employee error power loss service provider market participant or thirdparty disruptions or security breaches and other events that are beyond our control our increased adoption of remote working initially driven by the covid19 pandemic usage of mobile and cloudbased technologies and amount of newly acquired companies and related integrations may increase our risk for a cybersecurity incident moreover given our position in the global financial services industry and as critical infrastructure we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target or an indirect casualty of such events while we have experienced in the past and we expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and events of varying degrees we are not aware of any of these threats or events having a material impact on our business financial condition or operating results to date however we cannot assure you that we will not experience future threats or events that may be material 

we currently maintain policies procedures and controls designed to reasonably protect the confidentiality integrity availability and reliability of our systems networks and information more broadly and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access these policies procedures and controls are subject to periodic monitoring auditing and evaluation practices pursuant to our enterprise risk management program which is supported by a three lines of defense approach and our other governance practices further we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our thirdparty consultants who have access to our systems which includes simulations tabletop exercises and response readiness tests independent thirdparty cybersecurity penetration assessments are also routinely performed collectively these safeguards and measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloud technologies may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents subjecting us to contractual restrictions liability and damages loss of business penalties unfavorable publicity and increased scrutiny by our regulators and materially impacting our business financial condition and operating results we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability despite our cybersecurity measures it is possible for security vulnerabilities or breaches to remain undetected for an extended period of time such harms also could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business financial condition and operating results 

additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees however we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us the roles and responsibilities of departing executive 

officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business financial condition and operating results 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers this competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the united states as a result of the covid19 pandemic which is commonly referred to as the “great resignation” as well as the growth of new asset classes such as the digital asset space during this great resignation we have faced increased challenges in retaining and attracting qualified employees if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we have historically done 

additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

the market for trade execution services clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation in particular we have seen increased competition from offexchange venues which have increased their share of trading activity see “business – competition” for more information 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can in addition our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop introduce andor market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products 

furthermore new or existing competitors may 

 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

we depend on thirdparty service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ nscc dtc cds lch euroccp our whollyowned subsidiary jscc asx clear pty ltd and six xclear securities information processors such as the cta utp securities information processor and opra regulatory and other service providers such as finra and occ the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers and various vendors of communications and networking products and services in addition we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf more specifically 

 

with respect to options all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2021 there were 97 tphs that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for approximately 615 of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2021 the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 235 of transaction and other fees collected through occ additionally the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe options c2 bzx edgx and at all of the options exchanges should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges impose additional marketmaker financial requirements or if marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity this could create a significant disruption to the options markets including ours 

we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to 

experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements such as moving clearing to another clearing agency in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if an index provider from which we have a license or a service provider with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices or indices and other values that we calculate as an index provider or if customer preferences change the revenues that are generated from the trading of proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer 

we are a party to a number of license agreements that permit us to list tradeable products related to various indices that are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges we also enter into agreements pursuant to which we act as an index provider and calculate and disseminate proprietary indices and other values we believe that demand for our products is based in part on market perception of the quality and integrity of these indices the quality and integrity of these indices are dependent on the ability of index providers including us to maintain the index maintenance includes ongoing index calculation index rebalancing and dependance on index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products obligate the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers including us are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of indices or if any of the index providers or service providers including us fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

differences in the calculations from methodologies described in published materials or incorrect calculations of spot vix index values or our other spot volatility indices including those instances that we announced on july 30 2021 or the failure to implement any planned remedial changes may result in the loss of perceived quality and integrity of our indices loss of demand for our products increased potential for investigations and enforcement proceedings increased potential for failure to perform our obligations under agreements concerning our products or in our capacity as an index provider and increased exposure to third party claims and related litigation expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the covid19 pandemic and its effects have had significant impacts on economies around the world further impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has had significant impacts on economies around the world governments public institutions and other organizations around the world have taken and may take additional or reimpose previous emergency measures to combat covid19’s spread including vaccination requirements implementation of travel bans stayathome orders border closures and closures of offices factories schools public buildings and businesses these measures may disrupt the supply chain and may interfere with the ability of our employees vendors technology equipment suppliers data and disaster recovery centers and other service providers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business in addition to uncertain expenses and impacts to our business we may incur due to covid19 as part of us providing a safe and healthy work and trading environment employees working remotely from different locations and in connection with our return to our offices we may also be subject to claims from employees or customers alleging failure to maintain safe premises and restrictions with respect to protocols relating to covid19 further changes in trading behavior impacts to trading behavior due to market disruptions additional temporary suspensions of open outcry trading temporary regulatory measures and other future developments caused by the effects of covid19 including a reoccurrence of cases and the emergence of variants could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products market data and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and could heighten many of the other risks described herein 

our operations outside of the us expose us to currency risk 

in addition to our operations in the us we have operations in the uk continental europe canada hong kong australia japan philippines and singapore we therefore have exposure to exchange rate movements between the british pound the euro the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the australian dollar the japanese yen the 

philippine peso and the singapore dollar against the us dollar significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions acts of war or terrorism changes in governmental monetary or tax policy or changes in local interest rates these exchange rate differences would affect the translation of our nonus results of operations and financial condition into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology proprietary products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index options and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks including credit liquidity market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties 

​ 

we are subject to risks related to operating our clearinghouse euroccp including the risks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and default funds these risks could subject our business to substantial losses reputational harm regulatory consequences including litigation fines and enforcement actions and the inability to operate our business including the continued development of the european derivatives buildout 

​ 

to mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant’s positions at a loss there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions no guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations in addition although such collateral is preferably held in european central banks and central securities depositories there are occasions where commercial banks are used which can expose us to risk of default by those banks in addition euroccp entered into a € 15 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by euroccp towards a financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through euroccp’s clearing system and b financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of euroccp incurred in the operation of its clearing system however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate euroccp’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due substantial amounts of the collateral and any amounts drawn under this facility may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and default fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations this facility is expected to terminate on june 30 2022 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all we cannot assure you that the mitigating measures policies safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

our business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems if our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services these consequences could result in trading outages lower trading and clearing volumes financial losses decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup plan with respect to our significant trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite having disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all following a systems failure moreover with extended trading 

hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

our markets and clearinghouse have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 

any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected 

our use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re  engineer our software which could harm our business 

our technology platform uses open source software code companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software in addition some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated we believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code however if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in or impose significant costs on our business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation various issues may give rise to reputational risk including issues relating to 



 

damage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers this in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

financial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers clearing agents and counterparties for example we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity operational failure bankruptcy or other reasons for additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations see the risk factor “our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks including credit liquidity market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties” 

in addition with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates wedbush and morgan stanley guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that wedbush or morgan stanley fails to perform additionally bids trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to boa related to clearing until the day following the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades with respect to canadian equities we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to cds which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on matchnow and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched canadian equities trades with respect to australian equities and derivatives we deliver matched trades of our customers to asx clear pty ltd and asx settlement pty ltd asx clear pty ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe australia and as such guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in australia with respect to japanese equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the jscc which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe japan and as such guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in japan 

with respect to routed us equity transactions cboe trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to wedbush and morgan stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date cboe trading uses wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of credit suisse securities usa llc as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools morgan stanley clears trades routed through the morgan stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools cboe trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution 

with respect to us listed equity and exchange traded product options cboe trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution 

our exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us moreover we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures policies safeguards and risk management procedures reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

while neither cboe fx nor cboe sef has direct counterparty risk cboe fx or cboe sef may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx and cboe sef may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot fx on the cboe fx platform or ndfs on cboe sef 

we may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service which could subject us to trading losses when our brokerdealer disposes of that position 

we offer a smartorder routing service through our brokerdealer subsidiary cboe trading which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution in connection with this service we may assume ownership of a position in securities this may occur for example when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order when this happens we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order we may be informed later however that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it in which case cboe trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of cboe trading into which such positions settle and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible which could result in our incurring trading losses 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions if we fail to manage our growth effectively our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed furthermore failure to successfully expand into new asset classes such as the digital asset space or us treasuries or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is 

highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

for example at the end of 2021 we announced the planned acquisitions of erisx an operator of a us based digital asset spot market a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearinghouse and neo a canadian securities exchange with a diverse product and services set ranging from corporate listings to cash equity trading these planned acquisitions are expected to close in the first half of 2022 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions further in 2021 we purchased chix asia pacific a holding company of alternative market operators in australia and japan and in 2020 we purchased hanweck and the assets of ft options which are providers of risk analytics market data the assets of trade alert a realtime alerts and order flow analysis service provider euroccp an operator of a european clearinghouse and matchnow an operator of an equities ats in canada at the end of 2020 we also purchased bids trading a registered brokerdealer and operator of the bids ats in the us which is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof cboe intends to maintain the bids ats as an independently managed and operated trading venue separate from and not integrated with the exchanges 

the process of integration including in new geographies and asset classes with new regulatory regimes may expose us to a number of unforeseen risks and operating difficulties including risks relating to information technology integration and security regulatory issues and employee issues and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

for additional risks related to our potential consummation of the erisx acquisition see the risk factors section entitled “risks relating to our business following consummation of erisx acquisition” below 

risks relating to legal and regulatory matters 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are registered national securities exchanges and sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm and cboe sef is a sef each registered with the cftc and subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc in addition to its other sro responsibilities bzx as a listing market also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on bzx and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with bzx’s continued listing standards the exchanges may be subject to additional responsibilities in other international jurisdictions where the exchanges may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges failure to comply with these sro and other responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on cboe’s reputation andor branding 

our european businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the uk by the fca and in the netherlands by the dnb and the afm which through the “passporting” regime provides authorization to carry on business in other member states of the eu and the eea in accordance with the applicable eu legislation and regulation to which our european business is subject matchnow is subject to regulatory oversight in canada by the iiroc and the osc cboe australia is subject to regulatory oversight in australia by the asic cboe japan is subject to regulatory oversight in japan by the jfsa and the jsda bids trading is a registered brokerdealer subject to regulatory oversight in the us by the sec and finra and is expected to be maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue separate from and not integrated with the sros the chief executive officer of bids trading is expected to lead bids trading as an independent business within cboe reporting into an independent committee of the board of directors of cboe global markets if a regulatory authority makes a finding of noncompliance conditional fines could be imposed and our licenses could be revoked any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our us markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs and members that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our tphs and members we have begun to perform 

internally more of the regulatory services that finra used to handle and now perform internally the regulatory functions that nfa previously handled on behalf of cfe 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and occ to perform under their respective rsas the ability of finra and occ to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective rsas our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our tphs and members and our oversight of the work done by finra and occ the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by as applicable sros dcms and sefs pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient our sros dcm or sef could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange dcm or sef any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our sros dcm or sef may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

in addition sros are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions in light of these responsibilities some courts have held that sros are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions there is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims there is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation and increase liability andor other legal expenses further under the commodity exchange act cfe and cboe sef may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith we also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc fca central bank of the netherlands “dnb” afm iiroc osc asic jfsa jsda other foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets products and clearinghouse in recent years the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries we have also experienced and we may also experience due to changes in administrations in the us and expansion into other asset classes such as the digital asset space or us treasuries and geographies an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business 

further congress regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading payment for order flow and other forms of remuneration and the structure of equity markets in recent years the sec continues to consider various potential market structure changes which could result in reduced trading volumes or which could negatively affect our business to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter see note 23 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information to the extent the sec adopts additional regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 

under eu and uk regulations european and uk banks and other european and uk financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a third country central counterparty “ccp” that is not recognized in the applicable jurisdiction occ our clearinghouse for us options and futures is not currently recognized as a third country ccp by the eu or the uk however the european commission has issued equivalency determinations for ccps regulated by the cftc and sec which includes occ and occ’s application for recognition as a third country ccp in the eu is pending the uk has not issued any equivalency determination with respect to us ccps and accordingly occ has not yet submitted its application for recognition in the uk but is instead operating under the uk’s temporary recognition regime as a prerequisite to ultimately achieving recognition in the eu or uk it is possible that occ could be required by the eu or uk to contribute capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing 

member default this capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of nondefaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted occ’s stockholders including cboe options could effectively be required to fund this capital if the eu or uk do not recognize occ as a third country ccp then european or uk market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european or uk market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in europe mifid ii and mifir have introduced a number of new rules including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements which apply directly to european trading venues such as our mtf and rm the impact of mifid ii and mifir is significant and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees while increasing our costs of operating in europe additionally european authorities are planning to continue to review mifid in the second half of 2021 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business 

as discussed above in 2021 the ec and esma published proposals for the review of eu market structure including provisions for a consolidated tape for the eu changes to the transparency regime for equities increased pretrade transparency for periodic auctions and posttrade flagging these proposals are expected to be implemented from the middle of 2022 to late 2023 or early 2024 as proposed these new rules may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot fx market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot fx industry the fx global code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale fx market and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve cboe fx issued a statement of commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its fx market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the fx global code amendments to the fx global code changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements may also adversely affect our spot fx business further our fx ndf business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate or plan to operate our businesses actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us or internationally and other proposals could have a material impact on our business 

in addition us and foreign legislatures and regulators could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our exchanges and markets 

any infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some potential patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry and even if we believe that such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringement if we were required to stop using 

developing or marketing certain products services or technologies our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

misconduct by our tphs members participants or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs members participants other persons who use our markets or our products other persons for whom we clear transactions our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud market or product manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market or product manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market or product manipulation by or failures of participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges or of our products which could reduce revenues 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs and members for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

bids trading’s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with bids trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the bids trading ats is otherwise deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

​ 

the us equities ats operated by bids trading is regulated as a brokerdealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange because we acquired bids trading it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that in some cases offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the bids trading ats absent sufficient separation this common ownership of an ats and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the bids trading ats to be deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges if the bids trading ats were to be deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges certain exchange regulations could be extended to the bids trading ats which could have a material adverse impact on bids trading’s business model this could reduce the bids trading ats’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the bids trading ats to us this could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the bids trading ats as a “facility” which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  

​ 

to mitigate the risk that the bids trading ats is deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of bids trading that is intended to preserve the strategic technological business and operational independence of the bids trading ats from our registered national securities exchange businesses such that the bids trading ats and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for “facility” purposes this framework is supported by highly detailed policies procedures and controls however because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ats and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities there is risk that our framework and supporting policies procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the bids trading ats from being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges in addition because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies procedures and controls there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies procedures and controls there is also risk that new legislation or regulation or changes in existing regulation or other government action relating to “facilities” of registered national securities exchanges andor the common ownership of an ats and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the bids trading ats under the current operational and governance framework including without the bids trading ats being deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges occurrence of any of the 

risks described in this paragraph could result in the bids trading ats being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges which could reduce the bids trading ats’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the bids trading ats to us and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the bids trading ats as a “facility” which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management and compliance methods are not effective our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance risk audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance risk and audit management personnel these systems and procedures may not be fully effective we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers or third parties for damages which may be substantial for example the sec has previously brought actions against exchange operators including us for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and operating results and in extreme cases our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof as the parent company for sros other markets and a clearinghouse we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws sec fca afm dnb iiroc osc asic jfsa jsda esma and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges markets and clearinghouse 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks management of legal compliance and regulatory risk among other risks requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk if our policies procedures and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that our management compliance department risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these departments or the enterprise risk program and related policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe or cboe sef the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays including because of a government shutdown or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe global markets the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets more recently a number of federal state and local jurisdictions in the us and eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax additionally the proposed modernization of derivatives tax act of 2021 would introduce in the us marktomarket tax treatment for all derivatives contracts and require gains and losses be taxed at ordinary income tax rates if such proposals were to become law they 

could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may impact derivatives trading behavior reduce trading or clearing and could make our markets less competitive and they could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our operations 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income if this occurs we may experience a higher effective tax rate 

we are subject to litigation risks and other liabilities 

many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of litigation and other liabilities although under current law we expect to be immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority we expect this immunity will only cover certain of our activities in the us and we could be exposed to liability under foreign national and local laws court decisions and rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies 

some of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax employment intellectual property antimoney laundering technology export cybersecurity foreign asset controls foreign corrupt practices employee labor and employment areas including antidiscrimination and fairpay laws and regulations liability could also result from disputes over the terms of a trade executed on one of our markets claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money claims we entered into an unauthorized transaction or claims that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction 

for example we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and note 23 “commitments contingencies and guarantees – legal proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of specific legal proceedings 

further we could incur significant expenses vigorously defending the claims mentioned above including those found to be barred due to immunity and any future claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the outcomes of existing claims and any future claims cannot be determined and an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change 

risks related to our common stock and indebtedness 

we have outstanding indebtedness which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as of december 31 2021 we had 1595 million outstanding under our term loan facility 6465 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027 4933 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030 no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no funds outstanding under the euroccp credit facility the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions further we may default on our obligations or violate the covenants in which case we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated a default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness our indebtedness may also increase future borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements we are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and 

general corporate purposes further a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to affect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

as of december 31 2021 we have investment grade credit ratings from sp global ratings a and moody’s investor service a3 ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs could increase 

if our goodwill longlived assets investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired the resulting charge to earnings may be significant 

we are required to assess investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill longlived assets intangible assets or investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe global markets depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 

 ​ 

​ 

in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

​ 

 

furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors 

furthermore the european countries where we operate regulated entities such as the uk and netherlands may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 

risks relating to our business following consummation of pending erisx acquisition 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our pending acquisition of erisx and the acquisition introduces additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model 

we expect to acquire erisx a usbased digital asset spot market a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearinghouse which we plan to rebrand as cboe digital following close this planned acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions leveraging digital asset data from erisx’s and our existing index calculation capabilities we intend to develop and distribute digital asset indices for potential use in exchange traded products and other derivative product opportunities we also plan to develop a robust market data offering based on actionable bid and offer prices from the erisx spot crypto market and ultimately intend to develop a benchmark to help erisx’s industry partners and other market participants evaluate the appropriateness of crypto execution prices and offer digital asset trading to their clients we expect to have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to develop and launch one or more of anticipated products resulting from this potential acquisition or if the development or launch of a new product is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or receive support from market participants industry partners and users to develop and launch products as planned that erisx will continue to operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment furthermore our potential investment in erisx entails numerous risks including risks relating to our ability to 

 in addition we expect that certain market participants intend to acquire minority ownership interests in cboe digital and to serve as partners in the growth of the business if these market participants do not acquire minority ownership interests or serve as partners in the growth of the business then we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investment insufficient participation from market participants in ownership and partnership may adversely affect the ability of erisx to operate as anticipated or grow which may have a material adverse effect on our business following the acquisition 

as digital assets technologies evolve once under our management erisx may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to erisx’s business will increase the complexity of its business and may place significant strain on erisx’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting 

functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business following the acquisition additionally sources of erisx revenue are dependent on digital assets and the broader blockchain ecosystem due to the highly volatile nature of the blockchain ecosystem and the prices of digital assets erisx’s operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader blockchain ecosystem 

additionally the blockchain ecosystem is highly innovative rapidly evolving and characterized by intense competition experimentation and frequent introductions of new products and services and is subject to uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory requirements we expect competition to increase in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new products or enhance existing products that may compete with erisx we have limited experience in the digital assets space and erisx has limited experience applying its digital platform to a global exchange and clearing infrastructure for digital assets the creation and operation of a global cryptocurrency spot and derivatives trading market is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that we encounter with the operation of the erisx systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could negatively impact our business and plan of operations following the acquisition 

erisx may be unsuccessful in retaining its key personnel 

the success of erisx will depend in part on the ability to retain its key employees while the acquisition is pending and following our acquisition of erisx if erisx is unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to the successful integration and future operations we and erisx could face disruptions in our respective operations loss of customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs in addition if key employees terminate their employment erisx’s business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating erisx to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause erisx’s business to suffer in addition hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience we and erisx may have difficulty finding hiring and integrating qualified employees to fill positions following the acquisition 

the characteristics of digital assets and digital asset platforms have been and may in the future continue to be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion ransomware scams and other types of cybercrime as well as other technical issues which could adversely affect erisx 

digital assets and the digital asset industry are relatively new and in many cases lightly regulated or largely unregulated digital asset platforms on which digital assets trade pose special risks as these platforms are generally new and the rules governing their activities are unsettled and their activities may be largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to theft fraud and failure than established regulated exchanges for other products 

some types of digital assets particularly cryptocurrencies have characteristics such as the speed with which transactions can be conducted the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions the irreversible nature of certain transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions that make those assets potentially susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion ransomware scams and other types of cybercrime digital asset platforms have been shut down or experienced losses of assets placed on the platform as a result of cybercrime and any such event is likely to result in the complete loss of assets placed on such a platform any governmental or regulatory action against such a digital asset trading platform may cause assets on such platform to become frozen for a substantial period of time or forfeited and could result in material opportunity costs or even in the total loss of such assets in addition banks may refuse to process or support wire transfers to or from digital asset trading platforms 

while we believe that erisx’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities we cannot ensure that we and erisx will be able to detect such illegal activity in all instances because the speed irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital asset transactions potentially makes them difficult to track fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur erisx may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct transfers for fraudulent purposes and it may be difficult or impossible for us and erisx to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances 

various other technical issues with blockchain networks have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionality exposure of certain users’ personal data theft of users’ assets and other negative consequences and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner user and development communities if any 

such risks or other risks materialize the development and growth of digital assets may be significantly affected and as a result erisx’s business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the acquisition of erisx may increase regulatory costs and risks and there can be no assurance that our or erisx’s employees or agents will not violate applicable laws and regulations 

various aspects of the business that erisx is engaging in or planning to engage in are heavily regulated erisxs futures exchange and clearinghouse are regulated by the cftc and erisxs clearinghouse is registered with the financial crimes enforcement network and is licensed as a money transmitter in many us states and territories the trading clearance and settlement of digital asset transactions may be subject to the federal securities laws and regulated by the sec if the asset is considered a security we and erisx are also subject to federal and state antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing laws and regulations 

we and erisx currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our or erisx’s employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by us or erisx including the respective employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against us or erisx under these laws could subject us or erisx to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

regulatory or other legislative changes or actions may restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects erisx’s business prospects or operations and consequently our potential investment in erisx 

regulatory or other legislative changes or actions may impact the ability of erisx to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of erisx to continue as a going concern the regulatory and legislative framework is unsettled with respect to many forms of digital assets which means that federal or state regulators or legislators may in the future curtail or prohibit the acquisition use or redemption of certain digital assets ownership of holding or trading in certain digital assets may become subject to sanction federal or state regulators or legislators may also take regulatory or legislative action that may increase the cost andor subject companies to additional regulations and laws regarding custody or facilitating the trading of digital assets 

in addition as erisx expands its business to new products and services it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators  both with respect to jurisdiction and subject matter any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us and erisx to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of its business restrict erisx’s operations and force erisx to change its business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements we and erisx currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our or erisx’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

digital asset custodial solutions and related technology including erisx’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of digital assets employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues which could cause damage to our and erisx’s reputation and brand 

the secure storage and transmission of digital assets and data over networks is a critical element of erisx’s operations threats to erisx’s storage and transmission of digital assets and data may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom erisx has granted access to its systems 

digital asset transactions may be irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a digital asset generally will not be reversible and erisx may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the digital asset could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of erisx to continue as a going concern which may have an adverse effect on our business following the acquisition 

while we and erisx maintain cybersecurity procedures and policies those procedures and policies may not be adequate to avoid the potential losses caused by security breaches and erisx may lose digital assets without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to us erisx or to any investor and the misappropriated digital assets may not easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions whether involving erisx systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of erisx and have a material adverse effect on the ability of erisx to continue as a going concern which may have an adverse effect on our business following the acquisition 

erisx’s clearinghouse operations are exposed to risks including credit liquidity market and other risks related to the potential defaults of clearing members and other counterparties 

erisx is subject to risks related to operating its clearinghouse eris clearing which is a derivatives clearing organization “dco” registered with the cftc risks associated with the operation of eris clearing include failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight risks of default by clearing members and counterparties due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and guaranty funds there is no guarantee the collateral deposited will continue to maintain its value and the use of digital assets as collateral may introduce additional volatility in value please also refer to the risk factors above for a discussion of other risks associated with the use of digital assets these risks could subject erisx to substantial losses reputational harm regulatory consequences including litigation fines and enforcement actions and the inability to operate its business

ct plan order continuation of consolidated data plans proceeding 

​ 

on may 6 2020 the sec issued an order the “consolidated data plan order” that directed the us equities exchanges and finra to submit a new national market system “nms” plan regarding consolidated equity market data the contemplated new nms plan is referred to as the “ct plan” and it will replace three equity data plans that govern the dissemination of realtime consolidated market data for nms stocks the consolidated data plan order set forth certain changes to be included in the proposed ct plan including governance structure changes related to voting rights and a deadline of august 11 2020 by which the proposed ct plan had to be filed 

​ 

on june 29 2020 the company filed a petition for review “pfr” with the court of appeals for the dc circuit court “dc circuit challenging the consolidated data plan order briefing concluded on march 12 2021 and oral argument was held on april 26 2021 on june 15 2021 the dc circuit issued an order dismissing the pfr for lack of jurisdiction holding that the consolidated data plan order was not a “final order” because the sec had not determined whether the challenged features would make it into the new ct plan 

​ 

on august 6 2021 the sec issued an order approving the ct plan that was previously filed on august 11 2020 as mandated by the consolidated data plan order and subject to public comment “ct plan order” on august 9 2021 the company filed another pfr with the dc circuit challenging the ct plan order and the prior consolidated data plan order on september 13 2021 the company filed a motion requesting that the dc circuit stay the ct plan order pending resolution of the appeal and also requesting that the dc circuit expedite the appeal on october 13 2021 the dc circuit granted the motion to stay the ct plan order and to expedite the appeal and established a briefing schedule briefing concluded in january 2022 and oral argument is scheduled for march 24 2022 

​ 

the new ct plan approved by the sec may cause the company’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge such new consolidated data plan and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there is a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan 

​ 

market data infrastructure final rule 

​ 

on december 9 2020 the sec issued a market data infrastructure final rule “final rule” which makes significant additions to the content available on the securities information processors “sips” and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model the final rule is limited to market data disseminated by the equities sips and does not apply to proprietary market data or the dissemination of options market data through opra 

​ 

on february 5 2021 the company filed a petition for review the “25 pfr” with the court of appeals for the dc circuit challenging the final order additionally on february 5 2021 the company filed a motion for stay of the final rule with the sec which the sec denied on march 24 2021 

​ 

on march 24 2021 the sec filed a motion to dismiss “mtd” with the dc circuit 1 arguing that the pfr is not ripe because the final rule had not been published in the federal register “fr” 2 suggesting if there is ambiguity that the dc circuit clarify whether publication in the fr opens the filing window and 3 suggesting that the dc circuit could hold the case in abeyance pending filing of a pfr after publication in the fr 

​ 

on april 9 2021 the final rule was published in the fr on april 13 2021 the company filed another pfr the “4 pfr”” as a protective measure in the event the dc circuit determined that the time to file a pfr does not commence until publication of the final rule in the fr 

​ 

on june 15 2021 the dc circuit entered an order granting the sec’s mtd respecting the 25 pfr this order does not affect the 413 pfr which was filed after publication of the final rule in the fr on april 9 2021 on july 9 2021 the dc circuit entered a briefing schedule which concluded in january 2022 oral argument is scheduled for march 18 2022 

​ 

the implementation of the final rule could cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our 

business financial condition and operating results if for example there are lower sip plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data the company intends to litigate the matter vigorously

general factors affecting results of operations 

in broad terms our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets investor sentiment the regulatory environment for capital markets geopolitical events tax policies central bank policies and changing technology particularly in the financial services industry we believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends including 

​ 



 

a number of significant structural political and monetary issues and the covid19 pandemic continue to confront the global economy and instability could continue resulting in an increased or subdued level of inflation market volatility supply chain constraints changes in trading volumes and greater uncertainty inflationary increases in our expenses such as compensation inflation may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we continue to closely monitor developments around covid19 and follow guidance provided by governmental and public health agencies in response to covid19 we have provided frequent communications to employees customers regulators critical vendors technology equipment suppliers data and disaster recovery centers and other service providers and instructed nonessential employees to work from home on a temporary basis implemented travel restrictions and temporarily suspended open outcry trading between march 13 2020 and june 14 2020 without any known significant disruptions to our business or control processes we expect to continue to take further actions as necessary in response to addressing covid19 our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of covid19 however the extent to which our results could be affected by covid19 largely depends on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain further changes in trading behavior additional suspensions of open outcry trading market disruptions and other future developments caused by the effects of covid19 could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products market data and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows for fiscal year 2021 and could be material during any future period impacted either directly or indirectly by this pandemic

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect elements of our capital allocation 

​ 

we expect our cash on hand at december 31 2021 and other available resources including cash generated from operations to be sufficient to continue to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future in the near term we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility will meet our cash needs to fund our operations capital expenditures interest payments on debt debt repayments any dividends and opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program we may also utilize excess cash on hand to pay down amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement see note 12 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements for further information to the extent that our cash sources are insufficient to fund our potential acquisitions we may participate in future financing transactions to obtain additional capital 

euroccp also has a €15 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement with euroccp as borrower and the company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings but not the principal amount of any borrowings the “facility” the facility is available to be drawn by euroccp towards a financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through euroccp’s clearing system and b financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of euroccp incurred in the operation of its clearing system borrowings under the facility are secured by cash eligible bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by euroccp into secured accounts as a result should the facility be drawn by euroccp it could potentially impact euroccp’s liquidity and we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate euroccp’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due additionally a default of the facility may allow lenders under certain circumstances to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the company’s other outstanding debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which may limit the company’s liquidity business and financing activities the facility is expected to terminate on june 30 2022 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our longterm cash needs will depend on many factors including an introduction of new products enhancements of current products the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions we believe our cash from operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility will meet any longterm needs unless a significant acquisition or acquisitions are identified in which case we expect that we would be able to borrow the necessary funds andor issue additional shares of our common stock to complete such acquisitions in addition we do not expect covid19 to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources including cash from operations or uses of cash or change our ability to access capital markets in the near term or the foreseeable future

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 

we have identified the estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on these estimates and other accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

description 

our acquisitions of bats cboe vest financial group inc “vest” silexx financial systems llc “silexx” livevol hanweck ft options trade alert matchnow bids holdings and chix apac resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets while our acquisition of euroccp resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350— intangibles—goodwill and other  we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present 

judgments and uncertainties 

the estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach using discounted estimated future cash flows the estimated fair values of indefinitelived intangibles used the income approach the discounted estimated future cash flow analysis requires judgments about the discount rate forecasted revenue growth rate and operating expenses that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period additionally the analysis contains uncertainty surrounding future events as such actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

​ 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

​ 

if updated estimates indicate that the fair value of goodwill or any indefinitelived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate which could result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements however due to the results of our impairment analyses in 2021 in which all reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value we do not consider our goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles to have a significant risk of impairment 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

description 

the company’s consolidated global income tax provision deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are determined through the interpretation of tax laws and assumptions of future events to calculate an expectation of future tax consequences 

judgments and uncertainties 

on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its tax estimates and judgments this evaluation is based on factors including historical experience such as the conclusions of examinations by tax authorities changes in tax laws or rates new examination activity and results of any related legal processes we use judgment in the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of unrecognized tax benefits when determining the largest amount greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  assessing the likelihood of the benefit being realized upon settlement and the calculating expected ultimate settlement amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

significant changes in these estimates or judgments may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a future period additionally it is possible that the ultimate settlement may differ from the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits currently reported if tax authorities ultimately reach a conclusion that differs from the company’s expectation we believe assumptions made regarding income taxes to be reasonable and do not believe any change in the judgments made by management would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the company  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk equity risk credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk we have implemented policies and procedures to measure manage and monitor and report risk exposures which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our operations in europe canada and asia are subject to increased currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar singapore dollar hong kong dollar euro australian dollar and japanese yen we also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies including the swiss franc norwegian kroner swedish krona danish kroner and philippine peso 

for the year ended december 31 2021 our exposure to foreigndenominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table in millions except percentages 

 

 

equity risk 

our investment in european canadian and asia pacific operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to us dollars the assets and liabilities of our european businesses are denominated in british pounds or euros the assets and liabilities of our canadian businesses are denominated in canadian dollars the assets and liabilities of our asia pacific businesses are denominated in hong kong dollars australian dollars japanese yen or philippine pesos fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of these nonus dollar statements of financial condition into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

our primary exposure to this equity risk as of december 31 2021 is presented by foreign currency in the following table in millions 

 

 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers counterparties and clearing agents these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we limit our exposure to credit risk by considering such risk when selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the us canada and europe with respect to listed equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the nscc without taking on counterparty risk for those trades nscc acts as a central counterparty on all equity transactions occurring on bzx byx edgx and edga and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades with respect to canadian equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the canadian depository for securities which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on matchnow and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched canadian equities trades the bids trading ats platform delivers matched trades to boa which delivers the matched trades to the nscc boa guarantees the trade until one day after the trade date after which time the nscc provides a guarantee 

thus bids trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event boa fails with respect to australian equities and derivatives we deliver matched trades of our customers to asx clear pty ltd and asx settlement pty ltd asx clear pty ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe australia and as such guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in australia with respect to japanese equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the japanese securities clearing corporation which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe japan and as such guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in japan 

with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms morgan stanley or wedbush morgan stanley and wedbush guarantee trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee the bids trading ats platform delivers matched trades to boa which delivers the matched trades to the nscc thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that morgan stanley or wedbush fails the bids trading ats platform is potentially exposed to counterparty credit risk on equities trades between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that boa fails we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees 

historically we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or more visible market participants could also result in marketwide credit difficulties or other market disruptions 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot fx trades occurring on our platform because cboe fx is not a counterparty to any fx transactions all transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade while cboe fx does not have direct counterparty risk cboe fx may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade fx on the cboe fx platform 

we also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our balance sheet our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets 

as a result of the acquisition of euroccp on july 1 2020 the company is exposed to further credit risk through our clearing operations euroccp holds material amounts of clearing participant collateral both cash and noncash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit risk as well as liquidity and market risks the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

• credit risk  the credit risk is predominantly in the event a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation euroccp attempts to mitigate this risk through minimum participant requirements for clearing participants and monitoring their financial health to cover potential loss to euroccp in the event of a clearing participant default collateral is required from clearing participants besides potential defaults of clearing participants the main credit risk faced by the clearinghouse is exposure to clearing participants when a trade fails to settle to help mitigate this risk a fail fee is charged to discourage late settlements this fee covers euroccp’s costs but also acts as a deterrent as required by regulation eu no 2362012 on short selling together with certain aspects of credit default swaps 

• liquidity risk  liquidity risk is the risk euroccp may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and at the right time to help mitigate this risk euroccp monitors its liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which attempt to minimize the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only shortterm investments serves to help reduce liquidity risks liquidity is mainly required for securities settlement the payment and settlement obligations generally stem from the function of euroccp as a cash equity clearinghouse shares are bought and sold by clearing participants on a trading platform or otc and netted to settle two days later during the settlement the actual payment for and delivery of the shares take place this process requires intraday liquidity if 

counterparties which receive shares against payment are unable to settle an overnight liquidity need arises the overnight liquidity is typically very short term and is usually limited to a few days 

• market risk  euroccp is also exposed to market risk in the event that a clearing participant defaults and the market prices of the securities in its open positions have moved adversely so the clearinghouse can only close out the participant’s obligations at a loss to help mitigate market risk euroccp collects collateral from clearing participants to cover for the probable loss during normal market conditions together with contributions to the clearing fund to cover losses if a default occurred during extreme but plausible market conditions adverse movements in exchange rates affecting the value of obligations and collateral are factored into the calculation of the amount of collateral to be collected 

on a regular basis we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations any such effects to date have been minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents financial investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were 3790 million and 3378 million respectively of which 1859 million and 1280 million is held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries in 2021 and 2020 respectively the remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes due to the nature of these investments we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments 

as of december 31 2021 we had 12993 million in outstanding debt of which 11399 million relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixedrate obligations the remaining amounts outstanding of 1595 million relates to the term loan agreement which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement as of december 31 2021 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 16 million assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the euroccp credit facility as these facilities bear interest at fluctuating rates as of december 31 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and no outstanding borrowings under the euroccp credit facility see note 12 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements 

liquidity risk 

we are exposed to liquidity risk under certain circumstances in relation to the crossacceleration and crossdefault provisions within the term loan agreement and the revolving credit agreement as a result of the company as guarantor entering into the euroccp credit facility a default of the facility may allow lenders to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the company’s other outstanding debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which may limit the company’s liquidity business and financing activities see note 12 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements

competitive strengths 

at cboe we are defining markets to benefit participants and drive the global marketplace forward through product innovation leading edge technology and seamless trading solutions 

 

our legacy of innovation not only includes products but also the creation or acquisition of entirely new markets or market models including the first listedoptions marketplace the first alternative venue to traditional equity markets the first paneuropean mtf and the first electronic communication network “ecn” for the institutional fx market these markets have grown to become some of the largest most relied upon in the world 

 

value proposition 

we also believe that we provide stakeholders with a strong value proposition due to the following key drivers 

 

key growth strategy initiatives 

we expect to further grow our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

 

proprietary products 

in addition to our exchanges providing a marketplace and listing venue for the trading of securities and derivatives we also calculate proprietary indices that are used as the basis for proprietary products such as our spx options and vix options and futures or licensed for use by third parties these include 

 

our most frequently traded proprietary products are spx options and vix options and futures in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create thirdparty indices and products accordingly we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for thirdparty indices and products 

these proprietary indices and products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indices we license their indices including on an exclusive basis as the foundation for indices index options and other products the company also acquires interests in and agrees to work jointly with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following 



 

spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the us economy the spx options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of the sp 500 index’s status as a bellwether spx options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices we also offer spx weeklys options which have settlements on mondays wednesdays fridays and on the last trading day of each month we believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the trading of exchangetraded volatility products with its introduction of vix futures in 2004 and vix options in 2006 the vix index although not directly tradable is based on the midpoint of realtime quotes of spx options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility the vix methodology provides the basis for the creation of vix options and futures the final settlement value of vix derivatives is determined on their expiration date through a special opening quotation “soq” of the vix index the soq calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options unless there is no opening price in which case the opening price used in the soq calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorter term 

listing 

cboe serves as a listing destination for etps in the us and europe and its markets are structured and designed for etp issuers and their investors in 2020 cboe added 114 etp listings in the us and won 36 percent of all new us etp listings there are now 511 etps globally listed on cboe from 63 different issuers we offer fully automated opening closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process

on july 1 2020 we completed our acquisition of euroccp a european central counterparty “ccp” that provides posttrade services including clearing to stock exchanges multilateral trading facilities and for overthecounter equities trades euroccp acts as a central counterparty that for its clearing participants becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer as a result it guarantees the timely performance of the obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears additionally as a critical financial market infrastructure euroccp is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight in 2020 euroccp provided ccp protection for an average of € 41 billion of cleared value on a daily basis through the process of netting in 2020 euroccp eliminated 80 or € 30 billion of the average daily cleared value leaving an average daily settlement value of € 11 billion

competition 

the industry in which we operate is intensely competitive we believe we face competition on a number of factors including 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods including 

 

in our proprietary products we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products such as options on spy which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products such as spx options 

the multilisted options industry is extremely competitive we expect this trend to continue as of december 31 2020 we compete with 12 us options exchanges in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology most of the equity and etp options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges in addition the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multilisted options business to their exchanges which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multilisted options and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers to increase their volume traded 

our us listed equity securities and listing services and the bids trading ats compete against 12 other exchanges as of december 31 2020 and several other atss and single dealer platforms market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders including national securities exchanges and numerous offexchange venues including other atss and brokerdealers who internalize orders offexchange additionally issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products in canada our equities ats matchnow competes with several canadian exchanges and other atss 

the market for execution and clearing services in europe became more competitive following the introduction of mifid ii and the regulation on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 6002014 “mifir” furthermore mifid ii and mifir placed more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restricted certain types of trading activity our major competitors in europe include national stock exchanges other paneuropean mtfs european clearinghouses dark pools and systematic internalizers 

the global fx market remains severely fragmented with transparent automated marketplaces such as cboe fx challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors while the global fx market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ecns the electronification of the spot and ndf fx market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone instant chats terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading furthermore electronification of the fx market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the united states the electronic spot fx market is also intensely competitive with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of december 31 2020 cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors included in those venues 

in addition demand for our market data faces competition from other securities exchanges technology companies thirdparty market data providers and information and software vendors who have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues the sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from atss and trading venues that offer similar products distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products

the transaction fee pilot or a successor pilot if any may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or continue to challenge the transaction fee pilot or a successor pilot and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example order flow shifts away from exchanges were to occur 

​ 

consolidated data plan order 

on may 6 2020 the sec issued a final order the “consolidated data plan order” that would require us equities exchanges and finra to develop and file a new consolidated data plan the “plan” that would replace the three current us equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions such as changes to the voting structure pursuant to the consolidated data plan order we and the other us equities exchanges and finra were required to file the proposed plan for public comment before the sec takes any definitive action on such new plan the proposed plan was filed on august 11 2020 until and if the sec approves a new plan the current data plans will continue to govern the consolidated data plan order may cause our equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the consolidated data plan order and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there is a negative impact on the market data fees our equities exchanges are able to charge see “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” for more information 

financial transaction taxes 

a number of federal state and local jurisdictions in the us and eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax implementation of a financial transaction tax could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our operations see “risk factors” for more information  

market data infrastructure rule 

on december 9 2020 the sec issued a market data infrastructure final rule which makes significant additions to the content available on the securities information processors “sips” and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model the implementation of the new rules could cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there are lower sip plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data see “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” for more information 

europe 

brexit 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom the “uk” voted to leave the eu in a referendum the “brexit vote” on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu “brexit” and began a transition period the “transition period” lasting until december 31 2020 on december 31 2020 the transition period ended the eu and uk agreed to a trade deal but it did not cover the entire financial sector new restrictions on share trading came into force when trading began on january 4 2021 preventing eu firms from accessing uk venues in european economic area “eea”listed securities however this restriction was not imposed in the other direction as a result uk firms are permitted to trade eea listed securities on eu venues while the eu and uk have committed to agreeing to a framework for cooperation on financial service regulation there is no assurance that this will lead to improved access to uk venues by eu firms there is likely to be ongoing uncertainty about the capital markets regulation that will apply to cboe europe equities and its customers for the foreseeable future for information regarding risks related to brexit see “risk factors” 

withdrawal of swiss equivalence and swiss counter measure 

as a result of an ongoing disagreement between the eu and switzerland the european commission allowed its mifid equivalence decision for switzerland to expire at the end of june 2019 as a result switzerland made it illegal for venues in the eu including cboe europe to trade swiss equities consequently cboe europe had to remove these instruments from trading and suffered a loss of trading revenues however following brexit and the end of the transition period uk and swiss governments were able to reach an agreement to allow the trading of swiss equities on uk trading venues including cboe europe’s uk exchange cboe europe resumed trading in swiss equities on february 4 2021

compliance 

us securities industry 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations “sros” which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec the exchanges are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” as a “national securities exchange” and are subject to oversight by the sec 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our exchange operations are subject to the sec’s oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including record keeping and the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros the exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations for example in 2013 cboe options and c2 and in 2015 edgx and edga entered into consent orders with the sec under which they 

were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid fines and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and the exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees to cover section 31 fees charged to the exchanges by the sec and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of section 31 fess to the sec additionally under the rules of each of our exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of the exchanges’ rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation bylaws or other governing documents of the sros or their parent companies the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

summary of risk factors 

the following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties described below that we believe are material to us at this time 

 ​ 

risks relating to our business 

the covid19 pandemic and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of covid19 however the extent to which our results could be affected by covid19 largely depends on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted governments public institutions and other organizations around the world have taken and may take additional emergency measures to combat its spread including rollouts of vaccinations implementation of travel 

bans and closures of offices factories schools public buildings and businesses these measures may interfere with the ability of our employees vendors technology equipment suppliers data and disaster recovery centers and other service providers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business in particular between march 13 2020 and june 14 2020 we temporarily suspended open outcry trading in response to covid19 in addition to uncertain expenses we may incur due to covid19 as part of us providing a safe and healthy work and trading environment employees working remotely from different locations and in connection with our eventual return to our offices we may also be subject to claims from employees or customers alleging failure to maintain safe premises and restrictions with respect to protocols relating to covid19 further changes in trading behavior impacts to trading behavior due to the temporary suspension of open outcry trading market disruptions additional temporary suspensions of open outcry trading temporary regulatory measures and other future developments caused by the effects of covid19 including a reoccurrence of cases could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products market data and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and could heighten many of the other risks described below 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indices and additionally hold exclusive rights to our proprietary vix methodology that provides the basis for the creation of vix options and futures in 2020 approximately 580 of our net transaction and clearing fees defined below were generated by futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products eg spx options and products based on our proprietary vix methodology eg vix options and futures the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our spx options and vix options and futures as a result our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

the eu has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the eu mifir requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the eu to be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis to all eu trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing as a result owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms while similar legislation to mifir has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade internally developed and licensed index products further in 2018 the eu implemented the eu benchmark regulation which regulates users data providers and calculators of benchmarks “administrators” in the eu and among other things prohibits use of benchmarks in connection with a financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an eu member state these regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade indexbased products listed on our us exchanges as well as impact our expansion activities to establish foreign trading of our indexbased products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the us 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in developing offering and providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices although we and the 

index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indices we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 

any of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the securities industry is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees we may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors which could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results we also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and valueadded market data such as historical market data 

in our options segment the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multilisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multilisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products including spy which offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

to attract market share we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or notransaction fee trading from time to time bzx also offers a “crossasset add volume tier” that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the bzx equities and options platforms similarly edgx offers a “crossasset tier” that gives a reduced fee for volume on both the edgx equities and options platforms these forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products our business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearingbased business if the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease 

in 2020 approximately 632 of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearingbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges cfe and matchnow notional value traded on cboe fx cboe sef and cboe europe equities exchanges or clearing volumes at euroccp decreases we are likely to see a decrease in fees 

our total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason such as 

 

over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including the collins amendment to doddfrank mifid ii and mifir may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts if the amount of our trading volume decreases the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

revenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share trading volumes or regulatory changes 

the occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive whether as a result of fee reductions fewer members subscribing to the us tape plans declines in market share or trading volumes or notional volume in the case of cboe europe equities or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results for example if our market share of us listed equities and options or cboe’s european equities trading were to decline our share of market data fees could also decline moreover market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise 

regulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity or our cost in providing such services in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees in recent years certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products in addition the sec and some media have scrutinized market data and market access as discussed above the implementation of the new market data infrastructure rules could cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example there are lower sip plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data see “legal proceedings” for more information 

in addition as discussed above the sec issued a final consolidated data plan order that would require us equities exchanges and finra to develop and file a new consolidated data plan if the consolidated data plan order were to be implemented it may have a negative impact on the market data fees we charge and there could be a negative impact on our revenues see “legal proceedings” for more information 

we believe cboe europe equities currently offers market data to customers on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost as european regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our european market data revenues while mifid ii and mifir aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in europe should this fail to materialize policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering 

the technology upon which we rely including those of our service providers may be vulnerable to security risks cybersecurity risks insider threats unauthorized disclosure of confidential information operational disruptions and other risks and events that could harm our business 

the secure and reliable operation of our technology including our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential commercially sensitive or personally identifiable information data theft corruption or destruction cyberattack malware and other security problems as well as acts of terrorism natural disasters human error criminal insider activity power loss and other events that are beyond our control as previously disclosed in 2018 we discovered and initiated an investigation of an internal theft of idled and deactivated computer servers and networking devices we subsequently resolved the incident by including among other actions terminating the employment of the responsible individual reporting the matter to regulators and law enforcement and improving our policies procedures and controls over the physical security and protection of our computer systems and communications networks to help minimize the risk of reoccurrence 

we currently maintain policies procedures and controls designed to protect the confidentiality integrity availability and reliability of our systems networks and information more broadly and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access these policies procedures and controls are subject to periodic monitoring auditing and evaluation practices pursuant to our enterprise risk management program further we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our thirdparty consultants who have access to our systems which includes simulations tabletop exercises and response readiness tests independent thirdparty cybersecurity penetration assessments are also routinely performed collectively these safeguards and measures may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents subjecting us to contractual restrictions liability and damages loss of business penalties unfavorable publicity and increased scrutiny by our regulators and materially impacting our financial condition and operating results we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability such harms also could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business financial condition and operating results 

additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

the market for trade execution services clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation see “business – competition” for more information 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can in addition our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop introduce andor market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products 

furthermore new or existing competitors may 

 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

we depend on thirdparty service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ nscc dtc cds lch euroccp our whollyowned subsidiary and six xclear securities information processors such as the cta utp securities information processor and opra regulatory and other service providers such as finra and occ the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers and various vendors of communications and networking products and services in addition we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf more specifically 



 

with respect to options all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2020 there were 97 tphs that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for approximately 629 of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2020 the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 180 of transaction and other fees collected through occ additionally the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe options c2 bzx edgx and at all of the options exchanges should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges impose additional marketmaker financial requirements or if marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity this could create a significant disruption to the options markets including ours 

we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements such as moving clearing to another clearing agency in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

our operations outside of the us expose us to currency risk 

in addition to our operations in the us we have operations in the uk continental europe canada ecuador hong kong and singapore we therefore have exposure to exchange rate movements between the british pound the euro the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar and the singapore dollar against the us dollar significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions acts of war or terrorism changes in governmental monetary or tax policy brexit or changes in local interest rates these exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our nonus results of operations and financial condition into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology proprietary products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index options and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of 

others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees however we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us the roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business financial condition and operating results 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we have historically done 

additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks including credit liquidity market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties 

​ 

we are subject to risks related to operating our clearinghouse euroccp including the risks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and default funds these risks could subject our business to substantial losses reputational harm regulatory consequences including litigation fines and enforcement actions and the inability to operate our business including the continued development of the european derivatives buildout 

​ 

to mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant’s positions at a loss there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions no guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations in addition although such collateral is preferably held in european central banks and central securities depositories there are occasions where commercial banks are used which can expose us to risk of default by those banks in addition euroccp entered into a € 15 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by euroccp towards a financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through euroccp’s clearing system and b financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of euroccp incurred in the operation of its clearing system however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate euroccp’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due substantial amounts of the collateral and any amounts drawn under this facility may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and default fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations this facility is expected to terminate on july 1 2021 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all we cannot assure you that the mitigating measures policies safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

our business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems if our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services these consequences could result in trading outages lower trading and clearing volumes financial losses decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup plan of significant trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite having disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all following a systems failure moreover with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

our markets and clearinghouse have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 

any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected 

our use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re  engineer our software which could harm our business 

our technology platform uses open source software code companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software in addition some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated we believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code however if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source 

code reengineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in or impose significant costs on our business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation various issues may give rise to reputational risk including issues relating to 

 

damage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers this in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

financial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers clearing agents and counterparties for example we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity operational failure bankruptcy or other reasons for additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations see the risk factor “our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks including credit liquidity market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties” 

in addition with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates wedbush and morgan stanley guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that wedbush or morgan stanley fails to perform with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades with respect to canadian equities we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to the cds which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on matchnow and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched canadian equities trades 

with respect to routed us equity transactions cboe trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to wedbush and morgan stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date cboe trading uses wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of credit suisse securities usa llc as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools morgan stanley clears trades routed through the morgan stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools cboe trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing 

brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution additionally bids trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to boa related to clearing until the day following the trade date 

with respect to us listed equity and exchange traded product options cboe trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution 

our exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us moreover we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures policies safeguards and risk management procedures reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

while neither cboe fx nor cboe sef has direct counterparty risk cboe fx or cboe sef may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx and cboe sef may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot fx on the cboe fx platform or ndfs on cboe sef 

we may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service which could subject us to trading losses when our brokerdealer disposes of that position 

we offer a smartorder routing service through our brokerdealer subsidiary cboe trading which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution in connection with this service we may assume ownership of a position in securities this may occur for example when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order when this happens we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order we may be informed later however that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it in which case cboe trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of cboe trading into which such positions settle and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible which could result in our incurring trading losses 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions if we fail to manage our growth effectively our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed furthermore failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

for example in 2020 we purchased hanweck and the assets of ft options which are providers of risk analytics market data the assets of trade alert a realtime alerts and order flow analysis service provider euroccp an operator of a european clearinghouse and matchnow an operator of an equities ats in canada at the end of 2020 we also purchased bids trading a registered brokerdealer and operator of the bids ats in the us which is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results however the ats operated by bids trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof as such cboe intends to maintain the bids ats as an independently managed and operated trading venue separate from and not integrated with the exchanges 

we may be required to inject further capital into occ or return dividends received back to occ 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges in january 2020 upon receipt of sec approval occ established a capital management policy providing that if occ’s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds occ can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members although cboe options does not have a legal or contractual obligation to contribute capital to occ under occ’s capital management policy or otherwise given occ’s importance to cboe’s businesses if occ were to experience financial difficulties cboe options might nevertheless effectively but not legally be required to inject further capital into it in order for occ to maintain sufficient working or regulatory capital in a worstcase scenario occ might have its regulatory license suspended or withdrawn or might have to wind down this may result in a loss to cboe options of its investment in occ and withdrawal of occ as a clearing house which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition while occ’s new capital management policy is now effective there remains some degree of uncertainty as to the terms and conditions of the winddown of occ’s prior capital plan under which occ’s shareholders including cboe options provided equity capital to occ and received annual dividends in respect thereof and which was disapproved by the sec on february 13 2019 depending on the terms on which the prior occ capital plan is ultimately required to be unwound cboe options could potentially be required to return dividend payments received from occ during the time the capital plan was in effect 

risks relating to legal and regulatory matters 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are registered national securities exchanges and sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm and cboe sef is a sef each registered with the cftc and subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc in addition to its other sro responsibilities bzx as a listing market also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on bzx and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with bzx’s continued listing standards failure to comply with these sro responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on cboe’s reputation andor branding 

our european businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the uk by the fca and in the netherlands by the dnb and the afm which through the “passporting” regime provides authorization to carry on business in other member 

states of the eu and the eea in accordance with the applicable eu legislation and regulation to which our european business is subject matchnow is subject to regulatory oversight in canada by the iiroc and the osc bids trading is a registered brokerdealer subject to regulatory oversight in the us by the sec and finra and is expected to be maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue separate from and not integrated with the sros bids trading chief executive officer tim mahoney is expected to remain in his current role and lead bids trading as an independent business within cboe reporting into an independent committee of the board of directors of cboe global markets if a regulatory authority makes a finding of noncompliance conditional fines could be imposed and our licenses could be revoked any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our us markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs and members that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our tphs and members we have begun to perform internally more of the regulatory services that finra used to handle and now perform internally the regulatory functions that nfa previously handled on behalf of cfe 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and occ to perform under their respective rsas the ability of finra and occ to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective rsas our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our tphs and members and our oversight of the work done by finra and occ the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by as applicable sros dcms and sefs pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient our sros dcm or sef could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange dcm or sef any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our sros dcm or sef may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

in addition sros are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions in light of these responsibilities some courts have held that sros are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions there is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims there is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation and increase liability andor other legal expenses further under the commodity exchange act cfe and cboe sef may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith we also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc fca dnb afm iiroc osc foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets and clearinghouse in recent years the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries we have also experienced and we may also experience due to the recent elections and changes in administrations in the us an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business 

starting in 2015 large us banks were required to use a calculation methodology known as the current exposure method “cem” to compute regulatory capital requirements associated with the clearing guarantee provided by bankaffiliated occ clearing members us banks as well as european banks that also apply cem are required to maintain regulatory capital that is disproportionate to the risk of clearing options contracts and has led to further increases in capital requirements for bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives in 

november 2019 the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency approved replacing cem with a more risksensitive calculation method known as the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk “saccr” which is expected to reduce capital requirements associated with the clearing of listed options banks subject to the november 2019 final rule are required to adopt saccr by january 1 2022 but have been able to do so since april 1 2020 if the implementation of saccr does not occur earlier than 2022 during that time we may experience a reduction in trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated clearing members charging their customers more to trade reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of marketmaker clearing 

further congress regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading and the structure of equity markets in recent years the sec continues to consider various potential market structure changes which could result in reduced trading volumes or which could negatively affect our business to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter see note 24 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information to the extent the sec adopts additional regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 

in addition as discussed above in december 2018 the sec approved the transaction fee pilot the transaction fee pilot or a successor may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the transaction fee pilot or a successor and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example shifts in order flow away from exchanges were to occur on june 16 2020 the court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the transaction fee pilot and remanded it back to the sec for reconsideration see “legal proceedings” for more information 

under eu regulations european banks and other european financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu however the occ is working with the eu to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent as a prerequisite to becoming qualified occ could be required by the eu to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default this capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of nondefaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted occ’s stockholders including cboe options could effectively be required to fund this capital if the eu does not recognize occ as a qualified clearinghouse by june 15 2021 or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended then european market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in europe mifid ii and mifir have introduced a number of new rules including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements which apply directly to european trading venues such as our mtf and rm the impact of mifid ii and mifir is significant and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees while increasing our costs of operating in europe additionally european authorities are planning to continue to review mifid in 2021 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business 

the legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot fx market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot fx industry the fx global code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale fx market and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve cboe fx issued a statement of commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its fx market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the fx global code changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements may also adversely affect our spot fx business further our fx ndf business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us or europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business 

in addition us and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our exchanges and markets 

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change or if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer 

we are a party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indices including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 sp 100 and sp select sectors indices djia lseg and msci these license agreements provide that we are authorized to list products based on their indices and some of the resulting index options and futures are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges we also enter into licensing agreements pursuant to which we calculate and disseminate values of proprietary indices the quality and integrity of each of these indices are dependent on the ability of the index providers including us to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers including us are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

any infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some potential patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry and even if we believe that such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringement if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products services or technologies our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

misconduct by our tphs members participants or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs members participants other persons who use our markets or our products other persons for whom we clear transactions our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud market or product manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market or product manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market or product manipulation by or failures of participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges or of our products which could reduce revenues 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs and members for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

bids trading’s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with bids trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the bids trading ats is otherwise deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected

the us equities ats operated by bids trading is regulated as a brokerdealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange because we acquired bids trading it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that in some cases offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the bids trading ats absent sufficient separation this common ownership of an ats and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the bids trading ats to be deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges if the bids trading ats were to be deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges certain exchange regulations could be extended to the bids trading ats which could have a material adverse impact on bids trading’s business model this could reduce the bids trading ats’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the bids trading ats to us this could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the bids trading ats as a “facility” which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  

​ 

to mitigate the risk that the bids trading ats is deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of bids trading that is intended to preserve the strategic technological business and operational independence of the bids trading ats from our registered national securities exchange businesses such that the bids trading ats and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for “facility” purposes this framework is supported by highly detailed policies procedures and controls however because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ats and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities there is risk that our framework and supporting policies procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the bids trading ats from being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges in addition because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies procedures and controls there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies procedures and controls there is also risk that new legislation or regulation or changes in existing regulation or other government action relating to “facilities” of registered national securities exchanges andor the common ownership of an ats and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the bids trading ats under the current operational and governance framework including without the bids trading ats being deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges occurrence of any of the risks described in this paragraph could result in the bids trading ats being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges which could reduce the bids trading ats’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the bids trading ats to us and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the bids trading ats as a “facility” which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

brexit could have a negative impact on the uk and eu economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated 

in addition to the economic uncertainty the brexit vote brexit and expiration of the transition period bring there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider 



 

once the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu new restrictions on share trading came into force when trading began on january 4 2021 preventing eu firms from accessing uk venues in eealisted securities passporting arrangements ceased to be effective as did the mutual rights of access to market infrastructure and arrangements for mutual recognition of bank recovery and resolution regimes 

now that the uk has ceased to be a member state of the eu the ability of regulated financial institutions to do business between the uk and the eu27 and the wider eea is now subject to the potential development of future separate arrangements between the uk and the eea there can be no assurance that there will be any such arrangements concluded and if they are concluded on what terms 

 

in 2020 we derived 91 of our total revenues less cost of revenues from our uk operations depending on the outcome of the future separate arrangements between the uk and the eea companies with operations in the uk may face unfavorable business conditions to access the single market in preparation for the current situation cboe europe equities established a regulated entity in the eu in addition to its existing entity in the uk so that it can continue offering its services to customers in both jurisdictions since the start of trading on january 4 2021 the services of this new entity have been used more extensively because cboe europe has seen a shift of almost all trading in eea instruments from its uk to its eu venue similarly euroccp participates in the uk temporary recognition regime for ccp’s allowing it to continue to operate in the uk as a ccp for up to three years after the uk ceases to be a member state of the eu pending permanent recognition under uk domestic law nevertheless if the eu or the uk introduce new legislation that could restrict free competition or access to capital markets the impact of such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management and compliance methods are not effective our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance risk audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance risk and audit management personnel these systems and procedures may not be fully effective we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers or third parties for damages which may be substantial for example the sec has previously brought actions against exchange operators including us for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and operating 

results and in extreme cases our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof as the parent company for sros other markets and a clearinghouse we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws sec fca afm dnb iiroc osc esma and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges markets and clearinghouse 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks management of legal compliance and regulatory risk among other risks requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk if our policies procedures and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that our management compliance department risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these departments or the enterprise risk program and related policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe or cboe sef the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays including because of a government shutdown or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe global markets the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets more recently a number of federal state and local jurisdictions in the us and eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading or clearing and could make our markets less competitive and they could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our operations 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income if this occurs we may experience a higher effective tax rate 

risks related to our common stock and indebtedness 

we have outstanding indebtedness which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as of december 31 2020 we had 687 million outstanding under our term loan facility 6459 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027 4893 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030 no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no funds outstanding under the euroccp credit facility the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions further we may 

default on our obligations or violate the covenants in which case we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated a default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness our indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements we are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes further a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to affect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

as of december 31 2020 we have investment grade credit ratings from sp global ratings a and moody’s investor service a3 ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs could increase 

if our goodwill longlived assets investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired the resulting charge to earnings may be significant 

we are required to assess investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill longlived assets intangible assets or investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe global markets depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 

 ​ 

in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

​ 

 

furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors 

furthermore the european countries where we operate regulated entities such as the uk and netherlands may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock

general factors affecting results of operations 

in broad terms our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets investor sentiment the regulatory environment for capital markets geopolitical events tax policies central bank policies and changing technology particularly in the financial services industry we believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends including 

 

a number of significant structural political and monetary issues and the covid19 pandemic continue to confront the global economy and instability could continue resulting in an increased or subdued level of market volatility changes in trading volumes and greater uncertainty 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic we are closely monitoring developments around covid19 and following guidance provided by governmental and public health agencies in response to covid19 we have provided frequent communications to employees customers regulators critical vendors technology equipment suppliers data and disaster recovery centers and other service providers and instructed nonessential employees to work from home on a temporary basis implemented travel restrictions and temporarily suspended open outcry trading between march 13 2020 and june 14 2020 without any known significant disruptions to our business or control processes we expect to continue to take further actions as necessary in response to addressing covid19 as of the date of this report it is too early to determine the full impact this virus may have on the global financial markets and the overall economy our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of covid19 however the extent to which our results could be affected by covid19 largely depends on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain further changes in trading behavior additional suspensions of open outcry trading market disruptions and other future developments caused by the effects of covid19 could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products market data and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows for fiscal year 2021 and could be material during any future period impacted either directly or indirectly by this pandemic

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect our capital allocation 

we expect our cash on hand at december 31 2020 and other available resources including cash generated from operations to be sufficient to continue to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future in the near term we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility will meet our cash needs to fund our operations capital expenditures interest payments on debt debt repayments any dividends potential strategic acquisitions and opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program we may also utilize excess cash on hand to pay down amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement see note 13 “debt” of the consolidated financial statements for further information 

on july 1 2020 in connection with the company’s acquisition of euroccp euroccp as borrower and the company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings but not the principal amount of any borrowings entered into a € 15 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement the “facility” the facility is available to be drawn by euroccp towards a financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through euroccp’s clearing system and b financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of euroccp incurred in the operation of its clearing system borrowings under the facility are secured by cash eligible government bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by euroccp into secured accounts as a result should the facility be drawn by euroccp it could potentially impact euroccp’s liquidity and we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate euroccp’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due additionally a default of the facility may allow lenders under certain circumstances to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the company’s other outstanding debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which may limit the company’s liquidity business and financing activities the facility is expected to terminate on july 1 2021 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all

guarantees 

we use wedbush and morgan stanley to clear our routed equities transactions for our us equities exchanges wedbush and morgan stanley guarantee the trade until one day after the trade date after which time the nscc provides a guarantee in the case of failure to perform on the part of one of our clearing firms wedbush or morgan stanley we provide the guarantee to the counterparty to the trade occ acts as a central counterparty on all transactions in listed equity options in our options segment and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our options transactions we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and 

accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades with respect to canadian equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the canadian depository for securities which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on matchnow and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched canadian equities trades the bids trading ats platform delivers matched trades to bofa securities inc which delivers the matched trades to the nscc 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions of bats cboe vest financial group inc “vest” silexx financial systems llc “silexx” livevol hanweck ft options trade alert matchnow and bids holdings resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets while our acquisition of euroccp resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350— intangibles—goodwill and other  we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using the october 1 carrying values goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with asc 35020 if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess if the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is less than their carrying value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2020 and determined that no impairment existed 

the estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach using discounted estimated future cash flows the estimated fair values of indefinitelived intangibles used the income approach the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgment including judgments about the d iscount rate forecasted revenue growth rate and operating expenses that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period as such actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if updated estimates indicate that the fair value o f goodwill or any indefinitelived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate 

purchase accounting 

tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense when available the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices information from comparable transactions offers made by other prospective acquirers in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness level 1 and 2 unobservable inputs such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value level 3 are used if observable inputs are not available as noted in asc 805— business combinations  the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to twelve months after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed see note 5 “acquisitions” for additional information 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in our opinion it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 

the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based upon the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement also interest and penalties expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions the company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk equity risk credit risk and interest rate risk we have implemented policies and procedures to measure manage and monitor and report risk exposures which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our operations in europe canada and asia are subject to increased currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar singapore dollar hong kong dollar and the euro we also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies including the swiss franc norwegian kroner swedish krona and danish kroner 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our exposure to foreigndenominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table 

 

 

equity risk 

our investment in european and canadian operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to us dollars the assets and liabilities of our european business are denominated in british pounds or euros the assets and liabilities of our canadian business are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of these nonus dollar statements of financial condition into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

our primary exposure to this equity risk as of december 31 2020 is presented by foreign currency in the following table 

 

 

​ 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers counterparties and clearing agents these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we limit our exposure to credit risk by considering such risk when selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the us canada and europe with respect to listed equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the national security clearing corporation “nscc” without taking on counterparty risk for those trades nscc acts as a central counterparty on all equity transactions occurring on bzx byx edgx and edga and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades with respect to canadian equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the canadian depository for securities which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on matchnow and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched canadian equities trades the bids trading ats platform delivers matched trades to bofa securities inc which delivers the matched trades to the nscc 

with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms morgan stanley or wedbush morgan stanley and wedbush guarantee trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that morgan stanley or wedbush fails we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees 

historically we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or more visible market participants could also result in marketwide credit difficulties or other market disruptions 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot fx trades occurring on our platform because cboe fx is not a counterparty to any fx transactions all transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade while cboe fx does not have direct counterparty risk cboe fx may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade fx on the cboe fx platform 

we also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our balance sheet our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets 

as a result of the acquisition of euroccp on july 1 2020 the company is exposed to further credit risk through our clearing operations euroccp holds material amounts of clearing participant collateral both cash and noncash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit risk as well as liquidity and market risks the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

• credit risk  the credit risk is predominantly in the event a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation euroccp attempts to mitigate this risk through minimum participant requirements for clearing participants and monitoring their financial health to cover potential loss to euroccp in the event of a clearing participant default collateral is required from clearing participants besides potential defaults of clearing participants the main credit risk faced by the clearinghouse is exposure to clearing participants when a trade fails to settle to help mitigate this risk a fail fee is charged to discourage late settlements this fee covers euroccp’s costs but also acts as a deterrent as required by regulation eu no 2362012 on short selling together with certain aspects of credit default swaps 

• liquidity risk  liquidity risk is the risk euroccp may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and at the right time to help mitigate this risk euroccp monitors its liquidity requirements 

closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which attempt to minimize the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only shortterm investments serves to help reduce liquidity risks liquidity is mainly required for securities settlement the payment and settlement obligations generally stem from the function of euroccp as a cash equity clearinghouse shares are bought and sold by clearing participants on a trading platform or otc and netted to settle two days later during the settlement the actual payment for and delivery of the shares take place this process requires intraday liquidity if counterparties which receive shares against payment are unable to settle an overnight liquidity need arises the overnight liquidity is typically very short term and is usually limited to a few days 

• market risk  euroccp is also exposed to market risk in the event that a clearing participant defaults and the market prices of the securities in its open positions have moved adversely so the clearinghouse can only close out the participant’s obligations at a loss to help mitigate market risk euroccp collects collateral from clearing participants to cover for the probable loss during normal market conditions together with contributions to the clearing fund to cover losses if a default occurred during extreme but plausible market conditions adverse movements in exchange rates affecting the value of obligations and collateral are factored into the calculation of the amount of collateral to be collected 

on a regular basis we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations any such effects to date have been minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents financial investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were 3378 million and 3003 million respectively of which 1280 million and 851 million is held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019 respectively the remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes due to the nature of these investments we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments 

as of december 31 2020 we had 12039 million in outstanding debt of which 11352 million relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixedrate obligations the remaining amounts outstanding of 687 million relates to the term loan agreement which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement as of december 31 2020 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 07 million assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the euroccp credit facility as these facilities bear interest at fluctuating rates as of december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and no outstanding borrowings under the euroccp credit facility see note 13 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements 

liquidity risk 

we are exposed to liquidity risk under certain circumstances in relation to the crossacceleration and crossdefault provisions within the term loan agreement and the revolving credit agreement as a result of the company as guarantor entering into the euroccp credit facility a default of the facility may allow lenders to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the company’s other outstanding debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which may limit the company’s liquidity business and financing activities see note 13 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements and “liquidity and capital resources” within item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis” for a discussion of debt agreements

proprietary products 

in addition to our exchanges providing a marketplace and listing venue for the trading of securities and derivatives we also calculate proprietary indices that are used as the basis for proprietary products or licensed for use by third parties these include

 

our most frequently traded products are spx options and vix options and futures in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create thirdparty indices and products accordingly we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for thirdparty indices and products 

these proprietary indices and products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indices we license their indices including on an exclusive basis as the foundation for indices index options and other products the company also acquires interests in and agrees to work jointly with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following 

 

​ 

 

spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the us economy the spx options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of the sp 500 index’s status as a bellwether spx options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices we also offer spx weeklys options which have settlements on mondays wednesdays fridays and on the last trading day of each month we believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the trading of exchangetraded volatility products with its introduction of vix futures in 2004 and vix options in 2006 the vix index although not directly tradable is based on the midpoint of realtime quotes of spx options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility the vix methodology provides the basis for the creation of vix options and futures the settlement value of vix derivatives is based on traded prices of spx options since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorter term 

listing 

cboe serves as a listing destination for etps in the us and europe in 2019 cboe’s market specifically structured and designed for etp issuers and their investors added 57 listings in the us and won 22 percent of all new us etp listings there are now 353 etps globally listed on cboe from 49 different issuers we offer fully automated opening closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process

in etps incentives are based on an lmp’s quote quality in the cboe lmp program securities which include all cboelisted etps and certain noncboelisted etps

in europe following the implementation of the directive on markets in financial instruments directive 201465eu “mifid ii” rebates are generally available if they are tied to a market making scheme or specific service 

our exchanges also charge fees for the opportunity to trade or access our exchanges including fees for tradingrelated functionality to facilitate trading we also charge fees for certain technology services terminal and other equipment rights maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services

competition 

the industry in which we operate is intensely competitive we believe we face competition on a number of factors including 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods including

 

in our proprietary products we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products such as options on spy which offer some of the market exposure of our proprietary products such as spx options

the multilisted options industry is extremely competitive we expect this trend to continue as of december 31 2019 we compete with 12 us options exchanges in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology most of the equity and etp options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges in addition the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multilisted options business to their exchanges which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multilisted options and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers to increase their volume traded

our us listed equity securities and listing services compete against nine other exchanges as of december 31 2019 several alternative trading systems “atss” and single dealer platforms and three new exchanges are planning to 

launch in 2020 market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders including national securities exchanges and numerous offexchange venues including atss and brokerdealers who internalize orders offexchange additionally issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products

the market for execution services in europe became more competitive following the introduction of mifid ii and the regulation on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 6002014 “mifir” furthermore mifid ii and mifir placed more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restricted certain types of trading activity our major competitors in europe include national stock exchanges other paneuropean mtfs and systematic internalizers 

the global fx market remains severely fragmented with transparent automated marketplaces such as cboe fx challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors while the global fx market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ecns the electronification of the spot and ndf fx market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone instant chats terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading furthermore electronification of the fx market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the united states the electronic spot fx market is also intensely competitive with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of december 31 2019 

in addition demand for our market data faces competition from other securities exchanges technology companies thirdparty market data providers and information and software vendors who have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues the sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from atss and trading venues that offer similar products distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products

technology 

cboe trading technology 

on october 7 2019 we completed the final step in our multiexchange technology migration when cboe options was migrated to our current trading platform the trading platform for our equities options and futures markets is developed owned and operated inhouse and is designed to optimize reliability speed scalability and versatility each of our exchanges provide different market models appealing to different user bases and the trading technologies support all of them further the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets such as dark pools trade reporting facility systematic internalizer largeinscale smart order routing flex options 24x5 trading and hybrid trading combining electronic and open outcry in addition cboe operates a separate fx trading platform for global fx

our trading platforms have experienced very low operational downtime and low latency the trading platforms use readily available hardware thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry also in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms new releases of software are generally deployed on a weekly basis in all of the applicable markets

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our backup data centers as well as an annual test with our us trading participants in europe we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our backup data center as well as an annual test with our european trading participants we continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities

routing and clearing 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges national securities clearing corporation “nscc” is the sole provider of clearing on our us listed equity exchanges cboe europe equities relies on lchclearnet group limited “lch” euroccp nv a dutch domiciled clearing house “euroccp” and six x clear ltd “six xclear” to clear trades in european listed equity securities as part of an interoperable clearing model 

cboe trading is a routing brokerdealer used by our four us equities exchanges and our four us options exchanges including the electronic platform portion of cboe options

regulatory environment and compliance 

various aspects of our business are subject to regulation by the sec cftc finra esma fca and afm and market participants may be subject to regulation by the sec cftc finra fca board of governors of the federal reserve us department of the treasury andor foreign regulators the following is a discussion of the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec the cftc and certain european regulators 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of the general regulatory structure and brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business 

united states 

transaction fee pilot 

in december 2018 the sec approved a transaction fee pilot in national market system “nms” stocks the “transaction fee pilot” the pilot will subject stock exchange transaction fee pricing including makertaker feeandrebate pricing models to new temporary pricing restrictions across two test groups and will require the exchanges to prepare data to be submitted to the sec the transaction fee pilot includes a test group that will prohibit rebates and linked pricing as well as a test group that will impose a cap of 00010 for removing or providing displayed liquidity once commenced the transaction fee pilot will last for up to two years with an automatic sunset at one year unless extended by the sec 

the transaction fee pilot may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or continue to challenge the transaction fee pilot and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example order flow shifts away from exchanges were to occur see “legal proceedings” for more information

proposed consolidated data plans 

in january 2020 the sec issued for public comment a proposed order the “proposed order” that would require us equities exchanges and finra to develop and file a new consolidated data plan that would replace the three current us equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions such as changes to the voting structure the deadline for public comment is february 28 2020 the sec is not bound by public comments and may or may not proceed with issuing a final order and may or may not amend the provisions of the proposed order before it issues a final order if the sec decides to issue a final order that requires the filing of a new consolidated data plan we and the other us equities exchanges and finra would be required to file that plan for public comment before the sec takes any definitive action on such new plan until and if the sec approves a new consolidated data plan the current data plans will continue to govern we cannot predict if or to the extent to which a final order may be issued by the sec if a final order were to be issued it may have a negative impact on the market data fees we charge and there could be a negative impact on our revenues for more information regarding risks related to the proposed order see “risk factors” 

europe 

brexit 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom the “uk” voted to leave the eu in a referendum the “brexit vote” on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu “brexit” and began a transition period the “transition period” lasting until december 31 2020 or until a subsequent date in the event the deadline is extended the terms of any agreements entered into during the transition period are unclear and there is uncertainty about the capital markets regulation that will apply to cboe europe equities and its customers for information regarding risks related to brexit see “risk factors” 

withdrawal of swiss equivalence and swiss counter measure 

as a result of an ongoing disagreement between the eu and switzerland the european commission allowed its mifid equivalence decision for switzerland to expire at the end of june 2019 as a result switzerland made it illegal for venues in the eu including cboe europe to trade swiss equities until this matter is resolved cboe europe has had to remove these instruments from trading and has suffered a loss of trading revenues as a result the eu and switzerland continue to negotiate however it is not clear when or if they will reach an agreement on this matter and this may continue to have an impact on our business financial condition and operating results following brexit and the end of the transition period uk trading venues including cboe europe may be permitted to resume trading in swiss equities 

capital markets union 

the european council “ec” has highlighted one of its top priorities as being the establishment of a fully functioning wellregulated capital markets union “cmu” an action plan of concrete steps was set out in september 2015 and an update of the list of initiatives was published in september 2016 more recently the ec has set up a high level forum on cmu with the ec and european parliament also seeking to reboot this project this therefore remains an ongoing project for the ec which may result in additional regulation or legislation

compliance 

us securities industry 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations “sros” which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga the “exchanges” are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” as a “national securities exchange” and are subject to oversight by the sec

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our exchange operations are subject to the sec’s oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including record keeping and the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros the exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations for example in 2013 cboe options and c2 and in 2015 edgx and edga entered into consent orders with the sec under which they were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid fines and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and the exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees to cover section 31 fees charged to the exchanges by the sec and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of section 31 fess to the sec additionally under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of the exchanges’ rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation bylaws or other governing documents of the sros or their parent companies the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

futures and swaps industrycfe and cboe sef 

the operations of each of cfe and cboe sef are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a designated contract market and in some cases requires swaps trading to be conducted on swap execution facility “sef” or designated contract market “dcm” the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market and cboe sef is a swap execution facility each of which is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act as a designated contract market cfe is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the commodity exchange act as is cboe sef as a swap execution facility each of cfe and cboe sef has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules and by participants with cboe sef rules as applicable if cfe or cboe sef fails to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations it may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of its business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of cfe’s designation as a contract market or cboe sef’s designation as a swap execution facility

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indices and based on which we have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2019 approximately 648 of our net transaction fees defined below were generated by futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products eg spx options and products based on the vix methodology eg vix options and futures the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our spx options and vix options and futures as a result our net revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology and related products and indices our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

the eu has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the eu mifir requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the eu to be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis to all eu trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing as a result owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms while similar legislation to mifir has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade internally developed and licensed index products further in 2018 the eu implemented the eu benchmark regulation which regulates users data providers and calculators of benchmarks “administrators” in the eu and among other things prohibits use of benchmarks in connection with a financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an eu member state these regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade indexbased products listed on our us exchanges as well as impact our expansion activities to establish foreign trading of our indexbased products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the us 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in developing offering and providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license

the value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indices we may be subject 

to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of exchange transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including

 

any of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading volumes and demand for market data

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations “sros” and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm and cboe sef is a sef each registered with the cftc and subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc in addition to its other sro responsibilities bzx as a listing market also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on bzx and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with bzx’s continued listing standards failure to comply with these sro responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on cboe’s reputation andor branding 

our european business is subject to regulatory oversight in the uk by the fca and in the netherlands by the afm which through the “passporting” regime provides authorization to carry on business in other member states of the eu and the european economic area in accordance with the applicable eu legislation and regulation to which our european business is subject if a regulatory authority makes a finding of non compliance conditional fines could be imposed and our licenses could be revoked any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our us markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs and members that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options and equities exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our tphs and members we have begun to perform internally more of the regulatory services that finra used to handle 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the rsas the ability of finra to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under its revised rsa our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our tphs and members and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by as applicable sros dcms and sefs pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient our sros dcm or sef could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange dcm or sef any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our sros dcm or sef may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

in addition sros are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions in light of these responsibilities some courts have held that sros are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions there is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims there is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation and increase liability andor other legal expenses further under the commodity exchange act cfe and cboe sef may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith we also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the securities industry is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees we may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors which could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results we also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and valueadded market data such as historical market data 

in our options segment the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multilisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multilisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multilisted options products including spy which offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

to attract market share we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or notransaction fee trading from time to time bzx also offers a “crossasset add volume tier” that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the bzx equities and options platforms these forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes such as the transaction fee pilot force us to reduce fees

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease 

in 2019 approximately 629 of our net revenues were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges cfe or notional value traded on cboe fx cboe sef and cboe europe equities exchanges decreases we are likely to see a decrease in transaction fees 

our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as

 

over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including the collins amendment to doddfrank mifid ii and mifir may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our exchanges

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts if the amount of our trading volume decreases the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products or the transaction fee pilot is implemented our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease

revenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share trading volumes or regulatory changes 

the occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive whether as a result of fee reductions fewer members subscribing to the us tape plans declines in market share or trading volumes or notional volume in the case of cboe europe equities or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results for example if our market share of us listed equities and options or cboe’s european equities trading were to decline our share of market data fees could also decline moreover market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users for example because of consolidation among 

market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise 

regulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity or our cost in providing such services in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees in recent years certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products specifically the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” has filed a number of denial of access applications with the sec to set aside proposed rule changes to establish or modify fees for our market data products access and capacity fees and related services further the sec and some media have scrutinized market data and market access an adverse ruling in these matters or additional scrutiny could cause the sec to more closely examine exchange market data and access and capacity fees which in turn could result in our having to reduce the fees we charge for market data and access and capacity and there could be a negative impact on our revenues see “legal proceedings” for more information 

in addition as discussed above in january 2020 the sec issued for public comment the proposed order that would require us equities exchanges and finra to develop and file a new consolidated data plan if a final order were to be issued it may have a negative impact on the market data fees we charge and there could be a negative impact on our revenues 

we believe cboe europe equities currently offers market data to customers on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost as regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our european market data revenues while mifid ii and mifir aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in europe should this fail to materialize policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc fca afm foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries we have also experienced an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business 

starting in 2015 large us banks were required to use a calculation methodology known as the current exposure method “cem” to compute regulatory capital requirements associated with the clearing guarantee provided by bankaffiliated occ clearing members us banks as well as european banks that also apply cem are required to maintain regulatory capital that is disproportionate to the risk of clearing options contracts and has led to further increases in capital requirements for bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives in november 2019 the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency approved replacing cem with a more risksensitive calculation method known as the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk “saccr” which is expected to reduce capital requirements associated with the clearing of listed options banks are required to adopt saccr by january 1 2022 but may do so as early as april 1 2020 if the implementation of saccr does not occur earlier than 2022 during that time we may experience a reduction in trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated clearing members charging their customers more to trade reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of marketmaker clearing 

further congress regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading and the structure of equity markets in recent years the sec continues to consider various potential market structure changes which could result in reduced trading volumes or which could negatively affect our business to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter see note 

24 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity such as the proposed order our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 

in addition as discussed above in december 2018 the sec approved the transaction fee pilot the transaction fee pilot may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the transaction fee pilot and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example shifts in order flow away from exchanges were to occur see “legal proceedings” for more information

under eu regulations european banks and other european financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu however the occ is working with the eu to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent as a prerequisite to becoming qualified occ could be required by the eu to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default this capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of nondefaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted occ’s stockholders including cboe options could effectively be required to fund this capital if the eu does not recognize occ as a qualified clearinghouse by june 15 2021 or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended then european market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in europe mifid ii and mifir have introduced a number of new rules including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements which apply directly to european trading venues such as our mtf and rm the impact of mifid ii and mifir is significant and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees while increasing our costs of operating in europe additionally european authorities are planning to review mifid in 2020 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business 

the legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot fx market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot fx industry the fx global code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale fx market and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements may also adversely affect our spot fx business further our fx nondeliverable forwards business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us or europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business 

in addition us and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our exchanges and markets 

the technology upon which we rely including those of our service providers may be vulnerable to security risks cybersecurity risks insider threats unauthorized disclosure of confidential information operational disruptions and other risks and events that could harm our business 

the secure and reliable operation of our technology including our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential commercially sensitive or personally identifiable information data theft corruption or destruction cyberattack malware and other security problems as well as acts of terrorism natural disasters human error criminal insider activity power loss and other events that are beyond our control for example in 2018 we discovered and in 2018 and 2019 we investigated an incident involving a suspected theft of computer servers and networking devices 

we currently maintain physical technical and administrative safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity availability and reliability of our systems networks and information more broadly and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access we also maintain and continue to enhance policies procedures and controls for tracking and appropriately disposing of technology equipment hardware during technology updates and around the protection of our computer systems and communications networks collectively these safeguards and measures may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents subjecting us to contractual restrictions liability and damages loss of business penalties unfavorable publicity and increased scrutiny by our regulators and materially impacting our financial condition and operating results we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability such harms also could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business financial condition and operating results 

additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

the market for trade execution services and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction fees and market data fees thereby adversely affecting our operating results we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation see “business – competition”

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can in addition our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop introduce andor market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products 

furthermore new or existing competitors may



 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

we depend on thirdparty service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ nscc lch euroccp and six xclear securities information processors such as the cta utp securities information processor and opra regulatory and other service providers such as finra nfa and occ the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers and various vendors of communications and networking products and services in addition we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing transactions on our behalf more specifically 

 

with respect to options all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2019 there were 98 tphs that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for approximately 489 of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2019 the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 166 of transaction and other fees collected through occ additionally the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe options c2 bzx edgx and at all of the options exchanges should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges impose additional marketmaker financial requirements or if marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity this could create a significant disruption to the options markets including ours

we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements such as moving clearing to another clearing agency in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

our operations outside of the us expose us to currency risk 

in addition to our operations in the us we have operations in the uk continental europe ecuador hong kong and singapore we therefore have exposure to exchange rate movements between the british pound the euro the hong kong dollar and the singapore dollar against the us dollar significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions acts of war or terrorism changes in governmental monetary or tax policy brexit or changes in local interest rates these exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our nonus results of operations and financial condition into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change or if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer 

we are a party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indices including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 sp 100 and sp select sectors indices djia lseg and msci these license agreements provide that we are authorized to list products based on their indices and some of the resulting index options and futures are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges we also enter into licensing agreements pursuant to which we calculate and disseminate values of proprietary indices the quality and integrity of each of these indices are dependent on the ability of the index providers including us to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers including us are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index options and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some potential patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry and even if we believe that such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringement if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products services or technologies our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees however we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us the roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business financial condition and operating results 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we have historically done 

additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

our business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems if our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services these consequences could result in trading outages lower trading volumes financial losses decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup plan of significant trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite having disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all following a systems failure moreover with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely

our markets have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following

 

any of these events may cause

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

misconduct by our tphs members participants or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs members participants or other persons who use our markets or our products or our employees may engage in fraud market or product manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market or product manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market or product manipulation by or failures of 

participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges or of our products which could reduce revenues

our use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re  engineer our software which could harm our business 

our technology platform uses open source software code companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software in addition some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated we believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code however if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in or impose significant costs on our business

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs and members for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

brexit could have a negative impact on the uk and eu economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated 

in addition to the economic uncertainty the brexit vote brexit and transition period bring there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider 



 

once the uk ceases to be a member state of the eu the current passporting arrangements are expected to cease to be effective as will the current mutual rights of access to market infrastructure and current arrangements for mutual recognition of bank recovery and resolution regimes the ability of regulated financial institutions to continue to do business between the uk and the eu27 after the uk ceases to be a member state of the eu would therefore be subject to separate arrangements between the uk and the eu27 there can be no assurance that there will be any such arrangements concluded and if they are concluded on what terms

 

in 2019 we derived 77 of our total net revenues from our uk operations depending on the outcome of the brexit and transition period negotiations companies with operations in the uk may face unfavorable business conditions to access the single market in preparation for brexit cboe europe equities established a regulated entity in the eu in addition to its existing entity in the uk so that it can continue offering its services to customers in both jurisdictions nevertheless if the eu or the uk introduce new legislation that could restrict free competition or access to capital markets the impact of such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation various issues may give rise to reputational risk including issues relating to 

 

damage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our exchanges or cause us to lose customers this in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

if our risk management and compliance methods are not effective our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance risk audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance risk and audit management personnel these systems and procedures may not be fully effective we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of actual or alleged non compliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which may be substantial in the past the sec has brought actions against exchange operators including us for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and operating results and in extreme cases our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws sec fca afm and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk if our policies procedures and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that our management compliance department risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these departments or the enterprise risk program and related policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

financial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers clearing agents and counterparties for example we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity operational failure bankruptcy or other reasons

in addition with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates wedbush securities inc “wedbush” and morgan stanley  co llc “morgan stanley” guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that wedbush or morgan stanley fails to perform with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

with respect to us equities cboe trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to wedbush and morgan stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date cboe trading uses wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of credit suisse securities usa llc as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools morgan stanley clears trades routed through the morgan stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools cboe trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution 

with respect to us listed equity and exchange traded product options cboe trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution 

our exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers and other third parties to satisfy their contractual obligations to us moreover we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

while neither cboe fx nor cboe sef has direct counterparty risk cboe fx or cboe sef may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx and cboe sef may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot fx on the cboe fx platform or nondeliverable forward fx transactions on cboe sef 

we may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service which could subject us to trading losses when our brokerdealer disposes of that position 

we offer a smartorder routing service through our broker dealer subsidiary cboe trading which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution in connection with this service we may assume ownership of a position in securities this may occur for example when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systems problems and is unable to determine the status of that order when this happens we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order we may be informed later however that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it in which case cboe trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of cboe trading into which such positions settle and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible which could result in our incurring trading losses 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions if we fail to manage our growth effectively our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed furthermore failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our business financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe or cboe sef the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays including 

because of a government shutdown or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe global markets the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income if this occurs we may experience a higher effective tax rate

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

for example in 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of stock of euroccp other than the shares of euroccp already owned by us the “transaction” the transaction which we plan to fund with cash on hand is expected to close in the first half of 2020 and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions precedent including i the receipt of required regulatory clearances and approvals and ii the successful implementation of a supporting euro 15 billion committed syndicated credit liquidity facility at the euroccp clearing entity level additionally in february 2020 we acquired hanweck associates llc “hanweck” a realtime risk analytics company based in new york and the business of ft providers llc a portfolio management platform provider based in chicago commonly referred to as ft options “ft” 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be required to inject further capital into occ or euroccp or return dividends received back to occ 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges in addition cboe europe currently owns 20 of euroccp which is one of three interoperable central counterparties used to clear trades conducted on 

cboe europe on january 24 2020 upon receipt of sec approval occ established a capital management policy providing that if occ’s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds occ can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members although cboe options does not have a legal or contractual obligation to contribute capital to occ under occ’s capital management policy or otherwise given occ’s importance to cboe options’ business if occ were to experience financial difficulties cboe options might nevertheless effectively but not legally be required to inject further capital into it in order for occ to maintain sufficient working or regulatory capital likewise notwithstanding the pending transaction if euroccp were to experience financial difficulties cboe europe might effectively be required to inject further capital into euroccp in order to maintain sufficient working or regulatory capital in a worst case scenario occ or euroccp as applicable might have their regulatory license suspended or withdrawn or might have to wind down this may result in a loss to cboe options and cboe europe of their respective investments in occ and euroccp and withdrawals of occ or euroccp as clearing houses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition while occ’s new capital management policy is now effective there remains some degree of uncertainty as to the terms and conditions of the winddown of occ’s prior capital plan under which occ’s shareholders including cboe options provided equity capital to occ and received annual dividends in respect thereof and which was disapproved by the sec on february 13 2019 depending on the terms on which the prior occ capital plan is ultimately required to be unwound cboe options could potentially be required to return dividend payments received from occ during the time the capital plan was in effect 

we have outstanding indebtedness which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as of december 31 2019 we had 225 million outstanding under our term loan facility 650 million of senior unsecured notes and no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions our indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements we are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes further a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control

we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

as of december 31 2019 we have investment grade credit ratings from sp global ratings a and moody’s investor service a3 ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs could increase 

if our goodwill longlived assets investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired the resulting charge to earnings may be significant 

we are required to assess investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill longlived assets intangible assets or investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe global markets depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions

 ​ 

in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

​ 

 

furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors 

furthermore the european countries where we operate regulated entities such as the uk and netherlands may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock

the company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of the companys board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant future debt obligations and statutory provisions among other things may limit or in some cases prohibit our ability to pay dividends

occ capital plan 

in december 2014 occ announced a newlyformed capital plan under which each of occs existing exchange stockholders agreed to contribute its prorata share based on ownership percentage of 150 million in equity capital which would increase occs shareholders equity and to provide its pro rata share in replenishment capital up to a maximum of 40 million per exchange stockholder if certain capital thresholds were breached occ also adopted policies under the plan with respect to fees customer refunds and stockholder dividends which envisioned an annual 

dividend payment to the exchange stockholders on march 3 2015 in accordance with the plan cboe options contributed 30 million to occ that contribution has been recorded under investments in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019 and 2018 

the sec initially issued a notice of no objection to occ’s advance notice filing regarding the capital plan and subsequently approved occ’s proposed rule filing for the capital plan but certain petitioners appealed the sec approval order to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the court ultimately remanded the matter to the sec and on february 13 2019 the sec issued an order disapproving the proposed rule change implementing occ’s capital plan in an effort to achieve compliance with its target capital requirements in the absence of an approved capital plan occ i retained funds that otherwise would have been paid to stockholders as dividends and to clearing members as refunds with respect to 2018 and ii raised its clearing fees in connection with the disapproval of the capital plan occ returned the capital that had been contributed by its shareholders under the disapproved plan equal to 300 million for cboe options to the respective shareholders in 2019 of which 220 million was returned to cboe options in the first quarter of 2019 and 80 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 with each return of capital described in this paragraph the company also incurred a tax expense occ agreed to reimburse the company for part of that tax liability and paid the company 11 million in the third quarter and 04 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 occ did not pay its shareholders any dividend or other return on the retained portion of their capital contributions as such the company reversed the 88 million occ dividend declared in 2018 which was to be paid in 2019 in other income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2019 the remaining contributed capital has been recorded under investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019

on january 24 2020 upon receipt of sec approval occ established a new capital management policy intended to replace the disapproved capital plan the new capital management policy provides that if occ’s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds occ can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members none of occ’s shareholders including cboe options has any obligation to contribute capital to occ under the new capital management policy nor does any shareholder have the right to receive dividends from occ under such policy

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

revenue recognition 

for further discussion related to revenue recognition of fees such as transaction fees and liquidity payments access and capacity fees market data fees and regulation transaction and section 31 fees see note 4 “revenue recognition”

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions of bats cboe vest financial group inc “vest” silexx financial systems llc “silexx” and livevol resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350— intangibles—goodwill and other  we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using the october 1 carrying values goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with asc 35020 if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess if the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is less than their carrying value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2019 and determined that no impairment existed 

the estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach using discounted estimated future cash flows the estimated fair values of indefinitelived intangibles used the income approach the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgment including judgments about the discount rate anticipated revenue growth rate and operating expenses that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period as such actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if updated estimates indicate that the fair value of goodwill or any indefinitelived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate 

purchase accounting 

tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense when available the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices information from comparable transactions offers made by other prospective acquirers in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness level 1 and 2 unobservable inputs such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value level 3 are used if observable inputs are not available as noted in asc 805— business combinations  the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to twelve months after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed see note 5 “acquisitions” for additional information

stockbased compensation 

we have historically granted stockbased compensation to our employees in the form of restricted stock units with the acquisition of bats we also assumed bats’ grants of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees we record the related stockbased compensation expense based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by fasb the company used the monte carlo valuation model method to estimate the fair value of the total shareholder return performance share units which incorporated the following assumptions riskfree interest rate threeyear volatility and three year correlation with sp 500 index we recognize these stockbased compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we recognized stockbased compensation expense of approximately 218 million 351 million and 501 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively this expense is included in the compensation and benefits expense and acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in our opinion it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 

the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based upon the technical merits of the position the 

tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement also interest and penalties expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions the company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk equity risk credit risk and interest rate risk we have implemented policies and procedures to measure manage and monitor and report risk exposures which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our operations in europe and asia are subject to increased currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound singapore dollar hong kong dollar and the euro we also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies including the swiss franc norwegian kroner swedish krona and danish kroner

for the year ended december 31 2019 our exposure to foreigndenominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table 

 

 

equity risk 

our investment in european operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to us dollars the assets and liabilities of our european business are denominated in british pounds or euros fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of these nonus dollar statements of financial condition into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

​ 

our primary exposure to this equity risk as of december 31 2019 is presented by foreign currency in the following table 

 

 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers counterparties and clearing agents these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we limit our exposure to credit risk by considering such risk when selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the us and europe with respect to listed equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the nscc without taking on counterparty risk for those trades nscc acts as a central counterparty on all equity transactions occurring on bzx byx edgx and edga and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades

with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms morgan stanley or wedbush morgan stanley and wedbush guarantee trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that morgan stanley or wedbush fails we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees

historically we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or more visible market participants could also result in marketwide credit difficulties or other market disruptions

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot fx trades occurring on our platform because cboe fx is not a counterparty to any fx transactions all transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade while cboe fx does not have direct counterparty risk cboe fx may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade fx on the cboe fx platform

we also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our balance sheet our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets

on a regular basis we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations any such effects to date have been minimal

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents financial investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2019 and 2018 our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were 3003 million and 3108 million respectively of which 851 million and 729 million is held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries in 2019 and 2018 respectively the remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes due to the nature of these investments we have not been exposed to nor do we 

anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments 

as of december 31 2019 we had 8750 million in outstanding debt of which 6500 million relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixedrate obligations the remaining amount outstanding of 2250 million relates to the term loan agreement which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement as of december 31 2019 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 23 million assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as this facility bears interest at fluctuating rates as of december 31 2019 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement see note 13 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements

proprietary products 

in addition to our exchanges providing a marketplace and listing venue for the trading of securities and derivatives that meet criteria established in the rules of their respective exchanges we also offer trading in products and licenses based on our own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility index products based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the sp 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks such as the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and the cboe sp 500 smile index and options strategy benchmarks such as buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and russell 2000 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes our most frequently traded products are spx options and vix options and futures in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indexes we have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense certain indexes we generate revenue from both the calculation and dissemination of index values and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes including on an exclusive basis as the foundation for indexes index options and other products the company also acquires interests in and forms partnerships with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following 



 









spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indexes and is considered a bellwether for the us economy the options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of its status as a bellwether spx is traded in a number of different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices we also offer spx weeklys options which we believe that traders are using to fine tune the timing of hedging strategies and maximize the risk premium in strategies that involve the sale of options such as covered call writing 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the volatility trading space with its introduction of futures on the vix index in 2004 and options on the vix index in 2006 the vix index is based on realtime prices of options on the sp 500 index and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorter term 

trading volumes in options and futures on the vix index may be especially sensitive to market volatility with increases in volume generally occurring along with spikes in volatility while we believe that there will be continued intrinsic growth in our volatility products significant changes in the levels of market volatility may significantly impact volumes in these products 

listing 

cboe serves as a listing destination for etps in the us and europe in 2018 cboe’s market specifically structured and designed for etp issuers and their investors added 61 listings and won 23 percent of all new us etp listings there are now 290 etps globally listed on cboe from 55 different issuers we offer fully‑automated opening closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process 

 

cboe also offers issuers the choice of a more traditional market maker program referred to as the cboe lead market maker “lmm” program on cboe bzx and the cboe europe equities liquidity provider program “lpp” on cboe europe equities an lmm has certain quoting obligations and for meeting those enhanced obligations cboe pays the lmm an enhanced rebate for executions against its displayed orders in the issuer’s security and charges a reduced fee when the lmm executes against other orders in the issuer’s security under the lpp cboe europe equities offers three programs designed for participants that wish to provide liquidity by posting and maintaining executable quotes within certain set parameters with the result of providing liquidity on a regular and ongoing basis cboe bzx also offers the cboe liquidity management provider “lmp” program “lmp program” the lmp program is a rewardsbased program that incentivizes liquidity providers to make a better market in etps incentives are based on an lmp’s quote quality in the cboe lmp program securities which include all cboelisted etps and certain noncboelisted etps 

market data 

we derive a portion of our revenue from market data fees from us tape plans including unlisted trading privileges “utps” the consolidated tape association “cta” and opra fees net of plan costs from utp cta and opra are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula required by regulation nms which may take into account both trading and quoting activity 

we also provide a robust offering of market data products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs products include realtime depth of book quotation information auction and complex option information top of book quotes and trades last sale information consolidated equity feeds realtime index values and trade reporting facility information we also provide analytics services and historical information for our markets through multiple data services 

our models 

to meet various market demands we utilize a variety of market and pricing models cboe options utilizes various models in different listed options classes with different combinations of customer priority participation rights and prorata modified prorata or pricetime priority depending on the product we have adopted a prorata model on listed equity options trading on c2 and edgx cboe options and edgx options utilize a “classic” pricing model that charges a fee to market makers and a portion of that fee is then provided back to customers’ brokers known as payment for order flow the classic pricing model also provides customers with rebates and volume incentive programs and charges fees to noncustomers in our proprietary products we assess transaction fees on all participants with the amount of the fee based on the market participant’s role and the origin of the underlying order and subject to discounts based on relative volume or trading strategies 

cfe utilizes a pricetime priority model for vix futures and clients are charged transaction fees that vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s central limit order book or is a block trade cfe also has rebate schedules for vix futures that provide rebates for satisfying designated trading volume thresholds and has also adopted a maker–taker fee structure for weekly vix futures 

we have adopted a pricetime priority model and “makertaker” and “takermaker” pricing models in certain of our markets under our “makertaker” pricing model on bzx for both listed cash equity securities and listed equity options edgx for listed cash equity securities and c2 options a customer posting an order on our book the “liquidity maker” is paid a rebate for an execution occurring against that order a customer executing against an order resting on our book the “liquidity taker” is charged a fee we generate a substantial portion of our operating income from the difference between the “maker” rebate and the “taker” fee although customers must pay a fee to access that liquidity that fee is explicitly disclosed and charged to all customers on a nondiscriminatory basis conversely the byx and edga listed cash equity securities “takermaker” pricing model provides that a liquidity taker will be paid a rebate and the liquidity maker will be charged a fee in europe following the implementation of mifid ii rebates are no longer generally available unless they are tied to a market making scheme or specific service cboe europe equities is therefore moving away from its traditional makertaker pricing model to one where a participant must meet certain performance criteria to earn rebates 

 

the cboe fx platform uses a price‑firmnesstime priority model and clients are charged either a flat or tiered commission rate based upon the notional amount traded on the platform 

our exchanges also charge fees for the opportunity to trade or access our exchanges including fees for tradingrelated functionality to facilitate trading we also charge fees for certain technology services terminal and other equipment rights maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services 

customers 

our customers include financial institutions institutional and individual investors and professional traders our equities and options customers in the united states include trading permit holders and members of cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga which are sec‑registered broker‑dealers and the clients of those broker‑dealers our futures customers include banks futures commission merchants hedge funds asset managers proprietary trading firms and commodity trading advisors similarly our equities’ customers in europe are european union “eu” regulated brokerage and proprietary trading firms as well as sponsored access clients of these brokerage firms and certain noneu regulated and unregulated direct access participants our institutional spot fx customers include banks broker‑dealers hedge funds asset managers proprietary trading firms commodity trading advisors and corporates access to our markets trading rights and privileges depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a trading permit holder trading privilege holder member or participant of one of our markets 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is intensely competitive we believe we face competition on a number of factors including 













we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods including 















in our proprietary products we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products such as options on spy which offer some of the market exposure of our proprietary products such as options on spx 

the multiplylisted options industry is extremely competitive we expect this trend to continue the number of us options exchanges that we compete with is 11 exchanges as of december 31 2018 in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded 

 

on the other options exchanges in addition the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multiplylisted options business to their exchanges which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multiplylisted options and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers to increase their volume traded 

our us listed cash equity securities and listing services compete against nine other exchanges and several alternative trading systems “atss” market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders including national securities exchanges and numerous off‑exchange venues including atss operating “dark pools” that do not publicly display quotations “lit” atss that publicly display quotations operating as electronic communication networks and broker‑dealers who internalize orders off‑exchange additionally issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products including other national and regional exchanges 

the market for execution services in europe has become significantly more competitive following the introduction of the markets in financial instruments directive directive 200439ec “mifid” we expect that competition in paneuropean trading will continue to increase in the near term though the directive on markets in financial instruments directive 201465eu repealing directive 200439ec “mifid ii” and the regulation on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 6002014 “mifir” place more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restrict certain types of trading activity new mtfs emerged that have captured significant market share from existing national exchanges our major competitors in europe include national stock exchanges and other paneuropean market operators as of december 31 2018 

the spot fx market remains severely fragmented with transparent automated marketplaces such as cboe fx challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors while the spot fx market recently has been experiencing a shift from competing interbank platforms to ecns the electronification of the spot fx market may encounter resistance from clients that still prefer to utilize the phone instant chats terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading furthermore electronification of the fx market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the united states the electronic spot fx market is also intensely competitive with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of december 31 2018 

in addition demand for our market data faces competition from other securities exchanges technology companies thirdparty market data providers and information and software vendors who have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges the sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from atss and trading venues that offer similar products distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we believe that our recovery time in the event of an outage is comparable to or better than that of our competitors we regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our backup data centers as well as an annual test with our us trading participants in europe we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our backup data center as well as an annual test with our european trading participants we continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities 

routing and clearing 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges national securities clearing corporation “nscc” is the sole provider of clearing on our us listed cash equity exchanges cboe europe equities relies on lchclearnet group limited “lch” euroccp nv a dutch domiciled clearing house “euroccp” and six x‑clear ltd “six xclear” to clear trades in european listed equity securities as part of an interoperable clearing model 

cboe trading is a routing brokerdealer used by our four us equity exchanges and our bzx c2 and edgx exchanges for options

united states 

transaction fee pilot 

in december 2018 the sec approved a transaction fee pilot in national market system “nms” stocks the “transaction fee pilot” the pilot will subject stock exchange transaction fee pricing including makertaker feeandrebate pricing models to new temporary pricing restrictions across two test groups and require the exchanges to prepare data to be submitted to the sec the pilot includes a test group that will prohibit rebates and linked pricing as well as a test group that will impose a cap of 00010 for removing or providing displayed liquidity once commenced the pilot will last for up to two years with an automatic sunset at one year unless extended by the sec 

the transaction fee pilot may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the pilot and it may have a material impact on our business financial

compliance 

us securities industry 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations “sros” which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga the “exchanges” are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” as a “national securities exchange” and are subject to oversight by the sec 

 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our exchange operations are subject to the sec’s oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including record keeping and the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros the exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations for example on june 11 2013 cboe options and c2 entered into a consent order with the sec under which cboe options and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are also required to certify until 2019 in addition on january 12 2015 edgx and edga entered into a consent order with the sec under which edgx and edga were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid a fine of 14 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and the exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees to cover section 31 fees charged to the exchanges by the sec and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of section 31 fess to the sec additionally under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of the exchanges’ rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation bylaws or other governing documents of the sros or their parent companies the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

futures and swaps industrycfe and cboe sef 

the operations of each of cfe and cboe sef are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a designated contract market and in some cases requires swaps trading to be conducted on swap execution facility “sef” or designated contract market “dcm” the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded designation 

 

as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of a specified futures or swaps contracts is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market and cboe sef is a swap execution facility each of which is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act as a designated contract market cfe is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the commodity exchange act as is cboe sef as a swap execution facility each of cfe and cboe sef has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules and by participants with sef rules as applicable if cfe or cboe sef fails to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations it may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of its business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of cfe’s designation as a contract market or cboe sef’s designation as a swap execution facility 

europe 

our european stock exchange cboe europe equities  is located in london and subject to regulation in the united kingdom and to certain european regulations cboe europe equities has applied to the netherlands authority for the financial markets to become a regulated market in the netherlands the application is expected to be decided by the end of the first quarter of 2019 the current united kingdom regulatory system was established by the financial services act 2012 “fsa12” which amended the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” the legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator the financial services authority with three new bodies the financial policy committee “fpc” the prudential regulation authority “pra” and the fca the fpc is a committee of the bank of england and sets policy for financial regulation it is made up of the governor and other senior figures within the bank along with the chief executives of the pra and fca and senior industry figures the pra is responsible for the prudential regulation of banks insurance companies and other systemically important institutions financial conduct of markets including activity on and the operation of markets is regulated by the fca which is an independent non‑governmental body given statutory powers by the fsa12 the fca has three statutory objectives to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services the fca is accountable to her majesty’s treasury ministers and through them to parliament 

fsma as amended by fsa12 governs the regulation of financial services and markets in the uk under section 19 of fsma any person who carries on a regulated activity in the uk must be authorized by the appropriate authority or exempt recognized bodies which include exchanges and clearing houses are exempt breach of section 19 may be a criminal offense and punishable on indictment by a maximum term of two years imprisonment andor a fine the fsma regulated activities order 2001 which is secondary legislation under fsma details regulated activities and specified investments 

once a firm is authorized or recognized by the fca it is required to meet the standards set out in its handbook of rules and guidance and to supply the fca with information so that the fca can monitor the firm’s business the fca supervises the firm according to the risks that it poses to the fca’s statutory objectives 

much of the uk financial services regulation originates in the european union on november 1 2007 mifid which replaced the investment services directive came into force and was implemented by eea member states mifid aims to harmonize european financial services businesses by setting out provisions governing organizational and conduct of business requirements that apply to firms and the requirements applicable to rms for example stock exchanges and mtfs mifid also aims to facilitate cross‑border business by extending the concept of “passporting” which allows firms authorized to carry on business in one eea member state to carry on business in other eea member states 

as an rie that operates both an rm and an mtf cboe europe equities is required to comply with the relevant uk requirements as set out in the fca handbook including where applicable relevant european directives and regulations as implemented or which apply directly in the uk these requirements include organizational 

 

requirements capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for rms and mtfs mifid sets out requirements for rms and mtfs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non‑discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on rms and mtfs and monitoring compliance with the rules the regulatory functions required of cboe europe equities by mifid are performed by in‑house staff cboe europe equities utilizes the same state‑of‑the‑art real‑time surveillance system that we use to monitor trading and market activities on bzx byx edga and edgx 

mifid has been updated and the new legislation known as mifid ii and mifir was implemented january 3 2018 and generally tightens the requirements placed on both exchanges and investment firms in particular use of certain waivers from pre‑trade transparency are capped as a percentage of total market volume and a general trading obligation requires almost all equity trades to be conducted on a duly registered trading venue furthermore mifid ii and mifir extend mandatory transparency requirements to non‑equity markets such as fixed income 

global fx 

while the global institutional spot fx market remains largely unregulated the enactment of the dodd frank act and its related regulations in the united states and the ongoing implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products for example certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as an sef or dcm in the united states or on an mtf or otf in europe moreover even in the largely unregulated spot fx market this movement towards additional trading standards and norms is highlighted by the publication of the fx global code in 2017 by the global foreign exchange committee reflecting principles of good conduct for the wholesale fx market the “global code” and whose publication may lead to additional oversight in the global fx market

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indexes and based on which we have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2018 approximately 647 of our net transaction fees defined below were generated by futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products and products based on the vix methodology the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our sp 500 index options and vix index options and futures as a result our net revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

the eu has adopted legislation commonly referred to as mifir that will require the person with proprietary rights to a benchmark to provide nondiscriminatory access to that benchmark to trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing licenses to the benchmark must be provided on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms in addition the eu implemented at the beginning of 2018 legislation known as the benchmark regulation that may impact the ability of european investors to trade our us benchmark products if they are not recognized authorized endorsed or deemed equivalent in the eu while similar legislation to mifir has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose exclusivity in our internally developed and licensed index products the new european legislation may impact our expansion activities of our us benchmark products in europe and may reduce the volume on our us options and futures exchanges from international customers 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures 

 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of exchange transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 





































any of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading volumes and demand for market data 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations “sros” and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a designated contract market “dcm” and cboe sef is a swap execution facility “sef” each registered with the cftc and subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc in addition to its other sro responsibilities bzx as a listing market also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on bzx and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with bzx’s continued listing standards failure to comply with these sro responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on cboe’s reputation or branding 

our european business is subject to regulatory oversight in the uk by the uk financial conduct authority “fca” which through the “passporting” regime provides authorization to carry on business in other member states of the eu and the european economic area in accordance with the applicable eu legislation and regulation to which our european business is subject if a regulatory authority makes a finding of non‑compliance conditional fines could be imposed and our licenses could be revoked any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our us markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs and members that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options and equities exchanges and nfa with respect to our 

 

futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our tphs and members 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by as applicable sros dcms and sefs pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient our sros dcm or sef could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange dcm or sef any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our sros dcm or sef may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate for example if we are unable to fulfill our obligations under the consent orders with the sec with respect to cboe options and c2 it may have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition sros are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions in light of those responsibilities courts have held that sros are immune from damages for some civil claims related to actions that are incident to their regulatory responsibilities there is a risk that a court might not adopt the immunity doctrine and whether a court that recognizes the doctrine would apply it to a claim depends on the nature of the claim in addition we could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the securities industry is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees we may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors which could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results we also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and valueadded market data such as historical market data 

in our options segment the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products including spy which offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

 

to attract market share we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or no‑transaction fee trading from time to time bzx also offers a “cross‑asset add volume tier” that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the bzx equities and options platforms these forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes such as the transaction fee pilot force us to reduce fees 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease 

in 2018 approximately 686 of our net revenues were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges cfe or notional value traded on cboe fx and cboe europe equities exchanges decreases we are likely to see a decrease in transaction fees 

our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 















over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including the collins amendment to doddfrank mifid ii and mifir may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts if the amount of our trading volume decreases the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products or the transaction fee pilot is implemented our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

our market data fees connectivity fees and revenues may be reduced due to declines in our market share trading volumes or regulatory changes 

the occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive whether as a result of fee reductions fewer members subscribing to the us tape plans declines in market share or trading volumes or notional volume in the case of cboe europe equities or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results for example if our market share of us listed cash equities and options or cboe’s european cash equities trading were to decline our share of market data fees could also decline moreover market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise 

 

regulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and connectivity or our cost in providing such services in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and connectivity fees in recent years certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products specifically the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” has filed a number of denial of access applications with the sec to set aside proposed rule changes to establish or modify fees for our market data products connectivity fees and related services further the sec and some media have been scrutinizing market data and market access in late 2018 an adverse ruling in these matters or additional scrutiny could cause the sec to more closely examine exchange market data and connectivity fees which in turn could result in our having to reduce the fees we charge for market data and connectivity and there could be a negative impact on our revenues see note 23 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information 

we believe cboe europe equities currently offers market data to customers on a non‑discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost as regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our european market data revenues while mifid ii and mifir aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in europe should this fail to materialize policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc fca foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries we have also experienced an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business 

starting in 2015 large us banks were required to use a calculation methodology known as the current exposure method “cem” to compute regulatory capital requirements associated with the clearing guarantee provided by bankaffiliated occ clearing members us banks as well as european banks that also apply cem are required to maintain regulatory capital that is disproportionate to the risk of clearing options contracts and has led to further increases in capital requirements for bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives in october 2018 the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency proposed to replace cem with a more risksensitive calculation method known as the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk “saccr” which is expected to reduce capital requirements associated with the clearing of listed options if cem is not replaced or the implementation of saccr does not reduce capital requirements we may experience a reduction in trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated clearing members charging their customers more to trade reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of marketmaker clearing 

further congress regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading the structure of equity markets and high frequency trading in recent years the sec continues to consider various potential market structure changes which could result in reduced trading volumes or which could negatively affect our business to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition the continued growth of high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and regulatory enforcement actions alleging that high frequency trading firms have received unfair advantages at the expense of other traders high frequency trading accounts for a meaningful percentage of the daily volume in the us and european equity markets and these actions and other efforts to slow trading could lead to a reduction in trading volumes negatively impacting all trading markets including our business additionally in september 2018 the sec held a roundtable on market data and market access to discuss a number of topics including market data revenue received by exchanges to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes related to market data and market access connectivity our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 

 

in addition as discussed above in december 2018 the sec approved the transaction fee pilot the transaction fee pilot may cause cboe’s equities exchanges bzx byx edgx and edga to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the pilot and it may have a material impact on our business financial condition and operating results if for example shifts in order flow away from exchanges were to occur see note 23 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information 

under eu regulations european banks and other european financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu however the occ is working with the eu to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent as a prerequisite to becoming qualified occ could be required by the eu to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default this capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of nondefaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted occ’s stockholders including cboe options could effectively be required to fund this capital if the eu does not recognize occ as a qualified clearinghouse by june 15 2019 or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended then european market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

mifid came into effect in 2007 regulating the market for execution services within european listed cash equity securities mifid has been superseded and enhanced by mifid ii and mifir which were implemented at the beginning of 2018 the implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe has resulted in an alteration of the existing mifid structure that has encouraged competition among market centers in europe mifid ii and mifir introduce a number of new rules including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements which apply directly to european trading venues such as our mtf and rm the impact of mifid ii and mifir is significant and could reduce trading volumes and trading fees while increasing our costs of operating in europe 

the legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot fx market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot fx industry spot fx market participants have seen an increasing number of law enforcement actions and regulatory inquiries into their business practices resulting in the publication of the global code as a means to reach global consensus on standards of good conduct in the wholesale fx market the governmental bodies and regulatory organizations that regulate parts of the spot fx market may enact propose and may consider legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these entities or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements may also adversely affect our spot fx business further our fx nondeliverable forwards business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us or europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business 

in addition us and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our exchanges and markets 

 

a failure to migrate our information technology systems successfully following the merger or a material disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems the failure of information technology systems to operate effectively difficulty in migrating our information technology systems inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results in addition a number of our tphs are not connected to bats’ technology platforms and must complete the process of connecting to these platforms as part of the migration 

although we have successfully migrated cfe and c2 to the bats’ technology platforms the process of migrating cboe options may take longer cost more and provide fewer synergies than initially anticipated there may also be new regulations adopted during the transition period that require systems changes which could divert attention away from migration process and cause delays to the extent this occurs the anticipated benefits of the bats acquisition may be reduced or delayed or may never come to fruition although our combined management team has experience with migrating other businesses and cfe and c2 to bats’ technology platform there are certain portions of our cboe options business such as open outcry trading that have not yet been supported by bats’ technology platform 

we currently expect to complete the migration of cboe options by october 7 2019 however we may not be able to successfully achieve the transition on the timetable currently contemplated and the transition may not be successful have inadequate performance or could encounter various difficulties and unexpected issues any delays trading disruptions or issues that we encounter in the transition could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and could negatively affect our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition as well as impair customer confidence in our product offerings and overall services or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

the technology upon which we rely including those of our service providers may be vulnerable to security risks cybersecurity risks insider threats unauthorized disclosure of confidential information operational disruptions and other risks and events that could harm our business 

the secure and reliable operation of our technology including our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential commercially sensitive or personally identifiable information data theft corruption or destruction cyberattack malware and other security problems as well as acts of terrorism natural disasters human error criminal insider activity power loss and other events that are beyond our control for example in 2018 we discovered and investigated and are continuing to further investigate as of the date of this filing an incident involving a suspected theft of computer servers and networking devices additionally as of the date of this filing we believe that a number of the suspected stolen servers may have contained a limited amount of firmspecific trading data from in or before 2017 but we did not find evidence that the servers or devices contained personally identifiable information we continue to review and enhance our policies procedures and controls around the protection of our computer systems and communications networks to minimize the risk of reoccurrence 

we currently maintain physical technical and administrative safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity availability and reliability of our systems networks and information more broadly and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access we also maintain and continue to enhance measures for tracking and appropriately disposing of technology equipment hardware during technology updates and migrations collectively these safeguards and measures may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents subjecting us to contractual restrictions liability and damages loss of business penalties unfavorable publicity and increased scrutiny by our regulators and materially impacting our financial condition and operating results we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability such harms also could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business financial condition and operating results 

 

additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

the market for trade execution services and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction fees and market data fees thereby adversely affecting our operating results we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation see “business – competition” 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can in addition our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop introduce andor market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products 

furthermore new or existing competitors may 



















if our products markets services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

we depend on thirdparty service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ nscc lch euroccp and six x‑clear securities information processors such as the cta utp securities information processor and opra regulatory and other service providers such as finra nfa occ and thesys the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers and various vendors of communications and networking products and services in addition we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing transactions on our behalf more specifically 



 













with respect to options all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2018 there were 95 tphs that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for approximately 525 of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2018 the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 158 of transaction and other fees collected through occ additionally the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe options c2 bzx edgx and at all of the options exchanges should a clearing member or liquidity provider exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges enact additional marketmaker financial requirements or if marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity this could create a significant disruption to the options markets including ours 

we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements such as moving clearing to another clearing agency in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

our operations outside of the us expose us to currency risk 

in addition to our operations in the us we have operations in the uk continental europe ecuador hong kong and singapore we therefore have exposure to exchange rate movements between the british pound the euro the hong kong dollar and the singapore dollar against the us dollar significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic conditions acts of war or terrorism changes in governmental monetary or tax policy brexit or changes in local interest rates these exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non‑us results of operations and financial condition into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements 

 

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products may suffer 

we are a party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indexes including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 index and sp 100 index sp for the djia lseg for more than two dozen ftse russell indexes including the russell 2000 index and msci inc for six msci indexes including the msci eafe index and msci emerging markets index these license agreements provide that we are authorized to list options on their indexes and some of the resulting index options are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges the quality and integrity of each of these indexes are dependent on the ability of the index providers to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and we are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data to us we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indexes and uses of the indexes that infringe on our licenses furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry and even if we believe that such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees including those experienced with integration of our business our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees we expect to benefit from the integration experience of certain employees who were formerly bats personnel however we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us the roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to advance integration or otherwise pursue business opportunities which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business financial condition and operating results 

additionally certain of our information technology employees will be important to retain during the migration period to effectively manage our technology platforms and to assist in the process of migrating our systems to the bats’ technology platform many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex aspects of cboe command because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other companies if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation also our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles until integration strategies following the merger are executed these circumstances may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel we also must continue to motivate employees and maintain their focus on our strategies and goals doing so may be difficult due to the uncertainty and challenges associated with postmerger integration in addition if these personnel were to leave or we are unable to recruit highly qualified personnel we may experience increased difficulty in the integration process synergy realization maintenance of the current technology platform and may not be able to adequately replace such personnel which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems failures consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we   have historically done 

additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

our business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems if our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform including during migrations from the cboe command platform to the bats technology platform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services these consequences could result in trading outages lower trading volumes financial losses decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup plan of significant trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite having disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all following a systems failure moreover with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

 

our markets have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 











any of these events may cause 









as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

misconduct by our tphs members participants or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs members participants or other persons who use our markets or our products or our employees may engage in fraud market or product manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market or product manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market or product manipulation by or failures of participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges or of our products which could reduce revenues 

our use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re ‑ engineer our software which could harm our business 

the bats technology platform uses open source software code companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software in addition some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated we believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code however if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code re‑engineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action 

 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs and members for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

brexit could have a negative impact on the uk and eu economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted to leave the eu in a referendum the “brexit vote” on march 29 2017 the uk invoked article 50 with its notice to leave the eu the terms and the exact timing of the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” remain unclear although it is unlikely to be completed before march 29 2019 in addition to the economic uncertainty the brexit vote brings there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider 











in 2018 we derived 78 of our total net revenues from our uk operations depending on the outcome of the brexit negotiations companies with operations in the uk may face unfavorable business conditions to access the single market in preparation for brexit cboe europe equities is planning to establish a new venue in amsterdam and has applied to the netherlands authority for the financial markets to become a regulated market in the netherlands the 

 

application is expected to be decided by the end of the first quarter of 2019 cboe europe equities may continue to choose to move some or all of its operations to the eu and the related costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation various issues may give rise to reputational risk including issues relating to 



























damage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our exchanges or cause us to lose customers this in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management and compliance methods are not effective our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit risk and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance audit and risk management personnel these systems and procedures may not be fully effective we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of actual or alleged non‑compliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which may be substantial in the past the sec has brought actions against exchange operators including us for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and operating results and in extreme cases our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events if our policies procedures and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that our 

 

management compliance department enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these functions policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

financial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers clearing agents and counterparties for example we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity operational failure bankruptcy or other reasons 

in addition with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates wedbush securities inc “wedbush” and morgan stanley  co llc “morgan stanley” guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that wedbush or morgan stanley fails to perform with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

with respect to us equities cboe trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to wedbush and morgan stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date cboe trading uses wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of credit suisse securities usa llc as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools morgan stanley clears trades routed through the morgan stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools cboe trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution 

with respect to us listed equity and exchange traded product options cboe trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution 

our exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers and other third parties to satisfy their contractual obligations to us moreover we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

while neither cboe fx nor cboe sef has direct counterparty risk cboe fx or cboe sef may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx and cboe sef may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot fx on the cboe fx platform or nondeliverable forward fx transactions on cboe sef 

we may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service which could subject us to trading losses when our brokerdealer disposes of that position 

we offer a smart‑order routing service through our broker‑dealer subsidiary cboe trading which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution in connection with this service we may assume ownership of a position in securities this may occur for example when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systems problems and is unable to determine the status of that order when this happens we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order we may be informed later however that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it in which case cboe trading would be required to take 

 

ownership of that securities position our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of cboe trading into which such positions settle and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible which could result in our incurring trading losses 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we have experienced increased volume on our futures exchange extended trading hours on our futures exchange and in spx and vix options and developed several proprietary products we also experienced a substantial expansion of our business following our acquisition of bats which significantly expanded our product line across asset classes broadened our geographic reach with strong paneuropean equities and global fx positions and diversified our business mix with significant nontransactional revenue streams bats has also experienced significant growth in its business since its inception in 2005 with material expansions into diverse businesses including european listed cash equity securities us listed equity options and global institutional spot fx trading 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed furthermore failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our business financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe or cboe sef the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays including because of a government shutdown or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe global markets the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income if this occurs we may experience a higher effective tax rate 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration such as integrating our business with bats’ business may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be required to inject further capital into occ or euroccp or return dividends received back to occ 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges in addition cboe europe owns 20 of euroccp which is one of three interoperable central counterparties used to clear trades conducted on cboe europe under occs capital plan each of occs existing exchange stockholders which include cboe options agreed to provide its pro rata share in replenishment capital up to a maximum of 40 million per exchange stockholder if certain capital thresholds are breached however as discussed in additional detail in note 7 “investments” the occ capital plan has been disapproved by the sec and due to the recency there is uncertainty regarding next steps and potential consequences if the occ capital plan is unwound as a result of this disapproval we may be required to return dividend payments received from occ which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results although the sec’s disapproval of the occ capital plan may affect cboe options’ 40 million replenishment capital commitment described above given occ’s importance to cboe options’ business if occ were to experience financial difficulties cboe options might nevertheless be required to inject further capital into it in order to maintain its working or regulatory capital likewise if euroccp were to experience financial difficulties cboe europe might be required to inject further capital into it in order to maintain its working or regulatory capital in a worst case scenario occ or euroccp as applicable might have their regulatory license suspended or withdrawn or might have to wind down this may result in a loss to cboe options and cboe europe of their respective investments in occ and euroccp and withdrawals of occ or euroccp as clearing houses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

we have outstanding indebtedness which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as of december 31 2018 we had 275 million outstanding under our term loan facility 950 million of senior unsecured notes and no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our increased indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions our increased indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements we are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes further a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

as of december 31 2018 we have investment grade credit ratings from sp global ratings a and moody’s investor service a3 ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs could increase 

if our goodwill investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired the resulting charge to earnings may be significant 

we are required to assess investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill intangible assets or investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe global markets depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its 

 

subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may negatively affect the valuation of our common stock 

our business could experience seasonal fluctuations reflecting reduced trading activity generally during the third quarter of each year and during the last month of each year as a result it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors if this happens the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 













furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors 

we indirectly hold 100 of the issued share capital and voting rights in cboe europe and its wholly owned subsidiary cboe chix europe as a result any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock is subject to certain regulatory requirements under uk law 

a person that indirectly acquires control in a fca entity is required to file a change in control notice with the fca though both are fca regulated entities the statutorily prescribed change in control notification threshold for cboe europe is acquisition of voting power with respect to 20 or more of the issued share capital thereof the change in control notification threshold for cboe chix europe is acquisition of voting power with respect to 10 or more of the issued share capital thereof therefore any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be required to file a change in control notice in respect of cboe chix europe and if this holding is in excess of 20 also for cboe europe this obligation may discourage delay or prevent accumulations of 10 or more of our common stock

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 

 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions of bats vest silexx and livevol resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350— intangibles—goodwill and other  we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using the october 1 carrying values goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with asc 35020 if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess if the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is less than their carrying value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2018 and determined that no impairment existed 

the estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach using discounted estimated future cash flows the estimated fair values of indefinitelived intangibles used the income approach the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgment including judgments about the d iscount rate anticipated revenue growth rate and operating expenses that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period as such actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if updated estimates indicate that the fair value o f goodwill or any indefinitelived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate 

purchase accounting 

tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense when available the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices information from comparable transactions offers made by other prospective acquirers in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness level 1 and 2 unobservable inputs such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value level 3 are used if observable inputs are not available as noted in asc 805 business combinations  the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to twelve months after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition   see note 5 for additional information 

 

stockbased compensation 

we have historically granted stockbased compensation to our employees in the form of restricted stock units with the acquisition of bats we also assumed bats’ grants of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees we record the related compensation expense based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by fasb we recognize these compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model stockbased compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock is based on the fair value at the grant date we recognized compensation expense of approximately 351 million 501 million and 145 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively this expense is included in the compensation and benefits expense and acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of income assumptions used to estimate compensation expense are determined as follows 









income taxes 

deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in our opinion it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 

foreign currency 

the functional currency of cboe europe and certain cboe fx operations is the british pound certain cboe fx operations also use the singapore dollar and hong kong dollar as functional currency trades on our european equities exchange are denominated in euros british pounds and other european currencies billing for trading revenues are primarily billed in british pounds but customers may elect to be billed in the currency traded including euros swiss francs norwegian kroners swedish kronas and danish kroners the assets and liabilities of cboe europe and certain cboe fx operations are translated from british pounds singapore dollars and hong kong dollars into us dollars using the relevant exchange rate in effect as of each balance sheet date statements of income and cash flow amounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period the cumulative effects of translating the balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the us dollar at the applicable exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and have historically not been material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk equity risk credit risk and interest rate risk we have implemented policies and procedures to measure manage and monitor and report risk exposures which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a result of the acquisition of bats we expanded our operations in europe and asia and are subject to currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound singapore dollar hong kong dollar and the euro we also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies including the swiss franc norwegian kroner swedish krona and danish kroner 

for the year ended december 31 2018 our exposure to foreigndenominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table 





equity risk 

our investment in european operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to us dollars the assets and liabilities of our european business are denominated in british pounds fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of these nonus dollar statements of financial condition into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

our primary exposure to this equity risk as of december 31 2018 is presented by foreign currency in the following table 





 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers counterparties and clearing agents these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we limit our exposure to credit risk by selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the us and europe with respect to listed cash equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the nscc without taking on counterparty risk for those trades nscc acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on bzx byx edgx and edga and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms morgan stanley  co llc morgan stanley or wedbush securities inc wedbush securities morgan stanley and wedbush securities guarantee trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that morgan stanley or wedbush securities fails we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees 

historically we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in marketwide credit difficulties or other market disruptions 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot fx trades occurring on our platform because cboe fx is not a counterparty to any fx transactions all transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade while cboe fx does not have direct counterparty risk cboe fx may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade fx on the cboe fx platform 

we also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheet our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets 

on a regular basis we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations any such effects to date have been minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents financial investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2018 and 2017 our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were 3108 million and 1908 million respectively of which 729 and 449 million is held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries in 2018 and 2017 respectively  the remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes due to the nature of these investments we have not been exposed to nor do we 

 

anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments 

as of december 31 2018 we had 1225 billion in outstanding debt of which 950 million relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixedrate obligations the remaining amount outstanding of 2750 million relates to the term loan agreement which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement as of december 31 2018 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 28 million assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as this facility bears interest at fluctuating rates as of december 31 2018 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement see note 13 debt to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements

our business 

cboe options was founded in 1973 as a nonstock corporation owned by its members cboe options was the first organized marketplace for the trading of standardized exchangetraded options on equity securities in 2004 cfe began operations as a futures exchange cboe global markets was incorporated in the state of delaware on august 15 2006 in june 2010 cboe options demutualized cboe options cfe and c2 became whollyowned subsidiaries of cboe global markets and cboe global markets completed its initial public offering in october 2010 c2 initiated operations as described in further detail below on february 28 2017 the company completed the acquisition of bats following the acquisition on october 16 2017 we changed our legal name from cboe holdings inc to cboe global markets inc 

on february 28 2017 pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 25 2016 the “merger agreement” by and among cboe global markets  bats cboe corporation a delaware corporation and a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe “merger sub” and cboe bats llc formerly cboe v llc a delaware limited liability company and a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe “merger llc” cboe completed the merger of merger sub with and into bats and the subsequent merger the “subsequent merger” of bats with and into merger llc as a result of the merger bats became a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe in connection with the merger the company issued approximately 30 million shares of cboe global markets common stock and paid approximately 956 million in cash the company entered into a term loan agreement and completed a notes offering as described below securing 165 billion to finance the cash portion of its acquisition of bats as well as the repayment of bats’ existing indebtedness

proprietary products 

in addition to our exchanges providing a marketplace and listing venue for the trading of securities and derivatives that meet criteria established in the rules of their respective exchanges we also offer trading in products and licenses based on our own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility index products based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the sp 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks such as the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and the cboe sp 500 smile index and options strategy benchmarks such as buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and russell 2000 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes o ur most frequently traded products are spx options and vix options and futures in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indexes we have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense certain indexes we generate revenue from both the calculation and dissemination of index values and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes including on an exclusive basis as the foundation for indexes index options and other products the company also acquires interests in and forms partnerships with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following 

 













spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indexes and is considered a bellwether for the us economy the options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of its status as a bellwether spx is traded in a number of different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices we also offer spx weeklys options which we believe that traders are using to fine tune the timing of hedging strategies and maximize the risk premium in strategies that involve the sale of options such as covered call writing 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the volatility trading space with its introduction of futures on the vix index in 2004 and options on the vix index in 2006 the vix index is based on realtime prices of options on the sp 500 index and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging 

 

extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorter term 

trading volumes in options and futures on the vix index may be especially sensitive to market volatility with increases in volume generally occurring along with spikes in volatility while we believe that there will be continued intrinsic growth in our volatility products significant changes in the levels of market volatility may significantly impact volumes in these products 

in addition to the vix index we offer other products based on the vix methodology including futures on cboe russell 2000 volatility index and the cboecbot 10year us treasury note volatility index cfe also lists futures on realized variance while volumes in our nonvix futures volatility products are not material to us we continue to explore opportunities to expand our volatility product offerings with respect to both new indexes and new asset classes 

listing 

bzx and cboe europe equities serve as listing destinations for etps in 2017 cboe etf marketplace a market specifically structured and designed for etp issuers and their investors added 89 listings and won 32 percent of all new us etp listings there are now 230 etps globally listed on cboe etf marketplace from 44 different issuers we offer fully‑automated opening closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process 

both bzx and cboe europe equities also offer issuers the choice of a more traditional market maker program referred to as the cboe lead market maker “lmm” program on bzx and the cboe europe equities liquidity provider program “lpp” on cboe europe equities an lmm has certain quoting obligations and bzx pays the lmm an enhanced rebate for executions against its displayed orders in the issuer’s security and charges a reduced fee when the lmm executes against other orders in the issuer’s security on the bzx book under the lpp cboe europe equities offers three programs designed for participants that wish to provide liquidity by posting and maintaining executable quotes within certain set parameters with the result of providing liquidity on a regular and ongoing basis bzx also offers the cboe liquidity management provider “lmp” program “lmp program” the lmp program is a rewardsbased program that incentivizes liquidity providers to make a better market in etfs incentives are based on an lmp’s quote quality in the cboe lmp securities which include all cboelisted etps and certain noncboelisted etps cboe europe equities also offers a competitive liquidity program “clp program” which is a rebate based scheme designed to encourage quoting activity the clp program is a supplemental rewards based program designed to encourage quoting competition among market makers in securities listed on cboe europe equities  the clp program is funded by the issuer 

market data 

we derive a portion of our revenue from market data fees from us tape plans including utp opra and the consolidated tape association “cta” which includes the consolidated quotation system “cqs” fees net of plan costs from utp cta and cqs are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula required by regulation nms which takes into account both trading and quoting activity 

we also provide a robust offering of market data products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs products include realtime depth of book quotation information auction and complex option information top of book quotes and trades last sale information consolidated equity feeds realtime index values and trade reporting facility information we also provide analytics services and historical information for our markets through multiple data services 

our models 

to meet various market demands we utilize a variety of market and pricing models cboe options utilizes various models 

 

in different listed options classes with different combinations of customer priority participation rights and prorata modified prorata or pricetime priority depending on the product we have adopted a prorata model on listed equity options trading on c2 and edgx cboe options and edgx utilize a “classic” pricing model that charges a fee to market makers and a portion of that fee is then provided back to customers’ brokers known as payment for order flow the classic pricing model also provides customers with rebates and volume incentive programs and charges fees to noncustomers in our proprietary products we assess transaction fees on all participants with the amount of the fee based on the market participant’s role and the origin of the underlying order and subject to discounts based on relative volume or trading strategies 

cfe utilizes a pricetime priority model for vix futures and clients are charged transaction fees that vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s central limit order book or is a block trade cfe also offers incentive programs for certain products that provide rebates on trades that qualify for the respective programs 

we have adopted a pricetime priority model and “makertaker” “takermaker” and “feefee” pricing models in certain of our markets under our “makertaker” pricing model on bzx for both listed cash equity securities and listed equity options edgx for listed cash equity securities and c2 options a customer posting an order on our book the “liquidity maker” is paid a rebate for an execution occurring against that order and a customer executing against an order resting on our book the “liquidity taker” is charged a fee we generate a substantial portion of our operating income from the difference between the “maker” rebate and the “taker” fee although customers must pay a fee to access that liquidity that fee is explicitly disclosed and charged to all customers on a nondiscriminatory basis conversely the byx listed cash equity securities “takermaker” pricing model provides that a liquidity taker will be paid a rebate and the liquidity maker will be charged a fee historically the takermaker fees and rebates have been significantly less than the makertaker rebates and fees finally the edga “feefee” pricing model provides that a low fee is assessed for both the liquidity maker and liquidity provider 

the cboe fx platform uses a price‑firmnesstime priority model and clients are charged either a flat or tiered commission rate based upon the notional amount traded on the platform 

our exchanges also charge fees for the opportunity to trade or access to our exchanges including fees for tradingrelated functionality to facilitate trading we also charge fees for certain technology services terminal and other equipment rights maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services 

customers 

our customers include financial institutions institutional and individual investors and professional traders our equities and options customers in the united states include trading permit holders and members of cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga which are sec‑registered broker‑dealers and the clients of those broker‑dealers our futures customers include banks futures commission merchants hedge funds asset managers proprietary trading firms and commodity trading advisors similarly our equities’ customers in europe are european union “eu” regulated brokerage and proprietary trading firms as well as sponsored access clients of these brokerage firms and certain noneu regulated and unregulated direct access participants our institutional spot fx customers include banks broker‑dealers hedge funds asset managers proprietary trading firms commodity trading advisors and corporates access to our markets trading rights and privileges depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a trading permit holder trading privilege holder member or participant of one of our markets 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is intensely competitive we believe we face competition on a number of factors including 



 











we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods including 















in our proprietary products we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products such as options on spy which offer some of the market exposure of our proprietary products such as options on spx 

the multiplylisted options industry is extremely competitive we expect this trend to continue the number of us options exchanges that we compete with has significantly increased to 11 exchanges as of december 31 2017 in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other options exchanges in addition the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multiplylisted options business to their exchanges which has reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multiplylisted options and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers to increase their volume traded 

our us listed cash equity securities and listing services compete against national exchanges regional exchanges and several alternative trading systems “atss” market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders including national securities exchanges and numerous off‑exchange venues including atss operating “dark pools” that do not publicly display quotations “lit” atss that publicly display quotations operating as electronic communication networks and broker‑dealers who internalize orders off‑exchange additionally issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products including other national and regional exchanges 

the market for execution services in europe has become significantly more competitive following the introduction of the markets in financial instruments directive directive 200439ec “mifid” we expect that competition in paneuropean trading will continue to increase in the near term though the directive on markets in financial instruments directive 201465eu repealing directive 200439ec “mifid ii” and the regulation on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 6002014 “mifir” place more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restrict certain types of trading activity n ew mtfs emerged that have captured significant market share from existing national exchanges our major competitors in europe include 15 other equities exchanges as of december 31 2017 

the spot fx market remains severely fragmented with transparent automated marketplaces such as cboe fx challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors while the spot fx market recently has been experiencing a shift from competing interbank platforms to ecns the electronification of spot fx may encounter resistance from clients that still prefer 

 

to utilize the phone instant chats terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading furthermore electronification of fx appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the united states the electronic spot fx market is also intensely competitive with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of december 31 2017 

in addition demand for our market data faces competition from other securities exchanges t echnology companies thirdparty market data providers and information and software vendors who have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges the sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from atss and trading venues that offer similar products distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products 

technology 

cboe trading technology 

cboe currently operates two distinct technology platforms for its equity options and futures markets cboe command and the bats technology platform cboe options c2 and cfe are currently operating on cboe command bzx byx edga edgx and cboe europe equities all operate on the bats platform we plan to utilize bats’ leading proprietary technology by migrating trading on cboe options c2 and cfe onto bats’ trading platform cfe’s migration to bats’ trading platform is expect to be completed on february 25 2018 and c2 is expected to be migrated on may 14 2018 until the migrations are completed cboe options c2 and cfe are expected to be operated on cboe command in addition cboe operates a separate fx trading platform for global fx 

both of our trading platforms are developed owned and operated inhouse and are designed to optimize reliability speed scalability and versatility each of our exchanges provide different market models appealing to different user bases and the trading technologies support all of them further the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets including dark books trade reporting facility systematic internalizer largeinscale smart order routing flex options 24x5 trading and hybrid trading combining electronic and open outcry 

our trading platforms have experienced very low operational downtime and low latency the trading platforms use readily available hardware thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry also in order to continue to implement new enhancements to the bats technology platforms new releases of software are deployed multiple times per month and deployed simultaneously in all of the applicable markets 

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we believe that our recovery time in the event of an outage is comparable to or better than that of our competitors we regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our backup data centers as well as an annual test with our us trading participants in europe we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our backup data center as well as an annual test with our european trading participants we continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities 

 

routing and clearing 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges national securities clearing corporation “nscc” is the sole provider of clearing on our us listed cash equity exchanges cboe europe equities relies on lchclearnet group limited “lch” euroccp nv a dutch domiciled clearing house “euroccp” and six x‑clear ltd “six xclear” to clear trades in european listed equity securities as part of an interoperable clearing model 

cboe trading is a routing brokerdealer used by our four us equity exchanges and our bzx and edgx exchanges for options in europe cboe europe equities uses our brokerdealer cboe chix europe and is one of the few market centers in europe that provides such routing services to its customers 

regulatory environment and compliance 

we are subject to regulation by the sec ctfc finra and fca and market participants may be subject to regulation by the sec cftc finra fca board of governors of the federal reserve us department of the treasury andor our foreign regulators the following is a discussion of the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec the cftc and certain european regulators 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems new products competition or at the request of market participants in particular both the sec and cftc are under new leadership as part of the transition to the trump administration which adds additional uncertainty to the regulatory environment the following is a summary of the general regulatory structure and brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business 

united states 

automated trading 

in november 2015 the cftc issued a rulemaking proposal relating to automated trading on dcms referred to as regulation automated trading regulation at in november 2016 the cftc issued a supplemental rulemaking proposal which included modifications to the original proposal the rulemaking proposal proposes risk control and other requirements for a certain market participants that are defined as “at persons” b executing futures commission merchants fcms and c dcms 

regulation at requires the implementation of risk controls such as maximum order message and maximum order size parameters and the establishment of standards for the development testing and monitoring of automated trading systems among other requirements automated trading persons at persons and executing fcms would be required to submit annual certifications to dcms attesting to their compliance with regulation at and dcms would be required to establish programs for the periodic review and evaluation of compliance with regulation at by at persons and executing fcms regulation at also proposes to require the registration of certain proprietary traders and to require that these at persons become members of a registered futures association 

although cfe may require additional resources to comply with the proposal if it were to be adopted by the cftc cfe does not expect that the proposal will have a material impact on cfe or its operations

the emsac considered issues relating to regulation nms the regulation of trading venues including exchanges and atss customer issues and market quality in its public meetings the emsac heard presentations and debated issues associated with the continued viability of the order protection rule or rule 611 of regulation nms the merits of reducing the access fee cap in rule 610 of regulation nms or banning the payment of rebates as well as the merits of implementation of a so‑called “trade‑at” rule which would generally constrain the ability of over‑the‑counter trading venues such as dark pools from transacting otc or off‑exchange unless the execution price is better than that being publicly displayed on exchanges the us equity market volatility events of august 24 2015 and other issues affecting customers in the current us equity market structure the emsac was part of a broader review of equity market structure undertaken by the sec the emsac made policy recommendations to the sec such as recommending that the sec propose a pilot program to adjust the access fee cap under rule 610 of regulation nms the sec is not bound by these recommendations and has yet to proceed with rule‑making associated with the recommendations we cannot predict or estimate the extent to which these regulations may affect us or our operations  

fx global code 

in may 2017 a set of global principles of good practice the “global code” was published to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange market although the global code does not impose legal or regulatory obligations on market participants it is intended to supplement local laws rules and regulation by identifying good practices and processes the global code was developed by a partnership between central banks and market participants from 16 jurisdictions around the world the publication of the global code impacts our global fx business which has supported its development throughout the negotiation process and which has formally adhered to its principles as of september 2017 following the review and enhancement of its business practices the global fx business will continue to be engaged with its membership and with the broader fx market as the effects of the publication of the global code continue to develop

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

 

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our exchange operations are subject to the sec’s oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including record keeping and the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros the exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations for example on june 11 2013 cboe options and c2 entered into a consent order with the sec under which cboe options and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are also required to certify until 2019 in addition on january 12 2015 edgx and edga entered into a consent order with the sec under which edgx and edga were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid a fine of 14 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings we have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are also required to certify until 2018 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and the exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees to cover section 31 fees charged to the exchanges by the sec and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of section 31 fess to the sec additionally under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of the exchanges’ rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation bylaws or other governing documents of the sros or their parent companies the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

futures and swaps industrycfe and cboe sef 

the operations of each of cfe and cboe sef are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange and in some cases requires swaps trading to be conducted on swap execution facilities the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap 

 

execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of a specified futures or swaps contracts is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market and cboe sef is a swap execution facility each of which is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act as a designated contract market cfe is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the commodity exchange act as is cboe sef as a swap execution facility each of cfe and cboe sef has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules and by participants with sef rules as applicable if cfe or cboe sef fails to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations it may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of its business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of cfe’s designation as a contract market or cboe sef’s designation as a swap execution facility 

europe 

our european stock exchange cboe europe equities  is located in london and subject to regulation in the united kingdom and to certain european regulations the current united kingdom regulatory system was established by the financial services act 2012 “fsa12” which amended the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” the legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator the financial services authority with three new bodies the financial policy committee “fpc” the prudential regulation authority “pra” and the fca the fpc is a committee of the bank of england and sets policy for financial regulation it is made up of the governor and other senior figures within the bank along with the chief executives of the pra and fca and senior industry figures the pra is responsible for the prudential regulation of banks insurance companies and other systemically important institutions financial conduct of markets including activity on and the operation of markets is regulated by the fca which is an independent non‑governmental body given statutory powers by the fsa12 the fca has three statutory objectives to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services the fca is accountable to her majesty’s treasury ministers and through them to parliament 

fsma as amended by fsa12 governs the regulation of financial services and markets in the uk under section 19 of fsma any person who carries on a regulated activity in the uk must be authorized by the appropriate authority or exempt recognised bodies which include exchanges and clearing houses are exempt breach of section 19 may be a criminal offense and punishable on indictment by a maximum term of two years imprisonment andor a fine the fsma regulated activities order 2001 which is secondary legislation under fsma details regulated activities and specified investments 

once a firm is authorized or recognized by the fca it is required to meet the standards set out in its handbook of rules and guidance and to supply the fca with information so that the fca can monitor the firm’s business the fca supervises the firm according to the risks that it poses to the fca’s statutory objectives 

much of the uk financial services regulation originates in the european union on november 1 2007 mifid which replaced the investment services directive came into force and was implemented by eea member states mifid aims to harmonize european financial services businesses by setting out provisions governing organizational and conduct of business requirements that apply to firms and the requirements applicable to rms for example stock 

 

exchanges and mtfs mifid also aims to facilitate cross‑border business by extending the concept of “passporting” which allows firms authorized to carry on business in one eea member state to carry on business in other eea member states 

as an rie that operates both an rm and an mtf cboe europe equities is required to comply with the relevant uk requirements as set out in the fca handbook including where applicable relevant european directives and regulations as implemented or which apply directly in the uk these requirements include organizational requirements capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for rms and mtfs mifid sets out requirements for rms and mtfs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non‑discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on rms and mtfs and monitoring compliance with the rules the regulatory functions required of cboe europe equities by mifid are performed by in‑house staff cboe europe equities utilizes the same state‑of‑the‑art real‑time surveillance system that we use to monitor trading and market activities on bzx byx edga and edgx 

the onward routing service offered by cboe europe equities is performed by cboe chi‑x europe which is authorized as an investment firm with agency broker permissions 

mifid has been updated and the new legislation known as mifid ii and mifir was implemented january 3 2018 and generally tightens the requirements placed on both exchanges and investment firms in particular use of certain waivers from pre‑trade transparency are capped as a percentage of total market volume and a general trading obligation requires almost all equity trades to be conducted on a duly registered trading venue furthermore mifid ii and mifir extend mandatory transparency requirements to non‑equity markets such as fixed income 

global fx 

while the global institutional spot fx market remains largely unregulated the enactment of the dodd‑frank act and its related regulations in the united states and the ongoing implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products for example certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as an sef or dcm in the united states or on an mtf or otf in europe moreover this movement is highlighted by the recent publication of the global code which may lead to additional oversight and regulation in the global fx market

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business and relating to the merger these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity cash flows and the merger 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indexes and based on which we have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2017 approximately 698 of our net transaction fees defined below were generated by futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products and products based on the vix methodology the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our sp 500 index options and vix index options and futures as a result our operating revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the eu has adopted legislation commonly referred to as mifir that will require the person with proprietary rights to a benchmark to provide nondiscriminatory access to that benchmark to trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing licenses to the benchmark must be provided on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms in addition the eu implemented at the beginning of 2018 legislation known as the benchmark regulation that may impact the ability of european investors to trade our us benchmark products if they are not recognized authorized endorsed or deemed equivalent in the eu while similar legislation to mifir has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose exclusivity in our internally developed and licensed index products the new european legislation may impact our expansion activities of our us benchmark products in europe and may reduce the volume on our us options and futures exchanges from international customers 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of exchange transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

































 





any of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading volumes and demand for market data 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations “sros” and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a designated contract market “dcm” and cboe sef is a swap execution facility “sef” each registered with the cftc and subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc in addition to its other sro responsibilities bzx as a listing market also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on bzx and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with bzx’s continued listing standards failure to comply with these sro responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on cboe’s reputation or branding 

our european business is subject to regulatory oversight in the uk by the uk financial conduct authority “fca” which through the “passporting” regime provides authorization to carry on business in other member states of the eu and the european economic area in accordance with the applicable eu legislation and regulation to which our european business is subject if a regulatory authority makes a finding of non‑compliance conditional fines could be imposed and our licenses could be revoked any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our us markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs and members that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options and equities exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our tphs and members 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by as applicable sros dcms and sefs pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient our sros dcm or sef could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange dcm or sef any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition our sros dcm or sef may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate for example if we are unable to fulfill 

 

our obligations under the consent orders with the sec with respect to cboe options and c2 or with respect to bzx byx edgx and edga it may have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition sros are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions in light of those responsibilities courts have held that sros are immune from damages for some civil claims related to actions that are incident to their regulatory responsibilities there is a risk that a court might not adopt the immunity doctrine and whether a court that recognizes the doctrine would apply it to a claim depends on the nature of the claim in addition we could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the securities industry is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees we may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors which could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results we also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and valueadded market data such as historical market data 

in our options segment the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete on price against certain multiplylisted options products including spy which offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

to attract market share we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or no‑transaction fee trading from time to time for example our electronic trading platform for institutional spot fx has at times offered trading of spot gold and silver pairs without any transaction fee or waived fees for certain transactions bzx also offers a “cross‑asset add volume tier” that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the bzx equities and options platforms these forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive 

 

pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2017 approximately 702 of our operating revenues were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges cfe or notional value traded on cboe fx and cboe europe equities exchanges decreases we will lose transaction fees revenue from our spot fx business is influenced by the general level of trading activity in the spot fx market trading volume on our exchanges and markets can be influenced by a number of factors including market volatility 

our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 















over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including basel iii doddfrank the collins amendment to doddfrank mifid ii and mifir may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

our market data fees and revenues may be reduced due to declines in our market share trading volumes or regulatory changes 

the occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive whether as a result of fee reductions fewer members subscribing to the us tape plans declines in market share or trading volumes or notional volume in the case of cboe europe equities or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results for example if our market share of us listed cash equities and options or cboe’s european cash equities trading were to decline our share of market data fees could also decline moreover market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise 

 

regulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data or our cost in providing such services in the us we are generally required to file with the sec any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products in recent years certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products specifically the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” has filed a number of denial of access applications with the sec to set aside proposed rule changes to establish or modify fees for our market data products and related services an adverse ruling in these matters could cause the sec to more closely examine exchange market data fees which in turn could result in our having to reduce the fees we charge for market data and there could be a negative impact on our revenues see note 23 “commitments contingencies and guarantees—legal proceedings” for more information 

we believe cboe europe equities currently offers market data to customers on a non‑discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost as regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our european market data revenues while mifid ii and mifir aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in europe should this fail to materialize policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc fca foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and futures industries we have also experienced an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation that impact our markets or require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret implement or alter these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to additional costs we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them 

under the collins amendment to the doddfrank act starting in 2015 large us banks were required to use a new approach to compute their risk weighted assets which include exchangetraded options and futures this and other rulemaking has led to further increases in capital requirements for us bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives these increased capital requirements which in many cases overstate the true economic exposure associated with listed options may reduce trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated clearing members and brokerdealers reducing their own trading charging their customers more to trade reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of marketmaker clearing 

further congress regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading the structure of equity markets and high frequency trading in recent years the sec continues to consider various potential market structure changes which could result in reduced trading volumes or which could negatively affect our business to the extent the sec adopts regulatory changes our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted in addition the continued growth of high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and regulatory enforcement actions alleging that high frequency trading firms have received unfair advantages at the expense of other traders high frequency trading accounts for a meaningful percentage of the daily volume in the us and 

 

european equity markets and these actions and other efforts to slow trading could lead to a reduction in trading volumes negatively impacting all trading markets including our business 

in addition the sec approved a two‑year “tick pilot” program to impose wider minimum quoting andor trading increments or tick sizes in certain securities in an effort to incentivize liquidity provision in those securities the tick pilot began on october 3 2016 and consists of a control group of approximately 1400 securities the equity exchanges including bzx byx edgx and edga and finra are required to submit their initial assessments on the tick pilot’s impact 18 months after the pilot begins based on data generated during the first 12 months of its operation the tick pilot has added complexity to the exchange system increasing our software development costs in addition for tick pilot test group securities where execution at price increments narrower than the permitted quote is permitted the implementation of the tick pilot could incentivize additional trading away from the exchanges reducing the volume of orders executed on bzx byx edgx and edga 

under eu regulations european banks and other european financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu however the occ is working with the eu to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent as a prerequisite to becoming qualified occ could be required by the eu to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default this capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of nondefaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted occ’s stockholders including cboe options could be required to fund this capital if the eu does not recognize occ as a qualified clearinghouse by june 15 2018 or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended then european market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

mifid came into effect in 2007 regulating the market for execution services within european listed cash equity securities mifid has been superseded and enhanced by mifid ii and mifir which were implemented at the beginning of 2018 the implementation of mifid ii and mifir in europe will result in an alteration of the existing mifid structure that has encouraged competition among market centers in europe mifid ii and mifir introduce a number of new rules including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements which apply directly to european trading venues such as our mtf and rm the impact of mifid ii and mifir is likely to be significant and could reduce trading volumes and trading fees while increasing our costs of operating in europe 

the legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot fx market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot fx industry spot fx market participants have seen an increasing number of law enforcement actions and regulatory inquiries into their business practices the governmental bodies and regulatory organizations that regulate parts of the spot fx market have enacted proposed and may consider additional legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these entities or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements may also adversely affect our spot fx business further our fx swaps business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities 

in addition although the global code does not impose legislative or regulatory obligations on market participants 

 

following its publication in may 2017 our spot fx business has conducted a review of its business practices in order to formally affirm its adherence to its principles and may be subject to commercial pressures to accommodate its clients’ demands in terms of developments resulting from the global code’s publication 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses that we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time such as the impact of the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” that replaces the data protection directive 9546ec actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us or europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business 

in addition us and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our exchanges and markets 

the brexit vote could have a negative impact on the uk and eu economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted to leave the eu in a referendum the “brexit vote” on march 29 2017 the uk invoked article 50 with its notice to leave the eu the terms and the exact timing of the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” remain unclear although it is unlikely to be completed before the end of march 2019 in addition to the economic uncertainty the brexit vote brings there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider 







 





intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

the market for trade execution services and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction fees and market data fees thereby adversely affecting our operating results we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation see “business – competition” 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can in addition our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop introduce andor market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products 

furthermore new or existing competitors may 



















 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

further consolidation and alliances among our competitors could impair our competitive position 

in recent years the securities trading industry has witnessed increased consolidation among market participants such as bats’ acquisition of direct edge holdings llc in january 2014 and our own acquisition of bats in february 2017 additional consolidations and alliances among market participants may create larger internal liquidity pools that may attract trading volume and liquidity away from our exchanges and therefore lead to decreased revenues in addition consolidations or alliances among our current competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow our competitors to offer lower prices or better customer service than we do these post‑merger competitors may be able to achieve efficiencies that allow them to offer lower transaction fees or other financial incentives which may hinder our ability to stay competitive in listed cash equity securities options futures and spot fx in addition these mergers may result in stronger competitors than the premerger entities as stand‑alone businesses in other markets that we may decide to enter 

we depend on thirdparty service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption significant increase in fees or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ nscc lch euroccp and six x‑clear securities information processors such as the cta utp securities information processor and opra regulatory and other service providers such as finra nfa occ and thesys the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers and various vendors of communications and networking products and services in addition we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing transactions on our behalf more specifically 











 





with respect to options all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2017 there were ninety seven tphs that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for approximately 451 of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2017 the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 14 of transaction and other fees collected through occ additionally the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe options c2 and at all of the options exchanges should a clearing member or liquidity provider withdraw from our options exchanges enact additional marketmakers requirements or marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity this could create a significant disruption to the options markets including ours 

we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services or make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products may suffer 

we are a party to an increasing number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indexes including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 index and sp 100 index sp for the djia lseg for more than two dozen ftse russell indexes including the russell 2000 index and msci inc for six msci indexes including the msci eafe index and msci emerging markets index these license agreements provide that we are authorized to list options on their indexes and some of the resulting index options are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges the quality and integrity of each of these indexes are dependent on the ability of the index providers to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and we are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data to us we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indexes and uses of the indexes that infringe on our licenses furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of 

 

exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry and even if we believe that such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees including those experienced with integration of our business our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees we expect to benefit from the integration experience of certain employees who were formerly bats personnel however we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us the roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to advance integration or otherwise pursue business opportunities which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business financial condition and operating results 

additionally certain of our information technology employees will be important to retain during the migration period to effectively manage our technology platforms and to assist in the process of migrating our systems to the bats’ technology platform many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex aspects of cboe command because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other companies if they 

 

chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation also our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles until integration strategies following the merger are executed these circumstances may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel we also must continue to motivate employees and maintain their focus on our strategies and goals doing so may be difficult due to the uncertainty and challenges associated with postmerger integration in addition if these personnel were to leave or we are unable to recruit highly qualified personnel we may experience increased difficulty in the integration process synergy realization maintenance of the current technology platform and may not be able to adequately replace such personnel which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems failures consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we   have historically done 

additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

our business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems if our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform including during migrations from the cboe command platform to the bats technology platform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services these consequences could result in trading outages lower trading volumes financial losses decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup plan of significant trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite having disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all following a systems failure moreover with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

bats’ markets have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and we could experience future systems failures and delays for example serious technical failures forced bats to cancel its initial public offering and played a role in the halting of another issuer’s stock for five minutes bats has since remedied the failures but there can be no guarantee that we will not suffer a similar technological failure in the future that damages our reputation and results in increased regulatory scrutiny by the sec and other governmental authorities 

more specifically our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing including one or more of the following 



 









any of these events may cause 









as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely including those of our service providers may be vulnerable to security risks cyberattack or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and other disruptions that could harm our business 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems our communications networks and the systems of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access including the improper access or disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information malware and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters human error power loss and other events that are beyond our control our treatment of confidential information may also be subject to contractual restrictions although we currently maintain and expect to maintain security measures designed to protect the integrity of our systems and to protect against unauthorized access such security measures systems and facilities may prove inadequate if our security measures are inadequate or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks we may be subject to contractual liability and damages loss of business penalties unfavorable publicity and our financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches and to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and may suffer harm to our reputation and litigation measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the confidentiality integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

our use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re ‑ engineer our software which could harm our business 

the bats technology platform uses open source software code companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software in addition some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated we believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code however if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code re‑engineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs and members for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation various issues may give rise to reputational risk including issues relating to 

























 



damage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume on our exchanges or cause us to lose customers this in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management and compliance methods are not effective our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit risk and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance audit and risk management personnel these systems and procedures may not be fully effective we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of actual or alleged non‑compliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which may be substantial in the past the sec has brought actions against exchange operators including us for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and operating results and in extreme cases our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events if our policies procedures and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that our management compliance department enterprise risk management committee and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these functions policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

as one of the worlds largest exchange holding companies we may be at a greater risk for a cyberattack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyberattacks is increasing in general and a variety of threat actors have specifically targeted the financial services industry at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any material cases of data theft corruption or destruction of data or compromised customer data however there is no assurance that this will remain the case security breaches may lead to increased scrutiny by our regulators and have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor our network environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

misconduct by our tphs members participants or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs members participants or other persons who use our markets or our products or our employees may engage in fraud market or product manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory 

 

sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market or product manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market or product manipulation by or failures of participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges or of our products which could reduce revenues 

financial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers clearing agents and counterparties for example we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity operational failure bankruptcy or other reasons 

in addition with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms who are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates wedbush securities inc “wedbush” and morgan stanley  co llc “morgan stanley” guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that wedbush or morgan stanley fails to perform with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

with respect to us equities cboe trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to wedbush and morgan stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date cboe trading uses wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of credit suisse securities usa llc as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools morgan stanley clears trades routed through the morgan stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools cboe trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution 

with respect to us listed equity and exchange traded product options cboe trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution 

our exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers and other third parties to satisfy their contractual obligations to us moreover we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

while neither cboe fx nor cboe sef has direct counterparty risk cboe fx or cboe sef may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx and cboe sef may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot fx on the cboe fx platform or nondeliverable forward fx transactions on cboe sef 

 

we may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service which could subject us to trading losses when our brokerdealer disposes of that position 

we offer a smart‑order routing service through our broker‑dealer subsidiary cboe trading which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution in connection with this service we may assume ownership of a position in securities this may occur for example when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systems problems and is unable to determine the status of that order when this happens we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order we may be informed later however that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it in which case cboe trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of cboe trading into which such positions settle and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible which could result in our incurring trading losses 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we have experienced increased volume on our futures exchange extended trading hours on our futures exchange and in spx and vix options and developed several proprietary products we also experienced a substantial expansion of our business following our acquisition of bats which significantly expanded our product line across asset classes broadened our geographic reach with strong paneuropean equities and global fx positions and diversified our business mix with significant nontransactional revenue streams bats has also experienced significant growth in its business since its inception in 2005 with material expansions into diverse businesses including european listed cash equity securities us listed equity options and global institutional spot fx trading in addition in 2017 we acquired the assets of silexx 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed furthermore failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our business financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe or cboe sef the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe global markets the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income if this occurs we may experience a higher effective state tax rate 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth 

 

and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results see also “risks relating to the merger” for additional information 

prior to the merger bats generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from and was provided with significant liquidity in its markets and other services by entities who are affiliates of its former significant stockholders and there is no assurance that such entities will continue to generate such revenue or provide such liquidity and other services following the merger 

prior to the merger bats earned a significant percentage of its revenue from customers who are affiliates of its former significant stockholders in addition bats relied on and we continue to rely on certain entities who are affiliates of former significant bats stockholders to route orders that were not routed directly by bats and to clear certain trades routed to other markets the proportionate stake in the combined company of these former bats stockholders is significantly less than their stake in bats prior to the merger so there may be less incentive for the affiliates of bats’ former stockholders to maintain their business relationships with us at the preexisting levels or at all if the affiliates of bats’ former stockholders do not remain customers at their preexisting levels or at all or if any of the affiliates of bats’ former stockholders do not continue to route and clear trades as they did prior to the merger we may experience decreased revenues and business interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may negatively affect the valuation of our common stock 

our business experiences seasonal fluctuations reflecting reduced trading activity generally during the third quarter of each year and during the last month of each year as a result it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors if this happens the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

we may be required to inject further capital into occ or euroccp 

occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges under occs capital plan each of occs existing exchange stockholders which include cboe options agreed to provide its pro rata share in replenishment capital up to a maximum of 40 million per exchange stockholder if certain capital thresholds are breached in addition cboe europe owns 20 of euroccp which is one of three interoperable central counterparties used to clear trades conducted on cboe europe if occ or euroccp were to experience financial difficulties cboe options and cboe europe as applicable might be required to inject further capital into them in order to maintain their working or regulatory capital in a worst case scenario occ or euroccp as applicable might have their regulatory license suspended or withdrawn or might have to wind down this may result in a loss to cboe options and cboe europe of their respective investments in occ and euroccp and withdrawals of occ or euroccp as clearing houses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our operations outside of the us expose us to currency risk 

in addition to our operations in the us we have operations in the uk continental europe ecuador hong kong and singapore we therefore have significant exposure to exchange rate movements between the british pound the euro the hong kong dollar and the singapore dollar against the us dollar significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic conditions 

 

acts of war or terrorism changes in governmental monetary or tax policy brexit or changes in local interest rates these exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non‑us results of operations and financial condition into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe global markets depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 













furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors 

 

we indirectly hold 100 of the issued share capital and voting rights in cboe europe and its wholly owned subsidiary cboe chix europe as a result any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock is subject to certain regulatory requirements under uk law 

a person that indirectly acquires control in a fca entity is required to file a change in control notice with the fca though both are fca regulated entities the statutorily prescribed change in control notification threshold for cboe europe is acquisition of voting power with respect to 20 or more of the issued share capital thereof the change in control notification threshold for cboe chix europe is acquisition of voting power with respect to 10 or more of the issued share capital thereof therefore any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be required to file a change in control notice in respect of cboe chix europe and if this holding is in excess of 20 also for cboe europe this obligation may discourage delay or prevent accumulations of 10 or more of our common stock 

risks relating to the merger 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or such benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our businesses with bats’ businesses the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result our combined company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with those of bats if integration is implemented ineffectively it could preclude realization of the full benefits expected from the merger including synergies cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could seriously harm our results of operations in addition the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of operating our combined company include 























many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the combined company’s 

 

operations are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings and growth opportunities these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result we cannot assure you that the merger   will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated 

we incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the merger which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we incurred indebtedness of approximately 165 billion to finance a portion of the cash component of the merger consideration refinance indebtedness of bats and its subsidiaries and pay related fees and expenses the indebtedness consists of a 1 billion unsecured term loan facility and 650 million in senior unsecured notes we also entered into a 150 million revolving credit facility in december 2016 which may be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes we refinanced 300 million of the amounts outstanding under the term loan facility with new senior unsecured notes as of december 31 2017 we had 300 million outstanding under the term loan facility 900 million of senior unsecured notes and no funds outstanding under the revolving credit facility prior to entering into the merger agreement we did not have any indebtedness and were not subject to any financial covenants the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our increased indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions our increased indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements we are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes further a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

we have received investment grade credit ratings from sp global ratings bbb and moody’s investor service baa1 ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs could increase 

 

a failure to migrate our information technology systems successfully following the merger or a material disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems the failure of information technology systems to operate effectively difficulty in migrating our information technology systems inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results in addition a number of our tphs are not connected to bats’ technology platforms and must complete the process of connecting to these platforms as part of the migration 

the process of migrating information technology systems may take longer cost more and provide fewer synergies than initially anticipated there may also be new regulations adopted during the transition period that require systems changes which could divert attention away from migration process and cause delays to the extent this occurs the benefits of the proposed transaction may be reduced or delayed or may never come to fruition although our combined management team has experience with migrating other businesses to bats’ technology platform there are certain portions of our business such as open outcry trading that have not yet been supported by bats’ technology platform 

we currently expect to complete the migration of our information technology systems in phases over a fouryear period following the merger however we may not be able to successfully achieve the transition on the timetable currently contemplated and the transition may not be successful or could encounter various difficulties and unexpected issues any delays or issues that we encounter in the transition could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and could negatively affect our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition as well as impair customer confidence in our product offerings and overall services 

if our goodwill investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired the resulting charge to earnings may be significant 

accounting standards in the us require that one party to the merger be identified as the acquirer in accordance with these standards the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of bats by cboe and followed the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations the assets and liabilities of bats were consolidated with our assets and liabilities the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of bats’ assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill 

we will be required to assess investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill intangible assets or investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

a number of significant structural political and monetary issues continue to confront the global economy and instability could return at any time resulting in an increased level of market volatility increased trading volumes and a return of uncertainty in contrast many of the largest customers of our transactional businesses continue to adapt their business models as they address the implementation of regulatory changes initiated following the global financial crisis 

 

components of revenues 

transaction fees 

transaction fees represent fees charged by the company for the performance obligation of executing a trade on its markets these fees can be variable based on trade volume tiered discounts however as all tiered discounts are calculated monthly the actual discount is recorded on a monthly basis transaction fees as well as any tiered volume discounts are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with the company’s published fee schedules transaction fees are recognized across all segments the company also pays liquidity payments to customers based on its published fee schedules the company uses these payments to improve the liquidity on its markets and therefore recognizes those payments as a cost of revenue 

access fees 

access fees represent fees assessed for the opportunity to trade including fees for tradingrelated functionality across all segments they are billed monthly in accordance with the company’s published fee schedules and recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is met there is no remaining performance obligation after revenue is recognized

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees primarily represent fees collected by the company to cover the section 31 fees charged to the exchanges under the authority of the sec cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga and are charged by the sec consistent with industry practice the fees charged to customers are based on the fee set by the sec per notional value of the transaction executed on the company’s markets and calculated and billed monthly these fees are recognized in the us equities and options segments and as the exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment to the sec the exchanges are considered the principals in these transactions regulatory fees also include the options regulatory fee orf charged to customers which supports the company’s regulatory oversight function in the options segment

routing and clearing 

various rules require that us options and cash equities trade executions occur at the national best bidoffer nbbo displayed by any exchange linkage order routing consists of the cost incurred to provide a service whereby cboe equity and options exchanges deliver orders to other execution venues when there is a potential for obtaining a better execution price or when instructed to directly route an order to another venue by the order provider the service affords exchange order flow providers an opportunity to obtain the best available execution price and may also result in cost benefits to those clients such an offering improves our competitive position and provides an opportunity to attract orders which would otherwise bypass our exchanges we utilize thirdparty brokers or our brokerdealer cboe trading to facilitate such delivery 

section 31 fees 

exchanges under the authority of the sec cboe options c2 bzx byx edgx and edga are assessed fees pursuant to the exchange act designed to recover the costs to the us government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals we treat these fees as a passthrough charge to customers executing eligible listed cash equities and listed equity options trades accordingly we recognize the amount that we are charged under section 31 as a cost of revenues and the corresponding amount that we charge our customers as regulatory transaction fees revenue since the regulatory transaction fees recorded in revenues are equal to the section 31 fees recorded in cost of revenues there is no impact on our operating income cfe cboe europe equities and cboe fx are not us national securities exchanges and accordingly are not charged section 31 fees 

royalty fees 

royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid by us for the use of underlying indexes in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded the company has licenses with the owners of the sp 500 index sp 100 index and certain other sp indexes ftse russell indexes the djia msci and certain other index products this category also includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to sp indexes

associated with remeasuring net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the jobs act due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the jobs act we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31 2017 as we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the jobs act and any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts 

we have recorded a 1913 million net tax benefit in 2017 associated with the impact of the jobs act primarily due to the tax benefit associated with remeasuring net deferred tax liabilities although the 1913 million net benefit represents what cboe believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the jobs act on cboe’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 it should be considered provisional once cboe finalizes certain tax positions and files its 2017 us tax return it will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to its net deferred tax liability as well as to the liability associated with the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of tax expense benefit in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018

cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all nonrestricted highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2017 increased 462 million from december 31 2016 primarily driven by the bats acquisition and payment of longterm debt offset by the proceeds from longterm debt see “cash flow” below for further discussion

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees 

we use wedbush securities and morgan stanley to clear our routed cash equities transactions in our us equities segment wedbush securities and morgan stanley guarantee the trade until one day after the trade date after which time the nscc provides a guarantee in the case of failure to perform on the part of one of our clearing firms wedbush securities or morgan stanley we provide the guarantee to the counterparty to the trade the occ acts as a central 

 

counterparty on all transactions in listed equity options in our options segment and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our options transactions we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

our equity method investment euroccp has entered into a liquidity facility with abn amro clearing bank nv “aacb” based on our shareholders’ agreement with euroccp cboe europe limited has provided a guarantee to aacb of up to €6 million we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under this guarantee is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for this guarantee 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

for further discussion related to revenue recognition of fees such as transaction fees and liquidity payments access fees exchange services and other fees market data fees and regulation transaction and section 31 fees see note 4 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions of bats vest silexx and livevol resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350— intangibles—goodwill and other  we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using the october 1 carrying values goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with asc 35020 if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess if the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is less than their carrying value an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount 

 

equal to the difference we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2017 and determined that no impairment existed 

purchase accounting 

tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition the difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense when available the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices information from comparable transactions offers made by other prospective acquirers in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness level 1 and 2 unobservable inputs such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value level 3 are used if observable inputs are not available as noted in asc 805 business combinations  the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to twelve months after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition   see note 5 for additional information 

  

stockbased compensation 

we have historically granted stockbased compensation to our employees in the form of restricted stock units with the acquisition of bats we also assumed bats’ grants of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees we record the related compensation expense based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by fasb we recognize these compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model stockbased compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock is based on the fair value at the grant date we recognized compensation expense of approximately 501 million 145 million and 121 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively this expense is included in the compensation and benefits expense and acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of income assumptions used to estimate compensation expense are determined as follows 







 





income taxes 

deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in our opinion it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 

foreign currency 

the functional currency of cboe europe and certain cboe fx operations is the british pound certain cboe fx operations also use the singapore dollar and hong kong dollar as functional currency we also bill our european customers in their local currencies which are primarily euros but also include swiss francs norwegian kroners swedish kronas and danish kroners the assets and liabilities of cboe europe and certain cboe fx operations are translated from british pounds singapore dollars and hong kong dollars into us dollars using the relevant exchange rate in effect as of each balance sheet date statements of income and cash flow amounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period the cumulative effects of translating the balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the us dollar at the applicable exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and have historically not been material 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the company 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk equity risk credit risk and interest rate risk we have implemented policies and procedures to measure manage and monitor and report risk exposures which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a result of the acquisition of bats we expanded our operations in europe and asia and are subject to currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound singapore dollar hong kong dollar and the euro we also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies including the swiss franc norwegian kroner swedish krona and danish kroner 

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our exposure to foreigndenominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table 





equity risk 

our investment in european operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to us dollars the assets and liabilities of our european business are denominated in british pounds fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of these nonus dollar statements of financial condition into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 

our primary exposure to this equity risk as of december 31 2017 is presented by foreign currency in the following table 





credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk from third parties including customers counterparties and clearing agents these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we limit our exposure to credit risk by selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the us and europe with respect to listed cash equities we deliver matched trades of our customers to the nscc without taking on 

 

counterparty risk for those trades nscc acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on bzx byx edgx and edga and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades similarly with respect to us listed equity options and futures we deliver matched trades of our customers to the occ which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on cboe options c2 bzx edgx and cfe and as such guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades 

with respect to orders cboe trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers cboe trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms morgan stanley  co llc morgan stanley or wedbush securities inc wedbush securities morgan stanley and wedbush securities guarantee trades until one day after the trade date after which time nscc provides a guarantee thus cboe trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that morgan stanley or wedbush securities fails we believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees 

historically we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in marketwide credit difficulties or other market disruptions 

we do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot fx trades occurring on our platform because cboe fx is not a counterparty to any fx transactions all transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade while cboe fx does not have direct counterparty risk cboe fx may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event therefore cboe fx may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade fx on the cboe fx platform 

we also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheet our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets 

on a regular basis we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations any such effects to date have been minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2017 and 2016 our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were 1908 million and 973 million respectively of which 449 million is held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries in 2017  no cash or cash equivalents were held outside of the united states as of december 31 2016 the remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes due to the nature of these investments we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being 

 

exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial instruments 

as of december 31 2017 we had 125 billion in outstanding debt of which 9500 million relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixedrate obligations the remaining amount outstanding of 3000 million relates to the term loan agreement which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement as of december 31 2017 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 30 million assuming no change composition of our outstanding indebtedness we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as this facility bears interest at fluctuating rates as of december 31 2017 there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement s ee note 13 debt to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements

industry 

our primary business of offering exchangetraded options and futures contracts on financial instruments is part of the large global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset or reference value while derivatives exist on a wide range of underlying assets and references we currently focus on offering derivatives products on individual stocks indexes exchangetraded funds exchangetraded notes and various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset most options traded on us securities exchanges and overthecounter are on individual equities market indexes and etps 

a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that are settled by the delivery of the underlying asset or in cash by reference to the underlying asset or reference at a specified price and on a specified future date futures on cfe are settled in cash options on futures may also be listed for trading on futures exchanges

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3700 underlying stocks indexes and etps among other products the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including marketmakers is a key feature of the options market marketmakers collectively provide continuous bids and offers for all listed options series 

trends 

mix of transaction fees 

our proprietary products are those in which we have a property right or for which we have an exclusive license and contribute almost all of our transaction fee revenues for index options and all of our transaction fee revenues for futures listed options on equities and etps currently may be listed on all options exchanges while trading in our proprietary products is currently limited to our exchanges thus our proprietary products are able to support a higher revenue per contract than multiplylisted products 

over the past five years our transaction fees generated by our futures and index options increased from approximately 575  of total transaction fees in 2011 to approximately 882  in 2016  this increase is primarily due to increased trading volume and fees generated by our proprietary vix options and futures and spx options more recently average daily volume adv for our proprietary vix options and futures and spx options is up 8  from 2015 led by trading in vix futures which is up 16  from 2015 

price competition 

the number of us options exchanges that we compete with has more than doubled over the past eleven years from five exchanges to fifteen in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology as the listed options business provides transaction processors with a new source of revenue for scalable systems and offers greater margins than the equity trading business we expect that our competitors or new entrants into the exchange business may continue to open new options exchanges 

the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multiplylisted options business to their exchanges which has reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multiplylisted options liquidity providers are attracted to markets primarily through the incentives for customer order flow from which they can attempt to generate trading profits liquidity providers are also attracted by low transaction fees and credits to post liquidity order flow particularly customer order flow is the primary driver of multiplylisted options exchange volumes and in the past several years the competition for this business has increased significantly due in part to the role of firms known as consolidators who operate both order execution and market making businesses and collect customer order flow from originating brokers which they then route and execute as a service to that customer these consolidators base their routing decisions among other things on best execution technology liquidity service pricing and other factors including in some cases their ability to internalize order flow for potential trading profits some exchanges have structured their options businesses in partnership with established market participants such as consolidators and other order flow providers while others offer specific payments for order flow in addition to any economic incentives received from marketmakers and other participants 

regulatory oversight 

we are subject to regulation by the sec and the cftc and market participants may be subject to regulation by the sec the cftc the board of governors of the federal reserve the us department of the treasury andor foreign regulators laws and regulations regarding our business and the business of market participants are frequently modified or changed see regulatory environment and compliance for more information on significant areas of regulation of us as the number of legislative actions have increased such as the implementation of basel iii doddfrank and the collins amendment to doddfrank some market participants have adjusted their businesses 

competitive strengths

we believe that the listed options and futures industry especially with respect to volatility trading has significant growth potential including through new participants and products our mission is to be the leader in providing innovative products that facilitate and enhance trading in a global marketplace we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 



 7 

product and business lines across new regions and asset classes in 2016 we made a majority investment in cboe vest an investment manager focused on target outcome investment strategies and made a minority equity investment in eris exchange holdings llc “eris” a us  based futures exchange group offering swap futures as a capitalefficient alternative to overthecounter swaps 

in addition we believe the recently announced merger squarely fits into our growth strategy outlined above to develop unique products expand our customer base and leverage alliances that complement our core business specifically we believe that the merger has the potential to significantly expand and diversify our product line across new asset classes such as us and european equities etf trading and global foreign currencies fx products broaden our reach with bats’ marketleading european presence and increase our nontransactional revenue stream while enabling us to streamline the combined company’s technology and enhance our strong growth and margin profile 

products 

our exchanges provide a marketplace for the trading of options and futures contracts that meet criteria established in the rules of the respective exchange the options contracts listed for trading include options on indexes equities and etps in addition we provide a marketplace for trading futures contracts through cfe 

types of products 

 increased flexibility 

over the past few years we have expanded our offerings and experienced increases in our existing offerings that allow for customers to trade options on a number of different time horizons allowing them to pinpoint their preferred timing in addition to standard option terms we also offer options with weekly end of month and end of quarter expirations our weeklys product in particular has seen rapid growth especially in spx and in 2016 we added monday and wednesday expiring spx weeklys we believe that the flexibility provided by these offerings allows us to meet the differing needs of our customers and increase trading volume 

proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility indexes based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the sp 100 the russell 2000 and the djia volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index the cboe sp 500 smile index and a series of options strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 russell 2000 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indexes we have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted others the rights to sublicense certain indexes the company generates revenue from both the calculation and dissemination of index values and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for indexes index options and other products in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list certain products based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

 8 

 spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indexes and is considered a bellwether for the u s economy the options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of its status as a bellwether spx is traded in a number of different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices 

  

over the past six years we have seen a significant increase in the number of spx weeklys contracts traded one of our fastest growing products as a percentage of total spx contracts traded the percentage of spx weeklys has increased from 22  in 2010 to 378  in 2016 we believe that traders are using this product to fine tune the timing of hedging strategies and maximize the risk premium in strategies that involve the sale of options such as covered call writing 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the volatility trading space with its introduction of the cboe volatility index the vix index in 1993 we introduced futures on the vix index in 2004 and options in 2006 the vix index is based on realtime prices of options on the sp 500 index and is designed to reflect investors consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future we also offer vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorterterm 

while the trading volumes in options and futures on the vix index have increased over the past five years trading volumes in these products are especially sensitive to market volatility with increases in volume generally occurring along with spikes in volatility while we believe that there will be continued intrinsic growth in our volatility products significant changes in the levels of market volatility may significantly impact volumes in these products 

in addition to the vix index we offer other products based on the vix methodology including futures on cboe russell 2000 volatility index and the cboecbot 10year us treasury note volatility index cfe also lists futures on realized variance while volumes in our nonvix futures volatility products are not material to us we continue to explore opportunities to expand our volatility product offerings with respect to both new indexes and new asset classes 

ftse russell 

the london stock exchange groups lseg leading global index franchises ftse russell indexes represent a diverse group of domestic and global equities with international appeal the russell indexes include widely followed 

 9 

benchmarks of usbased stocks while the ftse indexes focus primarily on global and emerging markets equity benchmarks that are widely used in the us market ftse russell indexes are among the largest and most widely used by investors in the us and us etfs tracking ftse russell indexes comprise some of the most actively traded globally 

the options we offer on the ftse russell indexes currently include the russell 2000 russell 1000 russell 1000 value russell 1000 growth ftse emerging ftse 100 and ftse china 50 indexes and are exclusive to us in 2016 we launched options on the ftse emerging ftse 100 and ftse china 50 indexes enabling investors to target emerging uk and chinese equity markets respectively 

strategic partnerships 

the company also acquires interests in and forms partnerships with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue of particular note are the following 

 

 

 

 

 options exchanges market participants 

as discussed in more detail below our options exchanges are designed to provide reliable orderly liquid and efficient marketplaces for the trading of options by market participants our options exchanges operate quotedriven auction markets that involve a number of different market participants 

trading permit holders 

purchasing a monthly trading permit for the respective exchange conveys trading permit holder status on that exchange to the permit holder 

a trading permit holder on one of our options exchanges is allowed to enter orders and quotes if it is a marketmaker into the trading system for that exchange trading permit holder entities can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other permit holders or for the accounts of customers 

applicants for trading permit holder status 

 10 

applicants for trading permit holder status must have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of a trading permit holder all trading permit holders must abide by the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange the provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the sec 

trading permits and participant roles 

the following types of trading permits entitle the holders to conduct business on the exchanges during the regular trading hours session in the applicable participant roles described below 

 

 in addition separate extended trading hours permits marketmaker trading permits and eaps generally entitle the holders to conduct business on cboe during the extended trading hours session 

cfe market participants 

parties are required to apply and be approved as cfe tphs and obtain a cfe trading permit in order to have trading privileges on cfe tphs on cfe are allowed to enter orders into cfes trading system and can execute trades for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers 

under its rules cfe has the authority to establish marketmaker programs and appoint one or more dpms lmms or marketmakers cfe does not currently have a dpm lmm or marketmaker program in vix futures with standard monthly expirations cfe does have a dpm or lmm program for vix futures with weekly expirations and cfes other products 

market model 

algorithms 

the matching algorithms used on our exchanges are the means by which trades are allocated to market participants our technology and the rules of our exchanges provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers we have the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products in order to meet the needs of particular market segments the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of market participants 

 details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

pricing 

 11 

each of our exchanges establishes a fee schedule that among other things sets the transaction fee for buying or selling options or futures contracts on the exchange and the connectivity and access fees for participating as a tph on the exchange in our proprietary products we assess transaction fees on all participants with the amount of the fee based on the market participants role and the origin of the underlying order and subject to discounts based on relative volume or trading strategies in multiplylisted products cboe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees are charged to most professionals including marketmakers but are not charged for most customer orders additionally cboe offers incentive programs to attract customer order flow including certain payments for order flow and our volume incentive program vip which pays credits to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of qualifying customer business at the exchange 

cfe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s central limit order book or is a block trade cfe also offers day trade and new foreign trader incentive programs that provide rebates on trades that qualify for the respective programs 

each of the exchanges also currently charges a fee for trading permits that allow access to our exchanges cboe has a sliding scale for all marketmaker trading permits used by affiliated tphs and tph organizations that satisfy certain requirements in our multiplylisted options classes 

competition 

cboe is the single largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 271  to 299  annually for 2016  our market share was 277  

in our proprietary products we compete against futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products as well as against financial market participants that offer similar overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products such as options on spy which offer some of the market exposure of our proprietary products such as options on spx 

the multiplylisted options industry is extremely competitive and the competition has intensified we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the price quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaption and our reputation we compete in various ways with the thirteen other us options exchanges 

the options exchanges frequently introduce new pricing models in order to attract additional trades to their exchanges these pricing models include traditional pricing makertaker and ownership benefits see trends  price competition 

our competitive challenge is to persuade brokerdealers to route options orders to our exchanges rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their marketmaking activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on equities and etps we compete through a variety of methods including

technology 

cboe command 

cboe command our inhouse developed java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and low latency supports trading on all of our exchanges the platform supports trading nearly 24 hours 5 days a week on cfe and supports an early morning trading session for spx and vix options on cboe the technology supports different products different market models and multiple matching algorithms as well as a fully integrated complex order book and several auction mechanisms as mentioned above cboe is a hybrid exchange combining features of screenbased and floorbased trading while c2 and cfe are fully electronic 

cboe command supports both a quotedriven options market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations and an orderdriven market model for our futures exchange cboe and c2 marketmakers dpms and lmms typically stream hundreds of millions of quotes into cboe command each day cboe command provides a number of risk controls geared towards both customers using our markets as well as liquidity providers quoting large numbers of options 

cboe command allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products cboe also offers cflex our hybrid platform for trading flex options built on the cboe command platform 

cboe vector 

in 2015 we began inhouse custom development of cboe vector our next generation of trading technology this new platform is designed to provide streamlined access to a comprehensive array of options and volatility products and to the deeply liquid markets in which they trade 

the advanced architecture of the platform was designed to deliver bestinclass functionality low latency ease of use improved connectivity and trading efficiency the platform is engineered to provide greatly increased transaction speeds while handling constantly increasing message traffic and industry demand for additional functionality such as risk controls however the launch of cboe vector on cfe is suspended due to the pending merger 

hybrid trading model 

all cboe products trade with an electronic and openoutcry component where both are integrated to function as a single market our hybrid trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe command trading platform for our amsettled spx options certain of the electronic trading features are differently configured to better suit the needs of customers in those products 

in general cboe marketmakers stream their own individual quotes into the cboe trading engine and if on the floor engage in open outcry transactions in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer the best of both electronic and open outcry trading models 

market data 

market data is sent to the options price reporting authority opra and cboe streaming markets csm described below our exchanges generate valuable information regarding the prices of our products and the trading activity in our exchanges for options market data relating to price and size of market quotations and the price and size of trades is collected and consolidated by opra opra disseminates the information for a fee to vendors who redistribute the data to brokers investors and other persons or entities that use our markets or that monitor general market conditions after costs are deducted the fees collected are distributed among opras exchange participants based on their cleared transactions pursuant to the opra plan as of december 2016  our market data was available on approximately 137000 terminals worldwide see regulatory environment and compliance for further information on opra

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for cboe c2 and cfe we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we continue to work to improve both the availability of our systems and our disaster recovery facilities including through simulation testing 

clearing system 

the options clearing corporation occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us options exchanges occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on cfe upon execution of an options or futures trade we transmit to occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes 

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion covers the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions to address perceived problems new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of certain recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

cftc core principles 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets dcms like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to the new requirements however one aspect with respect to the amended core principles applicable to dcms that remains pending relates to amended core principle 9 core principle 9 requires each dcm to provide a competitive open and efficient market and mechanism for executing transactions that protects the price discovery process of trading in the dcm’s centralized market cftc regulations to implement core principle 9 remain pending and may address the extent to which a dcm may permit block trades and exchanges of derivatives for related positions in its products to occur through the dcm outside of the dcm’s centralized market cfe cannot predict or estimate the extent to which these regulations may affect cfe or its operations 

automated trading 

in november 2015 the cftc issued a rulemaking proposal relating to automated trading on dcms referred to as regulation automated trading regulation at in november 2016 the cftc issued a supplemental rulemaking proposal which included modifications to the original proposal the rulemaking proposal proposes risk control and other requirements for a certain market participants that are defined as “at persons” b executing futures commission merchants fcms and c dcms 

regulation at is intended to reduce potential risks arising from electronic trading activity by requiring the implementation of risk controls such as maximum order message and maximum order size parameters and the establishment of standards for the development testing and monitoring of automated trading systems among other requirements automated trading persons at persons and executing fcms would be required to submit annual certifications to dcms attesting to their compliance with regulation at and dcms would be required to establish programs for the periodic review and evaluation of compliance with regulation at by at persons and executing fcms regulation at also proposes to require the registration of proprietary traders with direct electronic access to a dcm that have average daily trading volume of 20000 contracts across all products and dcms over a 6 month period and to require that these at persons become members of a registered futures association in addition regulation at is intended to foster transparency around dcm marketmaker and trading incentive programs 

although cfe may require additional resources to comply with the proposal if it were to be adopted by the cftc cfe does not expect that the proposal will have a material impact on cfe or its operations 

systems safeguards 

in september 2016 the cftc issued a final rule to amend its system safeguards rules for dcms by enhancing and clarifying existing provisions relating to system safeguards risk analysis and oversight and cybersecurity testing and adding new provisions concerning certain aspects of cybersecurity testing the rule clarified the existing system safeguards rules for dcms by specifying and defining the types of cybersecurity testing required to fulfill system safeguards testing obligations 

 14 

including vulnerability testing penetration testing controls testing security incident response plan testing and enterprise technology risk assessment the rule also clarified the categories of risk analysis and oversight that statutorilyrequired programs of system safeguardsrelated risk analysis and oversight must address system safeguardsrelated books and records obligations the scope of system safeguards testing internal reporting and review of testing results and remediation of vulnerabilities and deficiencies the provisions of the final rule have various compliance dates most of which are one year from september 19 2016 the effective date of the rule although cfe may require additional resources to comply with the final rule cfe does not expect the rule to result in significant changes to its operations 

compliance 

securities industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an exchange sro is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules and regulating its members known as tphs at cboe and c2 through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 exchange operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market operations and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of cboes or c2s rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

in november 2015 the compliance date for regulation systems compliance and integrity “reg sci” sec began rulemaking under the exchange act  reg sci requires “sci entities” which includes sros like cboe and c2 to comply with security and capacity requirements with respect to their systems and accompanying compliance procedures as part of complying with reg sci cboe and c2 established written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a resilient market in the event of a disruption this includes for example each exchange ensuring that it has adequate disaster 

 15 

recovery facilities that are geographically diverse from the exchange’s systems and that facilitate the ability to resume trading within specified timeframes when certain critical and noncritical sci systems are rendered inoperable it also requires timely and substantial notification to be made to the sec in the event an exchange experiences certain system interruptions or interference the sec has also established various working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency including regarding regulatory halts trade nullification and additional market protections as adopted reg sci and the other sec mandated working group initiatives are very complex and as such compliance with rules may require significant resources 

consent order 

on june 11 2013 cboe and c2 entered into a consent order with the sec under which cboe and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings these undertakings included conducting a review of our regulatory programs enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implementing training programs for employees we have certified to the completion of these undertakings the consent order also requires ongoing certifications by the companys chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer until 2019 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are also subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure fair representation of trading permit holders in the selection of cboe and c2 directors public participation in the governance of cboe and c2 and that cboe and c2 can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of cboe and c2 and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of cboe or c2 relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out their responsibilities under the exchange act to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to cboe and c2 the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the us be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business and relating to the merger these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity cash flows and the merger 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indexes and based on which we have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2016  approximately 882  of our transaction fees were generated by our futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products and products based on the vix methodology the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our sp 500 index options and vix index options and futures as a result our operating revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition the european parliament has adopted legislation that will require european exchanges to provide nondiscriminatory access to benchmarks like index options and is considering other legislation that may impact the ability of european banks to trade our products while similar legislation has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose exclusivity in our internally developed and licensed index products the adopted and proposed european legislation may impact our expansion activities in europe and may reduce the volume on our exchanges from international customers 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

 20 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options and futures transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 general economic conditions affect options and futures trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy may have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra with respect to our options exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain responsibility for the regulation of our tphs see business—regulatory responsibilities 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and dcms respectively pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if the sec or cftc were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient cboe c2 or cfe could be the subject of sec or cftc investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of an exchanges registration as a national securities exchange or dcm any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe c2 or cfe may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

 21 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the options exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with cboe and c2 see business—regulatory responsibilities 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer overthecounter derivatives we also compete on price against certain multiplylisted options products including spy that offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2016  2015  and 2014  approximately 705  719  and 709  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including basel iii doddfrank and the collins amendment to doddfrank may cause market participants to reduce the number of trades they make on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis—operating revenues—average revenue per contract if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options or futures markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and futures industries we have also experienced an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our 

 22 

business 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while many of its requirements have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented some of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them 

under the collins amendment to the doddfrank act starting in 2015 large us banks are required to compute their risk weighted assets which include exchangetraded options and futures this and other rulemaking may lead to further increases in capital requirements for us bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives these increased capital requirements may reduce trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated clearing members and brokerdealers reducing their own trading charging their customers more to trade reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of marketmaker clearing 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to create implement and maintain the cat which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market in addition to increased regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures including to implement any new technology to meet any plans requirements 

under european union eu regulations european banks and other european financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu the current deadline for the eu to qualify foreign clearinghouses as equivalent is june 15 2017 if the eu does not recognize occ as a qualified clearinghouse by such date or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended then european market participants that clear through occ would become subject to punitive capital charges as a result we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the brexit vote resulted in regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and could adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions throughout europe 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

in addition congress the sec foreign regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the options or futures industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer comparable products and with the overthecounter market with respect to our proprietary products with respect to our multiplylisted products our principal competitors are the thirteen other us options exchanges see the risk factor entitled our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

 23 

in addition indexes underlying our products including vix and spx may be licensed for use in similar otc options needs or preferences of investors could change leading to a migration to the market of some trades that today could be entered into on our exchanges options on etfs and etns that have such licenses on these indexes are available for trading as a result trading in our products could decrease due to competitive pressures from these alternative products 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

 the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results would be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ and its member clearing firms securities information processors such as the cta and opra regulatory service providers such as finra and nfa the host of our data center and various vendors of communications and networking products and services more specifically 

 we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services or 

 24 

make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products may suffer 

we are a party to an increasing number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indexes including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 index and sp 100 index sp dow jones indices llc for the dow jones industrial average lseg for more than two dozen ftse russell indexes including the russell 2000 index and msci inc for six msci indexes including the msci eafe index and msci emerging markets index these license agreements provide among other things that we are authorized to list options on their indexes and some of the resulting index options are among the most actively traded products at cboe the quality and integrity of each of these indexes are dependent on the ability of the index providers to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and we are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data to us we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indexes and uses of the indexes that infringe on our licenses as further discussed in risk factor we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

if we are unable to fulfill our obligations under the consent order it may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

in addition to entering into the consent order and agreeing to complete certain undertakings we may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the sec if the sec were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the consent order see business—regulatory environment and compliance—compliance—consent order any investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index and futures products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our 

 25 

products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and networks including the systems that comprise cboe command the platform for trading on our exchanges and cboe vector the platform that we are developing that is expected to replace cboe command if we are unable to operate monitor or maintain these systems and networks program them so that they operate correctly and maintain the integrity of their data or successfully transition from the cboe command platform to the new cboe vector trading platform it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup of trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all 

with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading activity or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading activity and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems our communications networks and the systems of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access including the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information malware and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control if our security measures are inadequate or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches and to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and may suffer harm to our reputation and litigation measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the confidentiality integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be 

 26 

inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees accounted for 80  of our operating revenues in 2016  cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our policies and procedures designed to meet those compliance responsibilities as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed or that our compliance and internal audit functions would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

misconduct by our tphs or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs other persons who use our markets or our employees may engage in fraud market manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market manipulation by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business the failure to retain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees especially those who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so 

 27 

particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems errors consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

over the past five years we have experienced significantly increased volume on our futures exchange extended trading hours on our futures exchange and in spx and vix options and developed several proprietary products we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins will be adversely affected 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe our futures exchange the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and a variety of threat actors have specifically targeted the financial services industry at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any material cases of data theft corruption or destruction of data or compromised customer data security breaches may among other consequences lead to increased scrutiny by our regulators and have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on the options and futures industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading

in 2015 the internal revenue service issued final and temporary regulations under section 871m that require dividend tax withholding for certain transactions completed by foreign persons that could result in a reduction in trading by such foreign persons either by their choice or as a result of brokers refusing to execute certain option trades for such persons 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants like other corporations we are subject to taxes at the federal state and local levels as well as in nonus jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations or policies could result in us having to pay higher taxes which would in turn reduce our net income there has been a trend toward states changing income tax laws to increase the apportionment factors on which state income taxes are based and becoming more aggressive asserting nexus over corporations that are not domiciled in the state if state income tax laws change or if states are successful asserting nexus against us we may become subject to income taxes in additional states or at a higher rate in the states where income tax filing requirements exists if this occurs we may experience a higher effective state tax rate 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock see “risk factors — risks relating to the merger” for additional discussion of our risks related to the merger 

in 2016 we made a majority investment in cboe vest an investment manager focused on target outcome investment strategies a minority investment in curveglobal a new interest rate derivatives venture of the lseg and a number of major dealer banks and made a minority equity investment in eris a us  based futures exchange group offering swap futures as a capitalefficient alternative to overthecounter swaps see also “businessstrategic partnership” for additional information regarding our strategic partnerships 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or and unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 



 29 

in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors 

risks relating to the merger 

failure to complete the proposed merger within the expected timeframe or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that the merger will occur the closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions including among others i the adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of bats common stock entitled to vote thereon ii approval of the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting of our stockholders called for such purpose iii the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and regulatory approval by the sec financial industry regulatory authority and the uk financial conduct authority iv no court order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger or the subsequent merger or imposing a “burdensome effect” as defined in the merger agreement upon the consummation thereof v the absence of any pending action commenced by a governmental or regulatory body wherein a judgment would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the merger or the subsequent merger or impose a burdensome effect upon the consummation thereof vi receipt of tax opinions from counsel to each of us and bats with respect to the treatment of the merger and subsequent merger from a tax perspective vii in the case of our obligation to effect the merger no exercise of appraisal rights by bats stockholders holding more than 20 of the outstanding shares of bats common stock viii in the case of each party’s obligation to effect the merger the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party since the date of the merger agreement and ix subject to materiality exceptions the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by us merger sub and merger llc on the one hand and bats on the other hand and compliance by us merger sub merger llc and bats in all material respects with our and their respective obligations under the merger agreement although certain of these conditions have been satisfied there can be no assurance that the remaining conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied in a timely matter or at all 

in particular before the proposed transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including the merger may be completed various clearances and approvals must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities these regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the merger the regulatory approvals may not be received at all may not be received in a timely fashion and may contain conditions on the completion of the merger however if any such conditions impose a “burdensome effect” as defined in the merger agreement the parties may not be obligated to complete the merger and either bats or we may have the right to terminate the merger agreement in addition our and bats’ obligations to complete the merger are conditioned on the receipt of certain regulatory approvals or waiver by the other party of such condition 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future businesses and financial results 

if the merger is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences including the following 

 30 

 

 

 

 

in addition if the merger is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if the merger is not completed we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business financial results and stock prices 

the announcement and pendency of the merger may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees customers and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation regardless of whether the merger is completed these risks to our business include the following all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our debt arrangements in connection with financing the merger may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our financial results 

on december 15 2016 we entered into a 10 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility on january 12 2017 we issued 650 million aggregate principal amount of our 3650 senior notes due 2027 the proceeds from this delayed draw term loan facility and issuance of our senior notes in addition to using cash on hand at cboe holdings and bats are expected to be used to finance a portion of the cash component of the merger consideration to refinance existing indebtedness of bats and its subsidiaries and to pay related fees and expenses in addition on december 15 2016 we entered into a 150 million revolving credit facility to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

prior to entering into the merger agreement we did not have any indebtedness and were not subject to any financial covenants the financial and other covenants to which we have agreed to in connection with the incurrence of the indebtedness and the combined company’s increased indebtedness may have the effect among other things of reducing the combined company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making the combined company more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions the combined company’s increased indebtedness will also 

 31 

increase borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit the combined company’s ability to repurchase shares of our common stock increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements the combined company will also be required to dedicate a larger portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 

the combined company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash from the combined company’s operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond the combined company’s control 

the combined company may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if the combined company cannot service its indebtedness the combined company may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of the combined company’s business strategy or prevent the combined company from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit its business additionally the combined company may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect the combined company’s financial results 

deterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money 

our longterm indebtedness is rated by sp global ratings and moody’s investors service there is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs and the costs of the proposed transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would increase 

the merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 

the merger agreement contains provisions that apply both during the pendency of the merger transaction with bats as well as afterward should the merger with bats not be consummated that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the merger these merger agreement provisions include a general prohibition on us from soliciting or subject to certain exceptions entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions in addition we may be required to pay bats a 110 million termination fee and reimburse bats for its expenses incurred in connection with the merger in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 million in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions 

the price of our common stock might increase or decline prior to the completion of the merger which would change the value of the merger consideration to be received by bats stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement 

the market price of our   common stock at the time the merger is completed may vary significantly from the price on the date of the merger agreement on september 22 2016 the last full trading day prior to media publications regarding the proposed merger our   common stock closed at 6941 per share as reported on nasdaq and on september 23 2016 the last full day of trading prior to the announcement of the merger agreement our common stock closed at 7030 per share as reported on nasdaq if the market price of our common stock increases above 7030 the market value of the merger consideration will be greater than 3250 per share of bats common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock to bats stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement will substantially reduce the percentage ownership interests of our preexisting stockholders 

based on the number of shares of our common stock and bats common stock outstanding on december 9 2016 the record date for the two companies special meetings of stockholders held in connection with the merger we expect to issue or reserve for issuance approximately 319 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement including shares of our common stock issuable to bats stockholders pursuant to outstanding and unexercised options to purchase bats common stock granted under any bats equity incentive plan whether vested or unvested and outstanding awards of restricted bats common stock granted under any bats equity incentive plan based on these numbers immediately following the completion of the merger our preexisting stockholders and former bats stockholders would own approximately 72 and 28 of the outstanding shares of our common stock respectively the merger will have no effect on the number of shares of our 

 32 

common stock owned by our existing stockholders the issuance of approximately 319 million shares of our common stock to bats stockholders and holders of equity incentive awards will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interests of our current stockholders in earnings voting liquidation value and book and market value 

the merger will result in changes to the board of directors and management of the combined company that may affect the strategy of the combined company as compared to our strategy as a standalone company 

if the parties complete the merger the composition of our board of directors and our management team will change from our current board and management team the board of directors of the combined company will consist of 14 members including three individuals designated by bats who are serving as bats directors immediately prior to the effective time of the merger we will also have executive officers from both us and bats this new composition of our board of directors and our management team may affect the business strategy and operating decisions of the combined company upon the completion of the merger 

we will incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger 

we and bats expect to incur a number of costs associated with completing the merger and integrating the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses resulting from the merger and will consist of transaction costs related to the merger facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment‑related costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses with bats’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or such benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses with bats’ businesses our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our businesses with bats’ businesses the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with those of bats the integration process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us the failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully our operations with those of bats or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could seriously harm its results of operations in addition the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention and may cause the combined company’s stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 33 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if bats’ and our operations are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the proposed transactions including the synergies cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of bats with us   will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

a failure to integrate successfully or a material disruption in information technology systems could adversely affect the combined company’s business and results of operations 

the combined company will rely extensively on its information technology systems the failure of information technology systems to operate effectively difficulty in integrating our information technology systems with bats’ information technology systems inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could adversely impact the business of the combined company in addition a number of our tphs are not connected to bats’ information technology platforms and will be required to complete the process of connecting to these platforms as part of the integration 

the process of integrating information technology systems may take longer cost more and provide fewer synergies than initially anticipated there may also be new regulations adopted during the transition period that require systems changes which could divert attention away from integration process and cause delays to the extent this occurs the benefits of the proposed transaction may be reduced delayed or may never come to fruition although bats has experience with transitioning other businesses to its information technology platform there are certain portions of our business such as open outcry trading and complex order trading that have not yet been addressed by bats’ information technology platform 

we currently expect to complete the integration of our information technology systems with those of bats in phases over a fouryear period following the merger however we may not be able to successfully achieve the transition on the timetable currently contemplated and the transition may not be successful or could encounter various difficulties and unexpected issues any delays or issues that we encounter in the transition could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the combined company and could negatively affect our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s overall business results of operations and financial condition as well as impair customer confidence in the combined company’s product offerings and overall services 

if the combined company is unable to manage its growth its business and financial results could suffer 

the combined company’s future financial results will depend in part on its ability to manage its core businesses including any growth that the combined company may be able to achieve over the past several years we   and bats have each engaged in the identification of and competition for growth and expansion opportunities in order to achieve those initiatives the combined company will need to among other things recruit train retain and effectively manage employees and expand its operations and financial control systems if the combined company is unable to manage its businesses effectively and profitably its business and financial results could suffer 

to be successful the combined company must retain and motivate key employees including those experienced with postacquisition integration and failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company 

the success of the combined company largely depends on the skills experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel as a result to be successful the combined company must retain and motivate executives and other key employees in particular the combined company expects to benefit from the integration experience of certain bats personnel certain key executives of bats have executed offer letters with us to continue their employment following the merger however these executives will continue to be at‑will employees and the offer letters provide no assurance that these executives will remain with the combined company additionally certain of our information technology employees will be 

 34 

important to retain during the transition period to effectively manage our information technology platforms and to assist bats in the process of integrating its information technology platform if these personnel were to leave the combined company may experience increased difficulty in the postmerger integration process maintenance of the current information technology platform and may not be able to adequately replace such personnel which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s overall business results of operations and financial condition 

our and bats’ employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company until integration strategies for the combined company are announced or executed these circumstances may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to retain key personnel the combined company also must continue to motivate employees and maintain their focus on the strategies and goals of the combined company doing so may be difficult due to the uncertainties and challenges associated with postmerger integration if the combined company is unable to retain executives and other key employees the roles and responsibilities of such executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees which may require the combined company to devote time and resources to identifying hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to integrate our and bats’ businesses or otherwise pursue business opportunities there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to retain and motivate its employees in the same manner as we   and bats have historically done 

the combined company may need to hire additional personnel in order to assist with the transition of our businesses to the bats information technology platform it may be difficult for the combined company to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers and if the combined company is unable to satisfy its needs for qualified and capable employees its business and operating results could be adversely affected 

there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space which may make it difficult for the combined company to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers increased difficulty in retaining or recruiting sufficient and qualified personnel by the combined company may lead to increased employment compensation costs which could adversely affect the combined company’s results of operations in addition the increased number of employees may impose a significant administrative burden on the combined company if the combined company is unable to retain and recruit highly qualified employees by offering competitive compensation stable work environment and leadership opportunities now and in the future the combined company’s business and operating results could be negatively impacted 

bats generates a significant percentage of its total revenues from and is provided with significant liquidity in its markets and other services by entities who are affiliates of its significant stockholders and there is no assurance that such entities will continue to generate such revenue or provide such liquidity and other services after the completion of the merger 

bats earns a significant percentage of its revenue from customers who are affiliates of its significant stockholders in addition bats relies on certain entities who are affiliates of significant bats stockholders to route orders that are not routed directly by bats and to clear certain trades routed to other markets the significant stockholders of bats may not receive shares of our common stock in the merger or even if they do their proportionate stake in the combined company will be significantly less than their stake in bats prior to the merger so there may be less incentive for the affiliates of bats’ significant stockholders to maintain their current business relationships with the combined company following the merger at current levels or at all if the affiliates of bats’ significant stockholders do not remain customers following the merger at current levels or at all or if any of the affiliates of bats’ significant stockholders do not continue to route and clear trades as they did prior to the merger the combined company may experience decreased revenues and business interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the combined company 

the combined company will record goodwill and intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

accounting standards in the united states require that one party to the merger be identified as the acquirer in accordance with these standards the merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of bats by us   and will follow the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations the assets and liabilities of bats will be consolidated with our assets and liabilities the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of bats’ assets and liabilities if any will be recorded as goodwill 

we will be required to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the future we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 35 

the merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first year following the completion of the merger this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change we could also encounter additional transaction and integration‑related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock 

the combined company will indirectly hold 100 of the issued share capital and voting rights in bats trading limited “btl” and its wholly owned subsidiary chix europe limited “chix europe” as a result any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock following the effective time of the merger will be subject to certain regulatory requirements under uk law 

a person that indirectly acquires control in a fca entity is required to file a change in control notice with the fca though both are fca regulated entities the statutorily prescribed change in control notification threshold for btl is acquisition of voting power with respect to 20 or more of the issued share capital thereof the change in control notification threshold for chix europe is acquisition of voting power with respect to 10 or more of the issued share capital thereof therefore any person who holds or has voting power with respect to 10 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be required to file a change in control notice in respect of chix europe and if this holding is in excess of 20 also for btl this obligation may discourage delay or prevent accumulations of 10 or more of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2016  the end of the period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 

the company reviews its legal proceedings and claims regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions the company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading the company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote the companys assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals 

as of december 31 2016  the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these reviews inspections or other legal proceedings if any has been incurred while the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on our earnings in any given reporting period however in the opinion of management the ultimate liability is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

 income taxes 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the company files tax returns for federal state and local income tax purposes a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 

if the company considers that a tax position is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position it recognizes the tax benefit the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position to the extent that the companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months interest and penalties if any are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the companys consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  this standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance in addition the asu provides guidance on accounting for certain revenuerelated costs including when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a 

 46 

contract asu 201409 provides companies with two implementation methods companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective application or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application modified retrospective application this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted the fasb deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date early adoption of the standard is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within those annual periods based on our evaluation of the standard we do not expect a material impact on our revenue recognition practices a significant portion of our revenue is generated from fees associated primarily with the execution of a trade transaction fees and regulatory fees and revenue is recognized on the trade date as our performance obligation would be complete the revenue components that are not primarily associated with the execution of a trade market data fees and exchange service and other fees are also not expected to be impacted by the adoption of the new standard in most cases our performance obligation is fulfilled on a monthly basis and does not require any additional requirements that would require performance beyond a monthly basis therefore we do not expect a material impact on our revenue recognition policies as a result of the adoption of the new standard which the company is considering early adoption prior to the effective date 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases  this update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding rightofuse asset the guidance also requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation — stock compensation  this standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for stockbased payment transactions including the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows an accounting policy election for forfeitures the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 and can be applied either prospectively retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method depending on the area covered in this update early adoption is permitted the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows 

in september 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 statement of cash flows topic 230 — classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force this standard addresses stakeholders’ concerns regarding diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under topic 230 statement of cash flows and other topics in particular asu no 201615 addresses eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce this diversity in practice 1 debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs 2 settlement of zerocoupon bonds 3 contingent consideration payments made after a business combination 4 proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims 5 proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies 6 distributions received from equity method investees 7 beneficial interests in securitization transactions and 8 separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle for public business entities that are sec filers the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years note that early adoption is permitted for all entities including adoption during an interim period the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 accounting for income taxesintraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  the standard requires that the income tax impact of intraentity sales and transfers of property except for inventory be recognized when the transfer occurs this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted the new standard should be applied by making a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of period of adoptionthe company is in the process of evaluating this guidance and considering early adoption though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows

average revenue per contract discussed in more detail below is impacted by our fee structure which includes volume based incentive programs mix of products traded the account type customer firm marketmaker etc and the manner in which a trade is executed the implementation of fee changes which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges we cannot predict the trading patterns of exchange participants which may be based on factors outside our control but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market 

trading volume is impacted by many factors including macroeconomic events market volatility regulatory actions or considerations availability of capital competition and pricing

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2016   increased   96  to 463 million  from 422 million  in the comparable period in the prior year the increase was primarily a result of higher fees for technology services and revenue generated from livevol which was acquired on august 7 2015 

market data fees 

market data fees increased   104  to 332 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 300 million  in the prior year for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  income derived from our market data services totaled 175 million  and 160 million  respectively revenue generated from our market data services which provide current and historical options and futures data increased 15 million  resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers and fees for certain market data services for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  opra income totaled 157 million  and 140 million  respectively income derived from opra is allocated based on each exchanges share of total cleared options transactions the companys share of total cleared options transactions for the year ended december 31 2016  increased to 244  from 233  for the same period in 2015  and total distributable opra income increased compared to the prior year ended 2015 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees increased   443  for the year ended 2016  to 483 million  from 335 million  in the same period in the prior year the increase in regulatory fees is primarily the result of an increase in our options regulatory fees resulting from increased costs associated with the regulation of cboe and c2 and other selfregulatory organization commitments 

regulatory fees are primarily generated by the options regulatory fee that we charge on all trading permit holder customer volume industrywide under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

other revenue 

other revenue decreased   60 million  for the year ended 2016  to 135 million  from 195 million  in the same period in the prior year the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower revenue from fines assessed for rule violations and in 2015 the recognition of revenue to adjust for incorrect coding of transactions by an exchange participant related to prior periods 

concentration of revenue   

all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2016  there were one hundred one  trading permit holders that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for 42  of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2016  the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 14  of transaction and other fees collected through occ no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing member firms represented more than 21  of transaction and other fees collected through occ for the respective clearing member in 2016  should a clearing member withdraw from cboe we believe the trading permit holder portion of that clearing members trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing member 

the two largest clearing members mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe c2 and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including ours 

operating expenses

275 million  for 2017 this includes 130 million  in accelerated stockbased compensation approximately 120 million  of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2017 the increase in accelerated stockbased compensation versus 2016 reflects a planned change in the retirement vesting schedule for equity award grants

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business this market risk consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents the company does not trade options for its own account 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our cash and cash equivalents were 973 million  and 1023 million  respectively we invest available cash in highly liquid shortterm investments such as money market funds and us treasury securities our investment policy is to preserve capital and liquidity a hypothetical three basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease annual earnings by less than 75000 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2016 we had no longterm indebtedness however as discussed above we intend to incur significant indebtedness in connection with the merger a portion of which is expected to be incurred at variable rates of interest accordingly following the merger we expect to be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or decline since transactions on our exchanges are not governed by longterm contracts we believe that any increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on us

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset most options traded on us securities exchanges and overthecounter are on individual equities market indexes and etps 

futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that are settled by the delivery of the underlying asset or in cash by reference to the underlying asset or reference at a specified price and on a specified future date futures on cfe are settled in cash options on futures may also be listed for trading on futures exchanges 

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3900 underlying stocks indexes and etps among other products the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including marketmakers is a key feature of the options market marketmakers collectively provide continuous bids and offers for all listed options series over the past decade trading in the options market has migrated from being primarily conducted facetoface or open outcry to being primarily electronic 

trends 

increased interest in our proprietary products 

our proprietary products are those in which we have a property right or for which we have an exclusive license and contribute almost all of our transaction fee revenues for index options and all of our transaction fee revenues for futures listed 

 4 

options on equities and etps currently may be listed on all options exchanges while trading in our proprietary products is limited to our exchanges thus our proprietary products are able to support a higher revenue per contract than multiplylisted products 

over the past five years average daily volume adv in our index options has increased from 127  million contracts to 162  million contracts and adv in our futures has increased from 48  thousand contracts to 205  thousand contracts the increase in index options and futures trading significantly outpaced the growth in the industry and multiplylisted products in this timeframe these increases are primarily due to increased interest in trading our proprietary vix options and futures and spx options see spx options and volatility trading 

price competition 

the number of us options exchanges that we compete with has more than doubled over the past ten years from five exchanges to twelve in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology as the business continues to expand and offers greater margins than the equity trading business we expect that our competitors or new entrants into the exchange business may open new options exchanges 

the options exchanges that we compete with set fees to attract multiplylisted options business to their exchanges which has reduced the revenue per contract that we generate from these options fees utilized include both transaction fees assessed to access liquidity and incentive programs to attract order flow order flow particularly customer order flow is the primary driver of multiplylisted options exchange volumes in the past several years the competition for this business has increased significantly due in part to the limited number of firms known as consolidators who make routing decisions based on pricing and their ability to internalize order flow some exchanges have structured their options businesses in partnership with established market participants and order flow providers others offer specific payments for order flow in addition to any economic incentives received from marketmakers and other participants 

regulatory oversight 

we are subject to regulation by the sec and the cftc and market participants may be subject to regulation by the sec the cftc the board of governors of the federal reserve the us department of the treasury andor foreign regulators laws and regulations regarding our business and the business of market participants are frequently modified or changed see regulatory environment and compliance for more information on significant areas of regulation of us as the number of legislative actions have increased such as the implementation of basel iii doddfrank and the collins amendment to doddfrank some market participants have adjusted their businesses 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a global leader and innovator in the options industry we believe we are well positioned to further enhance our leadership position through several key competitive strengths 

 we also connect with a growing customer base through trading and educational resources including the worldrenowned cboe options institute and we recently became the first us options exchange to trade options in nonus trading hours 

 growth strategy

types of products 

 increased flexibility 

over the past few years we have expanded our offerings and experienced increases in our existing offerings that allow for customers to trade options on a number of different time horizons allowing them to pinpoint their preferred timing in addition to standard option terms we also offer options with weekly end of month and end of quarter expirations and provide leaps that allow the user to establish positions that can be maintained for a period of up to fifteen years our weeklys product in particular has seen rapid growth especially in vix and spx we believe that the flexibility provided by these offerings allows us to meet the differing needs of our customers and increase trading volume 

proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility indexes based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the sp 100 the russell 2000 the djia and the nasdaq 100 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and a series of options strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and russell 2000 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indexes we have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense certain indexes the company generates revenue from both the calculation and dissemination of index values and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products including spx options and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for indexes index options and other products in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list certain products based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

  7 

 spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indexes and is considered a bellwether for the u s economy the options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of its status as a bellweather spx is traded in a number of different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices 

  

over the past five years we have seen a significant increase in the number of spx weeklys contracts traded one of our fastest growing products as a percentage of total spx contracts traded spx weeklys has increased from 22 in 2010 to 359 in 2015 we believe that traders are using this product to fine tune the timing of hedging strategies and maximize the risk premium in strategies that involve the sale of options such as covered call writing 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the volatility trading space with its introduction of the cboe volatility index the vix index in 1993 we introduced futures on the vix index in 2004 and options in 2006 the vix index is based on realtime prices of options on the sp 500 index and is designed to reflect investors consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future additionally in 2015 we introduced vix weeklys options and futures to provide investors with new opportunities and tools to trade shortterm volatility 

while the trading volumes in options and futures on the vix index have increased over the past five years trading volumes in these products are especially sensitive to market volatility with increases in volume generally occurring along with spikes in volatility while we believe that there will be continued intrinsic growth in our volatility products significant changes in the levels of market volatility may significantly impact volumes in these products 

in addition to the vix index we offer other products based on the vix methodology including futures on cboe russell 2000 volatility index and the cboecbot 10year us treasury note volatility index cfe also lists futures on realized variance using rivet methodology while volumes in our nonvix options and futures volatility products are not material to us we continue to explore opportunities to expand our volatility product offerings with respect to both new indexes and new asset classes 

ftse russell 

the london stock exchange groups leading global index franchises ftse russell indexes represent a diverse group of domestic and global equities with international appeal the russell indexes include widely followed benchmarks of usbased stocks while the ftse indexes focus primarily on global and emerging markets equity benchmarks that are widely used in the us market ftse russell indexes are among the largest and most widely used by investors in the us and us etfs tracking ftse russell indexes comprise some of the most actively traded globally 

the options we offer on the ftse russell indexes currently the russell 2000 russell 1000 russell 1000 value and russell 1000 growth indexes are exclusive to cboe we launched options on the russell 1000 russell 1000 value and russell 1000 growth indexes in october 2015 enabling investors to target additional segments of the us equity market

market model 

algorithms 

the matching algorithms used on our exchanges are the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants our technology and the rules of our exchanges provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers 

 9 

and sellers we have the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products in order to meet the needs of particular market segments the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

 details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

pricing 

each of our exchanges establishes a fee schedule that among other things sets the transaction fee for buying or selling options or futures contracts on the exchange and access fees for accessing the exchange in our proprietary products we assess these fees on all participants with the amount of the fee based on the market participants role and the origin of the underlying order and subject to discounts based on relative volume or trading strategies in multiplylisted products cboe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees are charged to most professionals including marketmakers but are not charged for most customer orders additionally cboe offers incentive programs to attract customer order flow including certain payments for order flow and our volume incentive program vip which pays credits to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of qualifying customer business at the exchange 

cfe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s trading system or is a block trade cfe also offers a day trade fee program that provides rebates on trades that qualify for the program 

each of the exchanges also currently charges a fee for trading permits that allow access to our exchanges cboe has a sliding scale for all marketmaker trading permits used by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that satisfy certain requirements in our proprietary options classes such as spx vix the sp 100 index and the russell 2000 index 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 264  to 299  annually for 2015  our market share was 271  

in our proprietary products we compete against futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products including spy that offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

the multiplylisted options industry is extremely competitive and the competition has intensified we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the price quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaption and our reputation there are twelve other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors including ise nasdaq omx nom nasdaq omx phlx nyse amex options and nyse arca options 

the options exchanges frequently introduce new pricing models in order to attract additional trades to their exchanges these pricing models include traditional pricing makertaker and ownership benefits see trends  price competition 

our competitive challenge is to persuade brokerdealers to route options orders to our exchanges rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their marketmaking activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on equities and etps we compete through a variety of methods including

 technology 

cboe command 

cboe command our inhouse developed java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and low latency supports trading on all of our exchanges and supports trading nearly 24 hours 5 days a week on cfe our technology supports the trading process from the entering of quotes and orders to matching trades to submitting them to the options clearing corporation occ for clearing the technology supports different products different market models and multiple matching algorithms as well as a fully integrated complex order book and several auction mechanisms as mentioned above cboe is a hybrid exchange while c2 and cfe are fully electronic in the hybrid format cboe command provides features of screenbased and floorbased trading 

the platform supports both a quotedriven options market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations and an orderdriven market model for our futures exchange cboe and c2 marketmakers dpms and lmms typically stream hundreds of millions of quotes into cboe command each day to facilitate liquidity providers cboe command offers a number of internal risk controls including quote lock and quote risk monitor 

cboe command allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products in addition our system facilitates different trading models through the use of alternative configurations allowing us to provide both hybrid and fully electronic market models cboe also offers cflex our hybrid platform for trading flex options built on the cboe command platform 

cboe vector 

in 2015 we began inhouse custom development of cboe vector our next generation of trading technology this new platform is designed to provide streamlined access to a comprehensive array of options and volatility products and to the deep liquid markets in which they trade 

the advanced architecture of the platform is being developed to deliver bestinclass functionality low latency ease of use improved connectivity and trading efficiency the platform is being engineered to provide greatly increased transaction speeds while handling constantly increasing message traffic and industry demand for additional functionality such as risk controls we expect to implement cboe vector for cfe in the third quarter of 2016 with cboe and c2 to follow 

hybrid trading model 

all cboe products trade with an electronic and openoutcry component where both are integrated to function as a single market our hybrid trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe command trading platform for our amsettled spx options certain of the electronic trading features are differently configured to better suit the needs of customers in those products 

in general cboe marketmakers stream their own individual quotes into the cboe trading engine and if on the floor engage in open outcry transactions in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer the best of both electronic and open outcry trading models

occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us options exchanges occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on cfe upon execution of an options or futures trade we transmit to occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes 

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion covers the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions to address perceived problems new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of certain recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

regulation system compliance and integrity reg sci and working group initiatives 

on december 5 2014 the sec adopted a new regulation regulation systems compliance and integrity “reg sci” under the securities exchange act reg sci requires “sci entities” which includes selfregulatory organizations like cboe and c2 to comply as of the compliance date of november 3 2015 with security and capacity requirements with respect to their systems and accompanying compliance procedures as part of complying with reg sci cboe and c2 were required to among other things establish written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a resilient market in the event of a disruption this includes for example each exchange ensuring that it has adequate disaster recovery facilities that are geographically diverse from the exchange’s systems and that facilitate the ability to resume trading within specified timeframes when critical and noncritical sci systems are rendered inoperable it also requires timely and substantial notification to be made to the sec in the event an exchange experiences certain system interruptions or interference the sec has also established various working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency including regarding regulatory halts trade nullification and additional market protections as adopted reg sci and the other sec mandated working group initiatives are very complex and as such compliance with rules may require significant resources 

cftc core principles 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets dcms like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to the new requirements however one aspect with respect to the amended core principles applicable to dcms that remains pending relates to amended core principle 9 core principle 9 requires each dcm to provide a competitive open and efficient market and mechanism for executing transactions that protects the price discovery process of trading in the dcm’s centralized market 

 12 

cftc regulations to implement core principle 9 remain pending and may address the extent to which a dcm may permit block trades and exchanges of derivatives for related positions in its products to occur through the dcm outside of the dcm’s centralized market cfe cannot predict or estimate the extent to which these regulations may affect cfe or its operations 

automated trading 

in november 2015 the cftc issued a rulemaking proposal relating to automated trading on dcms the proposal referred to as regulation automated trading regulation at takes a multilevel approach by proposing risk controls and other requirements for a market participants using algorithmic trading systems atss who are defined as “at persons” in the rulemaking b clearing member futures commission merchants fcms with respect to their at person customers and c dcms executing at person orders 

regulation at is intended to reduce potential risks arising from algorithmic trading activity by requiring the implementation of risk controls such as maximum order message and maximum order size parameters and the establishment of standards for the development testing and monitoring of atss among other requirements at persons and clearing member fcms would also be required to submit reports on their risk controls to dcms and maintain books and records regarding their risk controls and other algorithmic trading procedures for review by dcms regulation at also proposes to require the registration of proprietary traders engaged in algorithmic trading through direct electronic access to a dcm and to require that all at persons become members of a registered futures association regulation at would also require the use of selftrade prevention tools by market participants on dcms while permitting trades originating from accounts with independent decision makers in addition regulation at is intended to foster transparency around dcm electronic trade matching platforms and dcm marketmaker and trading incentive programs 

although cfe may incur additional resources complying with the proposal if it were to be adopted by the cftc cfe does not expect that the proposal will have a material impact on cfe or its operations 

systems safeguards 

in december 2015 the cftc issued a rulemaking proposal to amend its system safeguards rules for dcms by enhancing and clarifying existing provisions relating to system safeguards risk analysis and oversight and cybersecurity testing and adding new provisions concerning certain aspects of cybersecurity testing the proposal clarifies the existing system safeguards rules for dcms by specifying and defining the types of cybersecurity testing required to fulfill system safeguards testing obligations including vulnerability testing penetration testing controls testing security incident response plan testing and enterprise technology risk assessment the proposal also clarifies the categories of risk analysis and oversight that statutorilyrequired programs of system safeguardsrelated risk analysis and oversight must address system safeguardsrelated books and records obligations the scope of system safeguards testing internal reporting and review of testing results and remediation of vulnerabilities and deficiencies cfe does not expect the proposal to result in significant changes to its operations if the proposal were to be adopted by the cftc 

agency rulemaking areas 

in addition to the above identified areas the sec has been directed under doddfrank to implement many new rules both alone and in conjunction with the cftc these areas include portfolio margining and securitybased swap clearing and execution 

the sec has proposed rules including options fee caps and banning flash orders that it has not acted upon while we do not expect the sec to take action with respect to options fee caps or banning flash orders as these proposals are dated if one or both of the proposals were adopted they could cause significant changes to our market that may reduce our revenue per contract or reduce the volume of trading on our exchanges 

compliance 

securities industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organizations sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec cbsx which ceased offering stocks for trading on april 30 2014 is not an sro and was a stock trading facility of cboe as the sro for cbsx cboe was responsible for the regulation of the cbsx marketplace and the following discussion of cboes responsibilities includes the responsibility to provide regulation for cbsx and cboes other facilities in addition nsx is a stock exchange that is an sro and was wholly 

 13 

owned by cbsx until nsx was sold to a third party on february 18 2015 during the time that cbsx owned nsx nsx ceased operating its exchange on may 30 2014 and cboe supported nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities until its sale in 2015 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members known as tphs at cboe and c2 through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of cboes or c2s rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that the cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

consent order 

on june 11 2013 cboe and c2 entered into a consent order with the sec under which cboe and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the securities exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings these undertakings included conducting a review of our regulatory programs enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implementing training programs for employees we have certified to the completion of these undertakings the consent order also requires ongoing certifications by the companys chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer until 2019 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are also subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure fair representation of trading permit holders in the selection of cboe and c2 directors public participation in the governance of cboe and c2 and that cboe and c2 can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of cboe and c2 and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of cboe or c2 relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out 

 14 

their responsibilities under the exchange act to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to cboe and c2 the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the us be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts

exchange act rule 17d2 permits sros to enter into agreements commonly called rule 17d2 agreements which are approved by the sec and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those sros and relating to members those sros have in common we have entered into rule 17d2 agreements under which finra is allocated responsibility for enforcing certain federal securities laws and cboe and c2 rules that are common with finra rules rules related to options sales practices with respect to cboe and c2 trading permit holders and insider trading rules we have entered into other rule 17d2 agreements that allocate responsibility to each sro for ensuring that their allocated common members comply with rules governing expiring exercise declarations options position limits and large options position reporting and position adjustments finally we have entered into a rule 17d2 agreement that allocates certain responsibilities under regulation nms to a market participants dea 

orsa plan 

the sec approved a national market system nms plan named the options regulatory surveillance authority plan orsa plan with the purpose of permitting the us securities options exchanges to act jointly in the administration operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed material information in trading in one or more of their markets through the sharing of the costs of these regulatory activities and the sharing of the regulatory information generated under the orsa plan the orsa plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and the national market system for options and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts the orsa policy committee had delegated the operation of the surveillance and investigative facility contemplated by the orsa plan to cboe the exchanges also entered into a regulatory services agreement with cboe as service provider pursuant to which cboe performed certain regulatory and surveillance functions under the orsa plan and used its automated insider trading surveillance system to perform these functions on behalf of the exchanges effective january 1 2015 the orsa policy committee delegated the operation of the orsa plan facility to finra and finra became the service provider under the regulatory services agreement 

national market system plans 

in addition to the orsa plan described above cboe and c2 are member participants of several other nms plans including the plans that are described below 

opra cta cq plan and nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan 

like all us options exchanges cboe and c2 are member exchanges in opra a limited liability company the opra limited liability company agreement sets forth a system for reporting options information that is administered by the member exchanges through opra consisting of representatives of the member exchanges opra is the designated securities 

 16 

information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchangelisted securities options in the us and it disseminates certain core trading information such as last sale reports and quotations we also participate in the consolidated tape association cta the consolidated quotation plan cq plan and the nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan which perform analogous services for the us equities market nyse technologies formerly the securities industry automation corporation acts as the processor for opra cta and the cq plan nasdaq acts as the processor for the nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan 

options intermarket linkage plan 

we are a party to the options order protection and lockedcrossed market plan known as the options intermarket linkage plan which is designed to facilitate the routing of orders between exchanges in furtherance of a national market system the principal purposes of the plan are to promote price protection and to assure that brokers may execute investors orders at the best market price the national best bid and offer nbbo the plan requires price protection of an exchanges best displayed bid or offer when the bid or offer is at the nbbo under the plan direct exchangetoexchange access through brokerdealers is used to transmit intermarket sweep orders similar to sweep orders that are available in the stock market under regulation nms undisplayed bids and offers and bids and offers at prices that are inferior to an exchanges best bid or offer do not receive protection under this plan 

options listing procedures plan and symbology plan 

we are a party to the options listing procedures plan which sets forth the procedures that the options exchanges must follow to list new options we are also a party to the national market system plan for the selection and reservation of securities symbols 

consolidated audit trail cat 

in 2012 the sec directed the sros through a new regulation to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail cat which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market the regulation requires among other things that upon implementation of a plan data be reported to a central repository the following day by each exchange and brokerdealer we are working with the other sros to develop the plan to implement a consolidated audit trail which is required to detail technological and compliance aspects of the plan and the costs to implement the plan among other details once the plan is finalized and effective there will be a phased implementation over three years the exchanges and their participants are likely to incur significant costs related to the implementation of the consolidated audit trail requirements 

intellectual property 

we own or have rights to a number of intellectual property assets including trademarks service marks domain names trade names copyrights trade secrets and patents while the majority of our intellectual property is protected under us law we have many intellectual property assets protected by laws in europe asia and other parts of the world we license some intellectual property assets to other entities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights while respecting the legitimate intellectual property rights of others

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index the russell 2000 index as well as others granted to us by the owners of such indexes and have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2015  approximately 829  of our transaction fees were generated by our futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products and products based on the vix methodology the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our sp 500 index options and vix index options and futures as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition the european parliament has adopted legislation that will require european exchanges to provide nondiscriminatory access to benchmarks like index options and is considering other legislation that may impact the ability of european banks to trade our products while similar legislation has not been proposed in the us if it were passed it could cause us to lose exclusivity in our internally developed and licensed index products the adopted and proposed european legislation may impact our expansion activities in europe and may reduce the volume on our exchanges from international customers 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to legal or other action taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively license indexes in addition indexes underlying certain of our proprietary products may be licensed for use in otc options options on etfs and etns that have such licenses on these indexes are available for trading as a result trading in our proprietary products could decrease due to competitive pressures from these products 

we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

 19 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options and futures transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the us and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 general economic conditions affect options and futures trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy may have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc see business—regulatory environment and compliance—compliance—securities industrycboe and c2 for information regarding our regulatory responsibilities for cbsx 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra and other sros with respect to our options exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain responsibility for the regulation of our tphs see business—regulatory responsibilities 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and dcms respectively pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient cboe c2 or cfe could be the subject of sec or cftc investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of an exchanges registration as a national securities exchange or dcm any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe c2 or cfe may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the options exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with cboe and c2 see business—regulatory responsibilities

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees and incentives for multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted options contract may decrease it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

like nearly all of the other options exchanges our options exchanges charge an options regulatory fee orf to tphs based on the total number of customer contracts cleared by that tph regardless of the exchange on which the trade is executed along with fines and other regulatory fees the orf revenues may only be used to support our regulatory functions we may face competitive pressures to further reduce or not increase the orfs on our exchanges and if we are unable to maintain or if necessary increase the orfs our results of operation may be adversely affected 

with respect to our proprietary products we compete on price against futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives we also compete on price against certain multiplylisted options products including spy that offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  approximately 719  709  and 694  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including basel iii doddfrank and the collins amendment to doddfrank may cause market participants to reduce the number of trades they make on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis—operating revenues—average revenue per contract if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

 21 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options or futures markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc foreign regulators or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while many of its requirements have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented some of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them 

under the collins amendment to the doddfrank act starting in 2015 us banks are required to use a new approach in order to compute their risk weighted assets which include exchangetraded options and futures this and other rulemaking may lead to further increases in capital requirements for us bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives these increased capital requirements may reduce trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated brokerdealers reducing their own trading charging their customers more to trade or reducing the type or number of customers 

in 2012 the sec directed the sros to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market in addition to increased regulatory obligations implementation of a consolidated audit trail could result in significant additional expenditures including to implement any new technology to meet any plans requirements the sec has also adopted reg sci and established working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency meeting the requirements of reg sci or other regulations or mandates generated by these working groups could result in significant additional expenses including for technology and compliance 

under european union “eu” regulations european banks must take punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a nonqualifying clearinghouse occ our clearinghouse for options and futures and other us clearinghouses are not currently recognized as qualified clearinghouses by the eu the current deadline for the eu to grant equivalence to foreign clearinghouses is june 15 2016 if occ is not recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the eu by june 15 2016 or a subsequent deadline in the event that the current deadline is extended we could experience the loss of a significant number of european market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

in addition congress the sec foreign regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the options or futures industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer comparable products and with the overthecounter market with respect to our proprietary products with respect to our multiplylisted products our principal competitors are the twelve other us options exchanges see the risk factor entitled our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in 

 22 

maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

 the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results would be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as occ and its member clearing firms securities information processors such as the cta and opra regulatory service providers such as finra and nfa the host of our data center and various vendors of communications and networking products and services more specifically 

 we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services or make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

 23 

if one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products may suffer 

we are a party to an increasing number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indexes including license agreements that we have with sp for the sp 500 index and sp 100 index sp dow jones indices llc for the dow jones industrial average lseg for more than two dozen ftse russell indexes including the russell 2000 index and msci inc for six msci indexes including the msci eafe index and msci emerging markets index these license agreements provide among other things that we are authorized to list options on their indexes and some of the resulting index options are among the most actively traded products at cboe the quality and integrity of each of these indexes are dependent on the ability of the index providers to maintain the index including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index and we are dependent on the index providers for a number of things including the provision of index data to us we also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indexes and uses of the indexes that infringe on our licenses as further discussed in risk factor we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights furthermore some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us if any of our index providers are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indexes or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements trading in these products and therefore transaction fees we receive may be adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated 

if we are unable to fulfill our obligations under the consent order it may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

in addition to entering into the consent order and agreeing to complete certain undertakings we may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the sec if the sec were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the consent order see business—regulatory environment and compliance—compliance—consent order any investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index and futures products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 24 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and networks including the systems that comprise cboe command the platform for trading on our exchanges and cboe vector the platform that we are developing that is expected to replace cboe command if we are unable to operate monitor or maintain these systems and networks program them so that they operate correctly and maintain the integrity of their data or successfully transition from the cboe command platform to the new cboe vector platform it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a backup of trading and key corporate systems the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite the enhancements made to our disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all 

with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems our communications networks and the systems of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access including the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information malware and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control if our security measures are inadequate or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches and to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and may suffer harm to our reputation and litigation measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the confidentiality integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 25 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees accounted for 84  of our operating revenues in 2015  cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our policies and procedures designed to meet those compliance responsibilities as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed or that our compliance and internal audit functions would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

misconduct by our tphs or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our tphs other persons who use our markets or our employees may engage in fraud market manipulation or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct or market manipulation and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct or market manipulation by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business the failure to retain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy additionally effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees especially those who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business 

 26 

in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems errors consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

over the past five years we have experienced significantly increased volume on our futures exchange extended trading hours on our futures exchange and in spx and vix options and developed several proprietary products we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology legal accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins will be adversely affected 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe our futures exchange the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and a variety of threat actors have specifically targeted the financial services industry at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any material cases of data theft corruption or destruction of data or compromised customer data security breaches may among other consequences lead to increased scrutiny by our regulators and have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets legislation has been proposed for the implementation of a transaction tax further proposals may include modifications to the taxation of financial products including repealing the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income requiring all derivatives to be markedtomarket and eliminating the exemption for qualified covered calls if such proposals a transaction tax or other tax change that detrimentally impacts options or futures trading were to become law they could have a negative impact on the options and futures industry and us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading 

 27 

in 2015 the internal revenue service issued and proposed new regulations under section 871m that require dividend tax withholding for certain transactions completed by foreign persons unless substantive changes are made to the regulations there may be a significant reduction in trading by foreign persons either by their choice or due to brokers refusing to trade options for such persons 

in addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants there has been a trend toward states changing the income tax laws to increase the apportionment factors on which state income taxes are based and becoming more aggressive asserting nexus over corporations that are not domiciled in the state if state income tax laws change or if states are successful asserting nexus against us we may become subject to income taxes in additional states or at a higher rate in the states where income tax filing requirements exists if this occurs we may experience a higher effective state tax rate 

we selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

we selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

in 2015 we acquired the market data services and trading analytics platforms of livevol inc we and environmental financial products llc launched the american financial exchange an electronic marketplace for small and midsized banks to lend and borrow shortterm funds and in early 2016 we made a majority equity investment in vest financial group inc an investment advisor that provides optionscentric products 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or and unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 

 in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 28 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2015  the end of the period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 

the company reviews its legal proceedings and claims regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions the company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading the company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote the companys assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals 

as of december 31 2015  the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these reviews inspections or other legal proceedings if any has been incurred while the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on our earnings in any given reporting period however in the opinion of management the ultimate liability is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or capital resources

business highlights 

 business strategy 

we believe that the derivatives industry especially the listed options and futures industry has significant growth potential including through new participants and products we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

  35 

 components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fees transaction fees are a function of many variables with the main three being 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume mix products traded and 3 transaction mix between order type because transaction fees are assessed on a per contract basis transaction fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are influenced by a number of factors including price competition price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis the main products we trade are equity index and etp options and futures contracts 

 access fees 

access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit and privilege holders for the opportunity to trade including fees for tradingrelated functionality on cboe c2 and cfe the cboe program contains a tierbased marketmaker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and in the case of marketmakers the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products beginning in mid2013 cboe implemented sliding scales for all marketmaker and floor broker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used in any options classes other than certain proprietary indexes the number of trading permits made available is limited 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand also included in this category are the market data services and trading analytics platforms of livevol which we acquired in august 2015 

 36 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and primarily through our subsidiary market data express llc mdx through mdx we sell historical options data as well as realtime data for certain proprietary products and indexes it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets a highavailability low latency streaming data feed opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges including cboe and c2 authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter opra is not consolidated with the company 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as selfregulatory organizations under the exchange act regulatory fees include an options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industrywide customer volume of trading permit holders and designated examining authority fees for certain trading permit holders this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holders declines and rates are not increased or are decreased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease 

the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions some of which are included in this revenue category and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses mainly in compensation and benefits in 2014 and professional fees and outside services in 2015 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement with the finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets additionally cboe entered into a separate agreement with finra under which it assigned to finra the responsibility to perform regulatory services for the options regulatory surveillance authority orsa finra began performing the services on january 1 2015 

other revenue 

the following subcategories are the sources of revenue within this category 

 components of operating expenses 

most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except royalty fees and order routing 

compensation and benefits 

compensation and benefits are our most significant expense and include salaries and benefits stockbased compensation incentive compensation severance and employer taxes salaries and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to equity awards stockbased compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period 

depreciation and amortization 

 37 

depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

technology support services 

technology support services expense consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture circuits supporting our wide area network support for production software fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and offsite system hosting fees 

professional fees and outside services 

professional fees and outside services consist primarily of consulting services which include the supplementation of staff for activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance legal regulatory and audit and tax advisory services 

royalty fees 

royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid for the use of underlying indexes in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded the company has licenses with the owners of the sp 500 index sp 100 index and certain other sp indexes the djia the nasdaq 100 msci and the ftse russell indexes this category also includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to sp indexes and in prior years certain fees paid to market participants for order flow that they directed or caused to be directed to our exchanges 

order routing 

order routing consists of market linkage expenses incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges if a competing exchange quotes a better price we route the customers order to that exchange and pay certain of the associated costs regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our options exchanges the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers 

travel and promotional expenses 

travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising costs for special events sponsorship of industry conferences options education seminars and travel related expenses 

facilities costs 

facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent maintenance utilities real estate taxes and telecommunications costs 

other expenses 

other expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations but are not included in the above categories 

other incomeexpense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating and are classified as other incomeexpense these activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash dividend income and equity earnings or losses from our investments in other business ventures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the 

 38 

application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

 income taxes 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the company files tax returns for federal state and local income tax purposes a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 

if the company considers that a tax position is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position it recognizes the tax benefit the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position to the extent that the companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months interest and penalties if any are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the companys consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers this standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance in addition the asu provides guidance on accounting for certain revenuerelated costs including when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract asu 201409 provides companies with two implementation methods companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective application or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application modified retrospective application this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted the fasb deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date early adoption of the standard is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within those annual periods the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu201516 business combinations this standard simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination first it requires that the acquirer recognize 

 39 

adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined the acquirer also should record in the same periods financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date the amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified after december 15 2015 and that are within the measurement period upon transition an entity would be required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle an entity would provide that disclosure in the first annual period of adoption and in the interim periods within the first annual period the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets statements of income comprehensive income or cash flows   

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu201517 income taxes balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this standard affects only entities that present a classified statement of financial position deferred tax liabilities and assets will be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position and the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount remains the same notably asu no 201517 aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with international accounting standard 1 presentation of financial statements which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position for public business entities asu no 201517 is effective for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period for all other entities asu no 201517 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods in annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 entities are required to apply the proposed amendments prospectively to all deferred income tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented we decided to early adopt this standard on a retrospective basis for the period ended december 31 2015 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet

transaction fees increased   42  to 4560 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  representing 719  of total operating revenues compared with 4378 million  for the prior year period or 709  of total operating revenues this increase was largely driven by a 176   increase  in the average revenue per contract partially offset by an 114   decrease  in trading volume the increase in average revenue per contract resulted primarily from a shift in volume mix of products traded fee changes implemented in 2015 and lower volume discounts and incentives as a percent of total trading volume index options and futures contracts which generate our highest options and overall average revenue per contract respectively accounted for 392  of trading volume for the year ended december 31 2015  up from 345  during the same period in 2014  

average revenue per contract discussed in more detail below is impacted by our fee structure which includes volume based incentive programs mix of products traded the account type customer firm marketmaker etc and the manner in which a trade is executed the implementation of fee changes which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges we cannot predict the trading patterns of exchange participants which may be based on factors outside our control but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market 

trading volume is impacted by many factors including macroeconomic events market volatility regulatory actions or considerations availability of capital competition and pricing

factors contributing to the change in total average revenue per contract for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  included 

 

  42 

access fees 

access fees for the year ended december 31 2015   decreased  to 533 million  from 593 million  in the comparable prior year period the decrease in access fees was primarily due to a reduction in the number of trading permits 

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2015   increased   110  to 422 million  from 380 million  in the comparable period in the prior year the increase was primarily a result of higher fees for technology services and revenue generated from livevol which was acquired on august 7 2015 

in 2016 we expect exchange services and other fees to be higher as a result of the recognition of a full year of revenue generated by livevol 

market data fees 

market data fees decreased   14  to 300 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 304 million  in the prior year for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  income derived from our market data services totaled 160 million  and 154 million  respectively and opra income totaled 140 million  and 150 million  respectively revenue generated from our market data services which provide current and historical options and futures data increased 06 million  resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers and fees for certain market data services income derived from opra is allocated based on each exchanges share of total cleared options transactions the companys share of total cleared options transactions for the period ended december 31 2015  decreased to 233  from 249  for the same period in 2014  and total distributable opra income decreased compared to the prior year period resulting in lower revenue for the period ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees decreased   97  for the year ended 2015  to 335 million  from 371 million  in the same period in the prior year the decrease in regulatory fees was primarily the result of lower options regulatory fees and a decrease in regulatory fees received for other regulatory services 

regulatory fees are primarily generated by the options regulatory fee that we charge on all trading permit holder customer volume industrywide which decreased compared to the prior period and a decrease in regulatory fees received for other regulatory services primarily related to cboe stock exchange llc cbsx which ceased trading operations on april 30 2014 

under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

other revenue 

other revenue increased 49 million  for the year ended 2015  to 195 million  from 146 million  in the same period in the prior year the increase in other revenue was primarily due to higher regulatory fines assessed for disciplinary actions and the recognition of revenue to adjust for incorrect coding of transactions by an exchange participant related to prior periods 

concentration of revenue   

all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of occ at december 31 2015  there were one hundred thirteen  trading permit holders that are clearing members of occ two clearing members accounted for 45  of transaction and other fees collected through occ in 2015  the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 12  of transaction and other fees collected through occ no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing member firms represented more than 27  of transaction and other fees collected through occ for the respective clearing member in 2015  should a clearing member withdraw from cboe we believe the trading permit holder portion of that clearing members trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing member 

the two largest clearing members mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe c2 and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including ours 

operating expenses

depreciation and amortization increased  by 64 million  to 463 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with 399 million  for the same period in 2014  the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from capital spending to harden and enhance our trading platform and operations and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets that have a shorter than expected useful life

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or decline since transactions on our exchanges are not governed by longterm contracts we believe that any increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on us

history

restructuring transaction 

on june 18 2010 cboe converted from a nonstock corporation owned by its members into a stock corporation that is a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe holdings in the restructuring transaction each cboe regular membership an exchange seat owned by a cboe member on june 18 2010 converted into 80000 shares of class a common stock of cboe holdings seat owners received a total of 74400000 shares of class a common stock of cboe holdings in the restructuring transaction in addition certain persons who satisfied the qualification requirements set forth in the settlement agreement in the delaware action received a total of 16333380 shares of class b common stock of cboe holdings on june 18 2010 pursuant to the settlement agreement qualifying members of the plaintiff class received a cash payment of 3000 million 

the initial public offering of 13455000 shares of unrestricted common stock including 2085774 shares of unrestricted common stock sold by selling stockholders for a price of 2900 per share was completed on june 18 2010 net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriters fees and commissions and other related expenses were 3012 million costs directly associated with the companys initial public offering were recorded as a reduction of the gross proceeds received in arriving at the amount recorded in additional paidin capital 

upon consummation of the initial public offering the shares of class a and class b common stock not converted into unrestricted common stock and sold in the initial public offering automatically converted into 44323803 shares of class a1 common stock and 44323803 shares of class a2 common stock the company conducted tender offers in november 2010 and purchased 12017895 shares of class a1 and class a2 common stock on december 15 2010 and june 13 2011 respectively each remaining share of class a1 and class a2 common stock issued and outstanding converted into one share of unrestricted common stock as a result as of december 31 2011 no shares of class a1 or class a2 common stock were outstanding 

industry 

our primary business of offering exchangetraded options and futures contracts on financial instruments is part of the large and growing global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset or reference value while derivatives exist on a wide range of underlying assets and references we currently focus on offering derivatives products on individual stocks stock indexes exchangetraded funds exchangetraded notes interest rates and various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset most options traded on us securities exchanges and overthecounter are on individual equities market indexes and etps 

futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that are settled by the delivery of the underlying asset or in cash by reference to the underlying asset or reference at a specified price and on a specified future date futures on cfe are settled in cash options on futures may also be listed for trading on futures exchanges 

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3600 underlying stocks indexes and etps among other products the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including marketmakers is a key feature of the options market marketmakers collectively provide continuous bids and offers for all listed options series over the past decade trading in the options market has migrated from being primarily conducted facetoface or open outcry to being primarily electronic as a result many liquidity providers now operate remotely away from the physical trading floors and the majority of options trading volume is handled and executed electronically 

trends 

increased interest in our proprietary products 

our proprietary products are those in which we have a property right or for which we have an exclusive license and contribute almost all of our transaction fee revenues for index options and all of our transaction fee revenues for futures listed options on equities and etps currently may be listed on all options exchanges while trading in our proprietary products is limited to our exchanges thus our proprietary products are able to support a higher revenue per contract than multiplylisted products 

 4 

over the past five years average daily volume adv in our index options has increased from 107  million contracts to 161  million contracts and adv in our futures has increased from 17  thousand contracts to 201  thousand contracts the increase in index options and futures trading significantly outpaced the growth in the industry and multiplylisted products in this timeframe these increases are primarily due to increased interest in trading our vix options and futures and spx options see spx options and volatility trading 

price competition 

exchanges set fees to attract multiplylisted options business to their exchanges which has reduced the revenue per contract that we generate from these options fees utilized include both transaction fees assessed to access liquidity and incentive programs to attract order flow order flow particularly customer order flow is the primary driver of multiplylisted options exchange volumes in the past several years the competition for this business has increased significantly due in part to the limited number of firms known as consolidators who make routing decisions based on pricing and their ability to internalize order flow some exchanges have structured their options businesses in partnership with established market participants and order flow providers others offer specific payments for order flow in addition to any economic incentives received from marketmakers and other participants 

in addition the number of options exchanges has doubled over the past ten years from six exchanges to twelve in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology as the business continues to expand and offer greater margins than the equity trading business we expect that our competitors or new entrants into the exchange business may open additional new options exchanges 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a global leader and innovator in the options industry we believe we are well positioned to further enhance our leadership position through several key competitive strengths 

 growth strategy 

we believe that the listed options and futures industry especially with respect to volatility trading has significant growth potential including through new participants and products we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

  5 

 in addition through a set of arrangements with sp opco llc sp we permit sp to license the companys proprietary indexes and index methodologies for certain purposes to securities firms and other exchanges the company and sp have agreed that sp may license one or more clearing agencies to clear overthecounter or otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction 

 products 

our exchanges provide a marketplace for the trading of options and futures contracts that meet criteria established in the rules of the respective exchange the options contracts listed for trading include options on indexes equities and etps in addition we provide a marketplace for trading futures contracts through cfe 

types of products 

 increased flexibility 

over the past few years we have expanded our offerings and experienced increases in our existing offerings that allow for customers to trade options on a number of different time horizons allowing them to pinpoint their preferred timing in addition to standard option terms we also offer options with weekly end of month and end of quarter expirations and provide leaps that allow the user to establish positions that can be maintained for a period of up to fifteen years our weeklys product in particular has seen rapid growth especially in spx we believe that the flexibility provided by these offerings allows us to meet the differing needs of our customers and increase trading volume 

 6 

proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility indexes based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and a series of options strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes in addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indexes we have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense certain indexes the company generates revenue from both the calculation and dissemination of index values and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

these proprietary products are built both through our inhouse research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers the following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products spx and vix options and futures 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for indexes index options and other products in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list certain products based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

 spx options 

the sp 500 index is an index comprised of 500 largecap us listed companies it is one of the most commonly followed indexes and is considered a bellwether for the u s economy the options we offer on the sp 500 index are exclusive to cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees because of its status as a bellweather spx is traded in a number of different trading strategies by customers with different goals including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using riskmanaged strategies to capture socalled “risk premia” embedded in option prices 

we are also seeing a significant increase in the number of customers who are trading spx weeklys one of our fastest growing products as a percentage of total spx contracts traded spx weeklys has increased from 22 in 2010 to 307 in 2014 we believe that these traders are using this product to fine tune the timing of hedging strategies and maximize the risk premium in strategies that involve the sale of options such as covered call writing 

 7 

volatility trading 

cboe pioneered the volatility trading space with its introduction of the cboe volatility index the vix index in 1993 we introduced futures on the vix index in 2004 and options in 2006 the vix index is based on realtime prices of options on the sp 500 index and is designed to reflect investors consensus view of future 30day expected stock market volatility since we started offering these products we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies including hedging extreme stock market declines also known as “tail risk” hedging and riskmanaged strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future 

while the trading volumes in options and futures on the vix index have rapidly increased over the past five years trading volumes in these products are especially sensitive to market volatility with increases in volume generally occurring along with spikes in volatility while we believe that there will be continued intrinsic growth in our volatility products significant changes in the levels of market volatility may significantly impact volumes in these products 

in addition to the vix index we offer other products based on the vix methodology including futures on cboe russell 2000 volatility index and the cboecbot 10year us treasury note volatility index cfe also lists futures on realized variance using rivets® methodology while volumes in our nonvix options and futures volatility products are not material to us we continue to explore opportunities to expand our volatility product offerings with respect to both new indexes and new asset classes 

options exchanges market participants 

as discussed in more detail below our options exchanges are designed to provide reliable orderly liquid and efficient marketplaces for the trading of options by market participants our options exchanges operate quotedriven auction markets that involve a number of different market participants 

trading permit holders 

purchasing a monthly trading permit for the respective exchange conveys trading permit holder status on that exchange to the permit holder 

a trading permit holder tph on one of our options exchanges is allowed to enter orders and quotes into the trading system for that exchange trading permit holder entities can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other permit holders or for the accounts of customers 

applicants for trading permit holder status 

applicants for trading permit holder status must have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of a trading permit holder all trading permit holders must abide by the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange the provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the sec 

participant roles 

a trading permit entitles the holder to conduct business on the exchange including in one of the participant roles described below 

 

  8 

 cfe market participants 

parties are required to apply and be approved as cfe trading privilege holders and obtain a cfe trading permit in order to have trading privileges on cfe trading privilege holders on cfe are allowed to enter orders into cfes trading system and can execute trades for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers 

under its rules cfe has the authority to establish marketmaker programs and appoint one or more dpms lmms or marketmakers however cfe does not have a dpm lmm or marketmaker program in vix futures 

market model 

algorithms 

the matching algorithms used on our exchanges are the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants our technology and the rules of our exchanges provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers we have the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products in order to meet the needs of particular market segments the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

 options orders can be routed to other marketplaces via contracted brokers for execution if a better displayed price exists elsewhere see regulatory responsibilities  options intermarket linkage plan details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

pricing 

each of our exchanges establishes a fee schedule that among other things sets the transaction fee for buying or selling options or futures contracts on the exchange and access fees for accessing the exchange in our proprietary products we assess these fees on all participants with the amount of the fee based on the market participants role and the origin of the underlying order and subject to discounts based on relative volume or trading strategies in multiplylisted products cboe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees are charged to most professionals including marketmakers but are not charged for most customer orders additionally cboe offers incentive programs to attract customer order flow including certain payments for order flow and our volume incentive program or vip which pays credits to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of qualifying customer business at the exchange 

cfe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s trading system or is a block trade or exchange of contract for a related position transaction cfe also offers a day trade fee program that provides rebates on trades that qualify for the program 

each of the exchanges also currently charges a fee for trading permits that allow access to our exchanges cboe has a sliding scale for all marketmaker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used for appointments in any options classes other than spx 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 264  to 299  annually for 2014  our market share was 299  

in our proprietary products we compete against futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives we also compete against certain multiplylisted options products include spy that offer some of the features of our proprietary products 

 9 

the multiplylisted options industry is extremely competitive and the competition has intensified we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the price quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaption and our reputation there are ten other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors including ise nasdaq omx nom nasdaq omx phlx nyse amex and nyse arca 

the options exchanges frequently introduce new pricing models in order to attract additional trades to their exchanges these pricing models include traditional pricing makertaker and ownership benefits see trends  price competition 

our competitive challenge is to persuade brokerdealers to route options orders to our exchanges rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their marketmaking activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on equities and etps we compete through a variety of methods including 

 technology 

cboe command 

cboe command our inhouse developed java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and low latency supports trading on all of our exchanges and supports trading nearly 24 hours 5 days a week on cfe our technology supports the trading process from the entering of quotes and orders to matching trades to submitting them to occ for clearing the technology supports different products different market models and multiple matching algorithms as well as a fully integrated complex order book and several auction mechanisms as mentioned above cboe is a hybrid exchange while c2 and cfe are fully electronic in the hybrid format cboe command provides features of screenbased and floorbased trading 

the platform supports both a quotedriven options market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations and an orderdriven market model for our futures exchange cboe and c2 marketmakers dpms and lmms typically stream hundreds of millions of quotes into cboe command each day to facilitate liquidity providers cboe command offers a number of internal risk controls including quote lock and quote risk monitor 

cboe command allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products in addition our system facilitates different trading models through the use of alternative configurations allowing us to provide both hybrid and fully electronic market models cboe also offers cflex our hybrid platform for trading flex options built on the cboe command platform 

hybrid trading model 

all cboe products trade with an electronic and openoutcry component where both are integrated to function as a single market our hybrid trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe command trading platform for our amsettled spx options certain of the electronic trading features are differently configured to better suit the needs of customers in those products 

in general cboe marketmakers stream their own individual quotes into the cboe trading engine and if on the floor engage in open outcry transactions in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer the best of both electronic and open outcry trading models 

 10 

market data 

market data is sent to the options price reporting authority opra our tphs cboe financial network and cboe streaming markets csm described below our exchanges generate valuable information regarding the prices of our products and the trading activity in our exchanges for options market data relating to price and size of market quotations and the price and size of trades is collected and consolidated by opra opra disseminates the information for a fee to vendors who redistribute the data to brokers investors and other persons or entities that use our markets or that monitor general market conditions after costs are deducted the fees collected are distributed among opras exchange participants based on their cleared transactions pursuant to the opra plan as of december 2014  our market data was displayed on approximately 144000 terminals worldwide see regulatory environment and compliance for further information on opra 

our subsidiary market data express llc mdx sells historical options data and realtime data index values it also provides market data through csm a proprietary streaming data feed in 2014 we enhanced csms offerings to include market depth 

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities that essentially replicate the systems available in our primary data center for cboe and cfe we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we continue to work to improve both the availability of our systems and our disaster recovery facilities including through simulation testing 

clearing system 

the occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us options exchanges upon execution of an options trade we transmit to the occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes the occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on cfe 

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion covers the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions to address perceived problems new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of certain recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

regulation system compliance and integrity reg sci and working group initiatives 

on december 5 2014 the sec adopted a new regulation regulation systems compliance and integrity “reg sci” under the securities exchange act reg sci will require “sci entities” which includes selfregulatory organizations like cboe and c2 to comply with security and capacity requirements with respect to their systems and accompanying compliance procedures the regulation will replace and codify the current automation review policy prior to the november 2015 compliance date cboe and c2 will be required to among other things establish written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that their systems have adequate integrity to ensure a resilient market in the event of a disruption this includes for example each exchange ensuring that it has adequate disaster recovery facilities that are geographically diverse from the exchange’s systems and that facilitate the ability to resume trading within specified timeframes when critical and noncritical sci systems are rendered inoperable it also requires timely and substantial notification to be made to the sec in the event an exchange experiences any system interruption or interference the sec has also established various working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency including regarding regulatory halts trade nullification and additional market protections as adopted reg sci and the other sec mandated working group initiatives are very complex and as such compliance with rules may require significant resources 

 11 

consolidated audit trail cat 

in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory organizations or sros through a new regulation to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail cat which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market the regulation requires among other things that upon implementation of a plan data be reported to a central repository the following day by each exchange and broker dealer we are working with the other sros to develop the plan to implement a consolidated audit trail which is required to detail technological and compliance aspects of the plan and the costs to implement the plan among other details the sros have submitted a plan but further revisions to the plan are anticipated once the plan is finalized and effective there will be a phased implementation over three years the exchanges and their participants are likely to incur significant costs related to the implementation of the consolidated audit trail requirements 

cftc core principles 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets dcms like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act in 2012 the cftc adopted a number of new regulations applicable to dcms in order to implement the amended core principles these regulations related to among other things compliance with rules prevention of market disruption financial integrity of transactions disciplinary procedures system safeguards and financial resources as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to these new requirements 

one aspect with respect to the amended core principles applicable to dcms that remains pending relates to amended core principle 9 core principle 9 requires each dcm to provide a competitive open and efficient market and mechanism for executing transactions that protects the price discovery process of trading in the dcm’s centralized market cftc regulations to implement core principle 9 remain pending and may address the extent to which a dcm may permit block trades and exchanges of derivatives for related positions in its products to occur through the dcm outside of the dcm’s centralized market cfe cannot predict or estimate the extent to which these regulations may affect cfe or its operations 

risk controls 

in 2013 the cftc issued a concept release that sought public comment regarding a series of existing and potential pretrade risk controls post trade reports and other posttrade measures system safeguards related to the design testing and supervision of automated trading systems and additional protections designed to promote safe and orderly markets the concept release was intended to serve as a platform for cataloguing existing industry practices determining their efficacy and implementation to date and evaluating the need for additional measures if any the concept release did not include any proposed new regulations but could lead to the proposal by the cftc of additional regulations in this regard that could impact cfe or its operations 

agency rulemaking areas 

in addition to the above identified areas the sec has been directed under doddfrank to implement many new rules both alone and in conjunction with the cftc these areas include portfolio margining and securitybased swap clearing and execution 

the sec has proposed rules including options fee caps and banning flash orders that it has not acted upon while we do not expect the sec to take action with respect to options fee caps or banning flash orders as these proposals are dated if one or both of the proposals were adopted they could cause significant changes to our market that may reduce our revenue per contract or reduce the volume of trading on our exchanges 

compliance 

securities industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organization sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec cbsx which ceased offering stocks for trading on april 30 2014 is not an sro and was a stock trading facility of cboe as the sro for cbsx cboe is responsible for the regulation of the cbsx marketplace and the following discussion of cboes responsibilities includes the responsibility to provide regulation for cbsx and cboes other facilities in addition national stock exchange inc nsx is a stock exchange that is a selfregulatory organization and was wholly owned by cbsx until it was sold to a third party on february 18 2015 nsx 

 12 

ceased operating its exchange on may 30 2014 cboe supported nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities during the time that cbsx owned nsx 

sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members known as tphs at cboe and c2 through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the securities exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time these risks and uncertainties however are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our right to exclusively list certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and the djia granted to us by the owners of such indexes and have developed our proprietary vix methodology in 2014  approximately 818  of our transaction fees were generated by our futures and index options the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusivelylicensed products and products based on the vix methodology the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our sp 500 index options and vix index options and futures as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses if we are unable to retain our proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing or loss of the ability to offer these products for trading which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition the european parliament has adopted legislation that requires european exchanges to provide nondiscriminatory access to benchmarks like index options and is considering other legislation that may impact the ability of european banks to trade our products while similar legislation has not been proposed in the united states if it were passed it could cause us to lose our property rights in our internally developed and licensed index products the adopted and proposed european legislation may limit our ability to expand our activities in europe while retaining our property rights and may reduce the volume on our exchanges from international customers 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to legal or other action taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively license indexes 

we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition especially with respect to transaction fees the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which 

 18 

allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees for multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted options contract has decreased from 0143  in 2012 to 0092  in 2014 it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them 

like nearly all of the other options exchanges our options exchanges charge an options regulatory fee or orf to trading permit holders based on the total number of customer contracts cleared by that trading permit holder regardless of the exchange on which the trade is executed along with fines and other regulatory fees the orf revenues may only be used to support our regulatory functions we may face competitive pressures to further reduce or not increase the orfs on our exchanges and if we are unable to maintain or if necessary increase the orfs our results of operation may be adversely affected 

we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec cfe is a dcm registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc see business  compliance  securities industry  cboe and c2 for information regarding our ongoing regulatory responsibilities for cbsx 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which finra and other sros with respect to our options exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain responsibility for the regulation of our trading permit holders see business  regulatory responsibilities 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and dcms respectively pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of an exchanges registration as a national securities exchange any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe or c2 may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with cboe and c2 see regulatory environment and compliance—regulatory responsibilities 

if we are unable to execute the undertakings in the consent order it may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

on june 11 2013 cboe and c2 entered into the consent order with the sec under which cboe and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the securities exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings these undertakings included conducting a review of our regulatory programs 

 19 

enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implementing training programs for employees the consent order also requires ongoing certifications by cboe and c2s chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer for five years 

we may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the sec if the sec were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the consent order any investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2014  2013  and 2012  approximately 709  694  and 697  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 over the past few years a number of legislative actions have been taken both domestically and internationally that may cause our customers including market makers to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens these actions including basel iii doddfrank and the collins amendment to doddfrank may cause customers to reduce the number of trades they make on our exchanges 

in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis  operating revenues  average revenue per contract if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while many of its requirements have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented some of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them 

under the collins amendment to the doddfrank act starting in 2015 us banks are required to use a new approach in order to compute their risk weighted assets which include exchangetraded options and futures this is expected to increase the capital requirements for us bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives these increased capital requirements may reduce trading in options and futures due to bankaffiliated brokerdealers reducing their own trading charge their customers more to trade or reducing the type or number of customers 

in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory organizations to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market in addition to increased regulatory obligations implementation of a consolidated audit trail could result in significant additional expenditures including to implement any new technology to meet any plans requirements the sec has also adopted regulation systems compliance and integrity reg sci and established working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency meeting the requirements of reg 

 20 

sci or other regulations or mandates generated by these working groups could result in significant additional expenses including for technology and compliance 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

in addition congress the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the options or futures industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer comparable products and with the overthecounter market with respect to our proprietary products with respect to our multiplylisted products our principal competitors are the ten other us options exchanges see the risk factor our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

 the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results would be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 21 

we depend on a number of service providers including clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms securities information processors such as the consolidated tape association and opra regulatory service providers such as finra and nfa the host of our data center and various vendors of communications and networking products and services more specifically 

 we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services or make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index and futures products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as others have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and networks including the systems that comprise cboe command the platform for trading on our exchanges if we are unable to operate monitor or maintain these systems and networks or program them so that they operate correctly and maintain the integrity of their data it could have a material 

 22 

adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a complete backup of cboe and cfe the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite the enhancements made to our disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all 

in addition we have extended the trading hours on cfe for vix futures and expect to extend the trading hours in 2015 for certain products on cboe with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems our communications networks and the systems of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access including the improper access of personally identifiable information malware and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control if our security measures are inadequate or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures including to protect against threatened breaches and to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach and may suffer harm to our reputation and litigation measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the confidentiality integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options and futures transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 23 

 general economic conditions affect options and futures trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy may have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees account for a significant portion of our operating revenues  96  in 2014  cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities we are responsible for disciplining tphs for violating our rules including by imposing fines and sanctions this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws and sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our policies and procedures designed to meet those compliance responsibilities as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed or that our compliance and internal audit functions would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business the failure to retain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees especially those who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly 

 24 

technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems errors consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

over the past five years we have demutualized launched a second options exchange experienced significantly increased volume on our futures exchange and extended trading hours on our futures exchange and plan to extend trading hours in spx and vix options we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and may need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins will be adversely affected 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe our futures exchange the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and various groups have specifically targeted the financial services industry due to its perceived role in the economic and political climate at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any cases of data theft corruption or destruction of data or compromised customer data security breaches may have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose market participants experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

misconduct by our tphs or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our trading permit holders other persons who use our markets or our employees may engage in fraud or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and 

 25 

detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

legislation has been proposed both domestically and internationally that could change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets the proposals include modifications to the taxation of financial products including repealing the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income requiring all derivatives to be markedtomarket eliminating the exemption for qualified covered calls and the implementation of a transaction tax if the proposed tax law changes a transaction tax or other tax change that detrimentally impacts options or futures trading were to become law they could have a negative impact on the options and futures industry and us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading 

the irs has proposed new regulations under section 871m that may require dividend tax withholding for a significant number of transactions completed by foreign persons if the proposed regulations are adopted or unless significant changes are made to the regulations there may be a significant reduction in trading by foreign persons either by their choice or due to brokers refusing to trade options for such persons 

in addition to proposed tax changes that would affect our market participants states are currently modifying the apportionment factors on which the taxes are based and are becoming more aggressive at asserting nexus over corporations that are not domiciled in the state if these state tax laws change or if states are successful at asserting nexus against us we may be subject to taxes in additional states or at a higher amount in the states in which we operate if this occurs we may experience a higher marginal state tax rate 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect us 

we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

 26 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that shareholders might find favorable including discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control or and unsolicited acquisition proposals for us these include provisions 

 in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2014  the end of the period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 

the company reviews its legal proceedings and claims regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions the company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading the company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote the companys assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals 

 27 

as of december 31 2014  the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these reviews inspections or other legal proceedings if any has been incurred while the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on our earnings in any given reporting period however in the opinion of management the ultimate liability is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position liquidity or capital resources

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements see risk factors and forwardlooking statements above 

overview 

cboe holdings inc is the holding company for chicago board options exchange incorporated cboe futures exchange llc c2 options exchange incorporated and other subsidiaries 

the companys principal business is operating markets that offer for trading options on various market indexes index options mostly on an exclusive basis and futures contracts as well as on nonexclusive multiplylisted options such as options on the stocks of individual corporations equity options and options on other exchangetraded products etp options such as exchangetraded funds etf options and exchangetraded notes etn options the company operates three standalone exchanges but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment 

cboe is our primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single exchange is known as our hybrid trading model cfe our allelectronic futures exchange offers trading of futures on the vix index and other products c2 is our allelectronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options and may operate with a different market model and fee structure than cboe all of our exchanges operate on our proprietary technology platform known as cboe command 

business trends 

 business strategy 

we believe that the derivatives industry especially the listed options and futures industry has significant growth potential including through new participants and products we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

  33 

 components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fees transaction fees are a function of many variables with the main three being 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume mix products traded and 3 transaction mix between order type because transaction fees are assessed on a per contract basis transaction fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are influenced by a number of factors including price competition price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis the main products we trade are equity index and etp options and futures contracts 

 the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the increasing use of options represents a longterm trend that will continue in the future furthermore we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the overthecounter market to exchanges 

while there is no certainty we expect that the industrywide and companyspecific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes however additional factors may arise that could also impact trading volume which may result in increases or decreases in our trading volume such as new or existing competition or other events considering these factors we do not expect past trading volumes to be an indicator of future trading volume 

access fees 

access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit holders for the opportunity to trade including fees for tradingrelated functionality on cboe c2 and cfe the cboe program contains a tierbased marketmaker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and in the case of marketmakers the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products beginning in mid2013 cboe implemented sliding scales for all marketmaker and floor broker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used in any options classes other than certain proprietary indexes the number of trading permits made available is limited 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand 

 34 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and primarily through our subsidiary market data express llc mdx through mdx we sell historical options data as well as realtime data for certain proprietary products and indexes it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets a highavailability low latency streaming data feed opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges including cboe and c2 authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter opra is not consolidated with the company 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as selfregulatory organizations under the exchange act regulatory fees include an options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industrywide customer volume of trading permit holders and designated examining authority fees for certain trading permit holders this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holders declines and rates are not increased or are decreased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease 

the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions some of which are included in this revenue category and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses mainly in employee costs and outside services 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets additionally cboe entered into a separate agreement with finra under which it assigned to finra the responsibility to perform regulatory services for the options regulatory surveillance authority orsa finra began performing the services on january 1 2015 

other revenue 

the following subcategories are the sources of revenue within this category 

 components of operating expenses 

most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except royalty fees and trading volume incentives 

employee costs 

employee costs are our most significant expense and include salaries and benefits stockbased compensation incentive compensation severance and employer taxes salaries and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to equity awards stockbased compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period 

depreciation and amortization 

 35 

depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

data processing 

data processing expense consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture circuits supporting our wide area network support for production software fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and offsite system hosting fees 

outside services 

outside services consist primarily of consulting services which include the supplementation of staff for activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance and legal regulatory and audit and tax advisory services 

royalty fees 

royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid for the use of underlying indexes in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded the company has licenses with the owners of the sp 500 index sp 100 index and certain other sp indexes the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell indexes this category also includes fees paid to market participants for order flow that they direct or cause to be directed to our exchanges and fees related to the dissemination of market data related to sp indexes 

trading volume incentives 

trading volume incentives consist of market linkage expenses incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges if a competing exchange quotes a better price we route the customers order to that exchange and pay certain of the associated costs regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our options exchanges the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers 

travel and promotional expenses 

travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising costs for special events sponsorship of industry conferences options education seminars and travel related expenses 

facilities costs 

facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent maintenance utilities real estate taxes and telecommunications costs 

other expenses 

other expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations but are not included in the above categories 

other incomeexpense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating and are classified as other incomeexpense these activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash and investments in other business ventures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 36 

revenue recognition 

 income taxes 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the company files tax returns for federal state and local income tax purposes a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 

if the company considers that a tax position is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position it recognizes the tax benefit the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position to the extent that the companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months interest and penalties if any are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the companys consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits

average revenue per contract discussed in more detail below is impacted by our fee structure which includes volume based incentive programs mix of products traded the account type customer firm marketmaker etc and the manner in which a trade is executed electronic openoutcry etc the implementation of fee changes which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges we cannot predict the trading patterns of market participants which may be based on factors outside our control but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market

factors contributing to the change in total average revenue per contract for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  included 

 

 40 

 access fees 

access fees for the year ended december 31 2014   decreased  to 593 million  from 610 million  in the comparable prior year period the decrease in access fees was primarily due to incentive programs for marketmaker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013 and a reduction in the number of trading permits 

the demand for trading permits could be impacted by market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2014   increased   21  to 380 million  from 373 million  in the comparable period in the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased demand for technology services terminal and other equipment rentals and certain services impacted by trading volume 

market data fees 

market data fees increased   222  to 304 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 249 million  in the prior year market data fees represent income derived from opra as well as the companys market data services which for the year ended december 31 2014  were 150 million  and 154 million  respectively and for the same period in 2013  were 129 million  and 120 million  respectively income derived from opra is allocated based on each exchanges share of total cleared options transactions the companys share of opra income for the period ended december 31 2014  increased to 249  from 217  for the same period in 2013  as a result of an increase in the companys share of total cleared options transactions revenue generated from the companys market data services which provide current and historical options and futures data increased 34 million  resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers and rates for certain market data services 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees increased   12  for the year ended 2014  to 371 million  from 367 million  in the same period in the prior year regulatory fees are primarily generated by the options regulatory fee that we charge on all trading permit holder customer volume industrywide which increased compared to the prior period the higher revenue attributed to volume was partially offset by cboe and c2 lowering their respective options regulatory fee rates as of august 1 2014 and a decrease in regulatory fees received for other regulatory services primarily related to cboe stock exchange llc cbsx which ceased trading operations on april 30 2014 

under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority finra to provide a majority of the regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets the company does not expect revenue generated from regulatory fees to be materially impacted by the agreement with finra 

concentration of revenue   

all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of the occ at december 31 2014  there were one hundred seven  trading permit holders that are clearing members of the occ two clearing members accounted for 46  of transaction and other fees collected through the occ in 2014  the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 11  of transaction and other fees collected through the occ no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing member firms represented more than 42  of transaction and other fees collected through the occ for the respective clearing member in 2014  should a clearing member withdraw from cboe we believe the trading permit holder portion of that clearing members trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing member 

the two largest clearing members mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe c2 and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to transfer to another clearing member this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including ours 

 41 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   172 million  or 60  to 3034 million  for the year ended 2014  from 2862 million  in the year ago period resulting from higher employee costs depreciation and amortization data processing and royalty fees partially offset by lower outside services expenses decreased  to 492  of total operating revenues in the year ended 2014  compared with 500  in the same period in 2013  

the following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013

for the year ended december 31 2014  employee costs were 1217 million  or 197  of total operating revenues compared with 1181 million  or 206  of total operating revenues in the same period in 2013  this represented an increase  of 36 million  or 31  resulting from higher salaries of 36 million  driven primarily by annual pay adjustments higher payroll taxes of 05 million  and higher health insurance costs of 04 million  higher severance expense of 24 million  primarily due to transition of a majority of regulatory services to finra and higher annual incentive compensation of 20 million  which is aligned with performance targets partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense of 52 million  

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets as part of the agreement a significant number of our regulatory staff as well as certain systems staff supporting our regulatory functions transitioned to finra resulting in a headcount reduction of over 100 employees as a result of the reduction in headcount we expect employees costs to be lower in 2015 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased  by 54 million  to 399 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with 345 million  for the same period in 2013  the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from increased capital spending to harden and enhance our trading platform and operations 

data processing 

data processing expenses increased   13 million  to 192 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with 179 million  in the prioryear period the increase in data processing expenses is primarily due to higher costs for hardware and software maintenance 

outside services 

expenses related to outside services decreased  to 320 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 345 million  in the prioryear period the 25 million  decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to litigation partially offset by higher costs for contract programmers the company received an insurance reimbursement for legal expenses of 15 million in 2013  

in december 2014 we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets as noted above certain staff transitioned from cboe to finra as a result of the transition costs for former employees in regulatory and systems staff supporting our regulatory functions will be included in outside services in 2015 as a result we expect outside services to be in higher in 2015 we do not expect this change to result in a material increase in total operating expenses in 2015 

 42 

royalty fees 

royalty fees for the year ended december 31 2014  were 661 million  compared with 566 million  for the prior year period an increase  of 95 million  the increase is primarily due to higher trading volume in licensed and proprietary products and an increase in royalty rates as a result of the amendment the company executed with sp opco llc “sp” effective as of march 2013 relating to the companys license to trade options and futures and create products based on certain sp indexes and higher fees associated with dissemination of certain market data

net income 

as a result of the items above net income allocated to common stockholders in 2014  was 1884 million  compared to 1739 million  in 2013  an increase  of 145 million  basic and diluted net income per share allocated to common stockholders were 221  and 199  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 51 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business this market risk consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents we have no longterm or shortterm debt the company does not trade options for its own account 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our cash and cash equivalents were 1479 million  and 2213 million  respectively we invest available cash in highly liquid shortterm investments such as money market funds and us treasury securities our investment policy is to preserve capital and liquidity a hypothetical three basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease annual earnings by less than 75000 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or decline since transactions on our exchanges are not governed by longterm contracts we believe that any increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on us

history 

cboe was founded in 1973 as a nonstock corporation owned by its members cboe was the first organized marketplace for the trading of standardized exchangetraded options on equity securities in 2004 cfe began operations as a futures exchange cboe holdings was incorporated in the state of delaware on august 15 2006 in june 2010 cboe demutualized see restructuring transaction and cboe c2 and cfe became whollyowned subsidiaries of cboe holdings in october 2010 c2 the companys allelectronic options exchange initiated operations 

restructuring transaction 

on june 18 2010 cboe converted from a nonstock corporation owned by its members into a stock corporation that is a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe holdings in the restructuring transaction each cboe regular membership an exchange seat owned by a cboe member on june 18 2010 converted into 80000 shares of class a common stock of cboe holdings seat owners received a total of 74400000 shares of class a common stock of cboe holdings in the restructuring 

 3 

transaction in addition certain persons who satisfied the qualification requirements set forth in the settlement agreement in the delaware action received a total of 16333380 shares of class b common stock of cboe holdings on june 18 2010 pursuant to the settlement agreement qualifying members of the plaintiff class received a cash payment of 3000 million 

the initial public offering of 13455000 shares of unrestricted common stock including 2085774 shares of unrestricted common stock sold by selling stockholders for a price of 2900 per share was completed on june 18 2010 net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriters fees and commissions and other related expenses were 3012 million costs directly associated with the companys initial public offering were recorded as a reduction of the gross proceeds received in arriving at the amount recorded in additional paidin capital 

upon consummation of the initial public offering the shares of class a and class b common stock not converted into unrestricted common stock and sold in the initial public offering automatically converted into 44323803 shares of class a1 common stock and 44323803 shares of class a2 common stock the company conducted tender offers in november 2010 and purchased 12017895 shares of class a1 and class a2 common stock on december 15 2010 and june 13 2011 respectively each remaining share of class a1 and class a2 common stock issued and outstanding converted into one share of unrestricted common stock as a result as of december 31 2011 no shares of class a1 or class a2 common stock were outstanding 

industry 

our primary business of offering exchangetraded options and futures contracts is part of the large and growing global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset or reference value these underlying assets and reference values include individual stocks stock indexes exchangetraded funds exchangetraded notes debt instruments interest rates currencies commodities various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies economic indicators and artificial assets such as pollution rights the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

exchangetraded options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset most options traded on us securities exchanges and overthecounter are on individual equities market indexes and etps 

futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that require delivery of a commodity bond currency stock index or other benchmark interests at a specified price and on a specified future date which are settled in cash on cfe futures exchanges may also list for trading options on futures 

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 4100 underlying stocks indexes and etps among other products the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including marketmakers is a key feature of the options market marketmakers collectively provide continuous bids and offers for all listed options series over the past decade trading in the options market has migrated from being primarily conducted facetoface or open outcry to being primarily electronic as a result many liquidity providers now operate remotely away from the physical trading floors and the majority of options trading volume is handled and executed electronically 

trends 

increased number of competitors 

over the past ten years the number of options exchanges has more than doubled from five exchanges to twelve the ability to offer multiple differentiated market and pricing models coupled with the relative ease of introducing new exchanges on existing technology have led to multiple exchange operators including cboe operating more than one exchange as the business continues to expand and offer greater margins than the equity trading business it is possible that our competitors or new entrants into the exchange business could open additional new options exchanges 

price competition 

as the number of exchange participants expands exchanges have become much more aggressive at utilizing fees to attract business this includes both transaction fees assessed to access liquidity and incentive programs to attract order flow order flow particularly customer order flow is the primary driver of options exchange operating results in the past several 

 4 

years the competition for this business has become increasingly fierce with both exchanges and marketmakers competing to attract this order flow this is due in part to the concentration of the routing of customer order flow with a limited number of firms known as consolidators who make routing decisions based on pricing and the ability to internalize order flow some exchanges have structured their options businesses in partnership with established market participants and order flow providers others offer specific payments for order flow in addition to any economic incentives received from marketmakers and other participants 

technology 

exchanges have invested heavily in developing technology to provide functionality and performance in order to compete in the industry market participants continually demand improved performance and reduced latency they expect exchanges to provide them with opportunities for price improvement and additional functionality including risk mitigation processing of complex orders and maximum execution quality 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a global leader and innovator in the options industry we believe we are well positioned to further enhance our leadership position through several key competitive strengths 

 growth strategy 

we believe that the derivatives industry especially the listed options and futures industry has significant growth potential including through new participants and products we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

  5 

our proprietary products are those in which we have a property right or for which we have an exclusive license listed options on equities and etps currently may be listed on all options exchanges while trading in our proprietary products is limited to our exchanges thus our proprietary products are able to support a higher revenue per contract than multiplylisted products 

 we also held our second european risk management conference in 2013 building on the success of both our domestic risk management conference and the first european risk management conference which we held in 2012 we plan to continue pursuing international opportunities to increase trading in our products including extending hours for trading in certain of our index options products further expanding the hours for vix futures trading and increasing our business development activities in asia 

 in addition through a set of arrangements with sp we permit sp to license the companys proprietary indexes and index methodologies for certain purposes to securities firms and other exchanges the company and sp have agreed that sp may license one or more clearing agencies to clear overthecounter or otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction the options clearing corporation occ plans to begin offering clearing services for these products in the second quarter of 2014 

 products 

our exchanges provide a marketplace for the trading of options and futures contracts that meet criteria established in the rules of the respective exchange the options contracts listed for trading include options on indexes equities and etps in addition we provide marketplaces for trading futures contracts through cfe 

  6 

 weeklys 

weeklys options are options that provide expiration opportunities every week weeklys options can provide opportunities for investors to implement more targeted buying selling or spreading strategies cboe and c2 offer weeklys options on a number of products including spx since 2010 weeklys options as a percentage of industry options volume have grown from 2 to 21 

leaps 

in addition to the standard term options offered cboe and c2 also offer longterm equity anticipation securities or leaps on a number of equities etps and market indexes leaps are longterm options contracts that allow investors to establish positions that can be maintained for a period of up to fifteen years 

proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility indexes based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and a series of options strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes we have also licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense some of these indexes the company generates revenue from the calculation and dissemination of over thirty realtime index values for third party licensors and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

strategic relationships 

the company has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for indexes index options and other products in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list certain products based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

  7 

options exchanges market participants 

as discussed in more detail below our options exchanges are designed to provide reliable orderly liquid and efficient marketplaces for the trading of options by market participants our options exchanges operate quotedriven auction markets that involve a number of different market participants 

trading permit holders 

purchasing a monthly marketmaker trading permit cboe c2 electronic access permit cboe c2 or floor broker trading permit cboe for the respective exchange conveys trading permit holder status on that exchange to the permit holder 

a trading permit holder on one of our options exchanges is allowed to enter orders and quotes into the trading system for that exchange trading permit holder entities can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other permit holders or for the accounts of customers 

applicants for trading permit holder status 

applicants for trading permit holder status must have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of trading permit holder status all trading permit holders must agree to abide by the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange additionally they must comply with the provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the sec 

our regulatory services division is the investigative arm of our exchanges with regard to compliance with exchange rules trading permit holders who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

options trading permits 

 

 participant roles 

direct access to our options marketplaces is granted through trading permits a trading permit entitles the holder to conduct business on the exchange including in one of the participant roles described below 

  8 

 several of the functions described above namely marketmaker dpm edpm and lmm are often grouped together as liquidity providers this name refers to the fact that they all provide liquidity to the options market through their various obligations to provide to the marketplace twosided quotes at which they are obligated to trade any of these liquidity providers may be designated as a preferred marketmaker by a member firm routing an order to cboe the preferred marketmaker is afforded a participation right on specific orders provided that he or she meets certain other requirements with respect to the relevant options class and quoting obligations 

cfe market participants 

parties are required to apply and be approved as cfe trading privilege holders and obtain a cfe trading permit in order to have trading privileges on cfe trading privilege holders on cfe are allowed to enter orders into cfes trading system and can execute trades for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers 

under its rules cfe has the authority to establish marketmaker programs and appoint one or more dpms lmms or marketmakers however cfe does not have a dpm lmm or marketmaker program in vix futures 

market model 

algorithms 

at the core of the market model on all of our exchanges are matching algorithms which are the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants our technology and the rules of our exchanges provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers our options trading systems monitor the national best bid and offer nbbo and orders are not executed at a price inferior to the displayed nbbo except pursuant to limited exceptions provided in cboe or c2s rules we have the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products in order to meet the needs of particular market segments the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

  orders can be routed to other marketplaces via contracted brokers for execution if a better displayed price exists elsewhere see regulatory responsibilities  options intermarket linkage plan details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

 9 

pricing 

each of our exchanges establishes a fee schedule that among other things sets the transaction fee for buying or selling options or futures contracts on the exchange and access fees for accessing our exchanges cboe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees are charged to most professionals including marketmakers but are not charged for most customer orders cboe also has a volume incentive program or vip which pays credits to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of qualifying customer business at the exchange 

c2 uses a makertaker pricing model for etp options in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace receive a rebate in february 2013 c2 modified its pricing model for equity options to provide that marketmaker professional brokerdealer and firm transactions are charged fees based on the width of the market 

cfe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s trading system or is a block trade or exchange of contract for a related position transaction cfe also offers a day trade fee program that provides rebates on trades that qualify for the program 

each of the exchanges also currently charges a fee for trading permits that allow access to our exchanges beginning in 2013 cboe implemented a sliding scale for all marketmaker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used for appointments in any options classes other than spx 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 264  to 314  annually for 2013  our market share was 279  

the us options industry is extremely competitive and the competition has intensified we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaption and our reputation there are ten other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors including ise nasdaq omx nom nasdaq omx phlx nyse amex and nyse arca we also compete against futures exchanges trading similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank legislation creates a type of marketplace called a swap execution facility sef sefs serve as marketplaces for the matching of swap transactions we also compete against futures exchanges and sefs to attract otc participants 

most options on equities and etps listed and traded on cboe and c2 are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges the options exchanges have been introducing new pricing models over the last few years in order to attempt to attract additional trades to their exchanges these pricing models include traditional pricing makertaker and ownership benefits see trends  price competition 

our competitive challenge is to persuade brokerdealers to route options orders to our exchanges rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their market making activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on equities and etps we compete through a variety of methods including

 technology 

cboe command 

cboe command our inhouse developed technology supports trading on multiple exchanges cboe c2 cfe cbsx and onechicago llc the technology supports different products different market models and multiple matching algorithms as mentioned above cboe is a hybrid exchange while c2 cfe cbsx and onechicago are fully electronic we have licensed our technology for use by cbsx an allelectronic stock trading facility of cboe and onechicago an allelectronic exchange for trading singlestock futures in the hybrid format which is used on cboe cboe command provides features of screenbased and floorbased trading 

cboe command is a java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and low latency and is easily scalable for capacity and throughput peak message traffic rates are 18 million transactions per second the architecture and implementation of the system allows for flexibility in allocation algorithms a fully integrated complex order book and several auction mechanisms 

the platform supports a quotedriven options market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations marketmakers dpms edpms and lmms typically stream hundreds of millions of quotes into cboe command each day to facilitate liquidity providers cboe command has a number of internal risk controls including quote lock and quote risk monitor 

cboe command allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products in addition our system facilitates different trading models through the use of alternative configurations allowing us to provide both hybrid and fully electronic market models cboe also offers cflex our hybrid platform for trading flexible exchange options or flex options built on the cboe command platform 

in 2012 cboe moved its primary data center from the cboe building in chicago to a data center location in new jersey to eliminate distance latency the move also introduced enhanced versions of firm interface protocols and a complete operating system upgrade of cboe command from solaris to redhat linux 

hybrid trading model 

all cboe products trade with an electronic and openoutcry component where both are integrated to function as a single market our hybrid trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe command trading platform for our amsettled spx options and pmsettled spx quarterlys certain of the electronic trading features are differently configured to better suit the needs of customers in those products and resulting in a higher rate of openoutcry trading 

cboe marketmakers stream their own individual quotes in products other than spx and spxq where only lmms stream quotes into the cboe trading engine and if on the floor engage in open outcry transactions in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer the best of both electronic and open outcry trading models 

trade match ticker plant and market data 

the trade match system is built on the same technology as cboe command it matches trades and sends them to occ which settles and clears the trades the trade match system provides matched trade information and posttrade allocation functionality to clearing firms and brokers through a webbased interface and an application programming interface or api 

both incoming and outgoing market data is vital to the operations of our exchanges and to market participants our ticker plant xtp takes in market data feeds from opra ctscqs nasdaq cme group and other sources and disseminates the data internally to other systems on a publishsubscribe basis xtps most recent processing peak was 75 million messages per second or mps inbound from opra with over 146 billion messages per day xtp and our index calculation systems allow cboe to calculate numerous different types of indexes and add new ones as required 

market data is sent to opra ctscqs nasdaq data vendors and to trading permit holders via our apis including fix and cmi cboe financial network and cboe streaming markets csm described below 

our exchanges generate valuable information regarding the prices of our products and the trading activity in our exchanges for options market data relating to price and size of market quotations and the price and size of trades is collected and consolidated by opra opra disseminates the information for a fee to vendors who redistribute the data to brokers 

 11 

investors and other persons or entities that use our markets or that monitor general economic conditions after costs are deducted the fees collected are distributed among opras exchange participants based on their cleared transactions pursuant to the opra plan as of december 2013  our market data was displayed on approximately 149000 terminals worldwide see regulatory environment and compliance for further information on opra 

our subsidiary market data express llc mdx sells historical options data and realtime data index values it also provides market data through  a proprietary streaming data feed in 2014 we plan to enhance csms offerings to include market depth 

disaster recovery 

we operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities that essentially replicate the systems available in our primary data center for cboe and cfe we expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period and are working with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened we continue to work to improve both the availability of our systems and our disaster recovery facilities including through simulation testing 

clearing system 

the occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us options exchanges upon execution of an options trade we transmit to the occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes the occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on cfe 

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion covers the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of certain recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

consolidated audit trail cat 

in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory organizations or sros through a new regulation to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail cat which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market the regulation requires among other things that upon implementation of a plan data be reported to a central repository the following day by each exchange and broker dealer we are working with the other sros to develop the plan to implement a consolidated audit trail which is required to detail technological and compliance aspects of the plan and the costs to implement the plan among other details the sros are required to submit the plan by september 30 2014 with a phased implementation over the three years following the effectiveness of the plan the exchanges and their participants are likely to incur significant costs related to the implementation of the consolidated audit trail requirements 

regulation system compliance and integrity reg sci and working group initiatives 

on march 8 2013 the sec proposed a new regulation regulation systems compliance and integrity “reg sci” under the securities exchange act as proposed reg sci would require “sci entities” which includes selfregulatory organizations like cboe and c2 to comply with security and capacity requirements with respect to their systems and accompanying compliance procedures the proposed regulation would replace and codify the current automation review policy under the proposed reg sci cboe and c2 would be required to establish written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that their systems have adequate integrity to ensure a resilient market in the event of a disruption this includes for example each exchange ensuring that it has adequate disaster recovery facilities that are geographically diverse from the exchange’s systems it also requires timely and substantial notification to be made to the sec in the event an exchange experiences any system interruption or interference the sec has also established various working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency including regarding regulatory halts trade nullification and additional market protections as proposed reg sci and the other sec mandated working group initiatives are very complex and as such compliance with the final rules may require significant resources 

 12 

cftc core principles 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act in 2012 the cftc adopted a number of new regulations applicable to designated contract markets dcms in order to implement the amended core principles these regulations related to among other things compliance with rules prevention of market disruption financial integrity of transactions disciplinary procedures system safeguards and financial resources as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to these new requirements 

one aspect with respect to the amended core principles applicable to dcms that remains pending relates to amended core principle 9 core principle 9 requires each dcm to provide a competitive open and efficient market and mechanism for executing transactions that protects the price discovery process of trading in the dcm’s centralized market cftc regulations to implement core principle 9 remain pending and may address the extent to which a dcm may permit block trades and exchanges of derivatives for related positions in its products to occur through the dcm outside of the dcm’s centralized market cfe cannot predict or estimate the extent to which these regulations may affect cfe or its operations

in 2013 the cftc issued a concept release that sought public comment regarding a series of existing and potential pretrade risk controls post trade reports and other posttrade measures system safeguards related to the design testing and supervision of automated trading systems and additional protections designed to promote safe and orderly markets the concept release was intended to serve as a platform for cataloguing existing industry practices determining their efficacy and implementation to date and evaluating the need for additional measures if any the concept release did not include any proposed new regulations but could lead to the proposal by the cftc of additional regulations in this regard that could impact cfe or its operations 

agency rulemaking areas 

in addition to the above identified areas the sec has been directed under doddfrank to implement many new rules both alone and in conjunction with the cftc these areas include portfolio margining and swap clearing and execution 

thee sec has proposed rules including options fee caps and banning flash orders that it has not acted upon while we do not expect the sec to take action with respect to options fee caps or banning flash orders as these proposals are dated if one or both of the proposals were adopted they could cause significant changes to our market that may reduce our revenue per contract or reduce the volume of trading on our exchanges 

compliance 

securities industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organization sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec cbsx which is not an sro is a stock trading facility of cboe as a facility cboe is responsible for the regulation of the cbsx marketplace and the following discussion of cboes responsibilities includes the responsibility to provide regulation for cbsx and cboes other facilities in addition national stock exchange inc nsx is a stock exchange that is a selfregulatory organization wholly owned by cbsx cboe is committed to support nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities 

sros in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec prior to beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the sro has the ability to comply with the exchange act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members known as tphs at cboe and c2 through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and 

 13 

may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the securities exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of cboes or c2s rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that the cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time 

consent order 

on june 11 2013 cboe and c2 entered into a consent order with the sec the consent order under which cboe and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the securities exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings these undertakings include conducting a review of our regulatory programs enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implementing training programs for employees the consent order also requires ongoing certifications by the companys chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer for five years following the completion of certain of the undertakings as of the date of this filing cboe and c2 have certified to their compliance with each of the undertakings that were required to be certified to within the time frames indicated in the consent order 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are also subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure fair representation of trading permit holders in the selection of cboe and c2 directors public participation in the governance of cboe and c2 and that cboe and c2 can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of cboe and c2 and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of cboe c2 or national stock exchange inc nsx relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out their responsibilities under the exchange act to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to the exchanges the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a 

 14 

contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market that is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act as a designated contract market cfe is required to comply with the core principles under the commodity exchange act that are applicable to designated contract markets and with related cftc regulations cfe has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules if cfe fails to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations cfe may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of its business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of cfe’s designation as a contract market

 as further described below each options exchange is also responsible for reviewing its trading permit holders activities related to the conduct of business directly with public customers or sales practice 

in order to ensure market integrity we regulate and monitor our trading permit holders trading activities providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of marketmakers brokerdealers and institutional and retail investors 

we expend considerable time financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities exchange industry and within the regulatory regime overseen by the sec our primary regulator in order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our options exchange rules we have developed our own automated market surveillance systems to monitor market activity on our options exchanges and across us options market 

as part of the selfregulatory process disciplinary matters other than minor matters covered by our minor rule violation plan are reviewed by our business conduct committee which includes both market participants and public representatives cboe c2 and cfe are participants in the intermarket surveillance group isg isg is an international informationsharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement in addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing the isg provides a framework for the coordination of regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities commodity futures and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses 

we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes

rule 17d2 agreements 

section 17d of the exchange act and the related exchange act rules permit sros to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation under exchange act rule 17d1 the sec designates one sro to be the designated examining authority dea for each brokerdealer that is a member of more than one sro the dea is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the financial responsibility aspects of that brokerdealer we are the dea for many of our members 

exchange act rule 17d2 permits sros to enter into agreements commonly called rule 17d2 agreements which are approved by the sec and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those sros and relating to members those sros have in common we have entered into rule 17d2 agreements under which the financial industry regulatory authority finra is allocated responsibility for enforcing rules related to options sales practices with respect to cboe and c2 trading permit holders and insider trading rules and certain other rules with respect to cbsx trading permit holders we have entered into other rule 17d2 agreements that allocate responsibility to each sro for ensuring that their allocated common members comply with rules governing expiring exercise declarations options position limits and large options position reporting and position adjustments finally we have entered into a rule 17d2 agreement that allocates certain responsibilities under regulation nms to a market participants dea

 item 1a risk factors 

certain statements contained in this report under various sections including business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see forwardlooking statements these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our right to exclusively list certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and the djia granted to us by the owners of such indexes in 2013  approximately 416  of our transaction fees were generated by our semiexclusive and exclusivelylicensed index products the bulk of which are attributable to our sp 500 index options products which are our largest products by revenue as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products 

there is a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

we also list for trading volatility products based on our proprietary vix methodology combined our volatilitybased options and futures accounted for 364  of our transaction fees in 2013 if we are unable to retain our proprietary rights in the vix methodology our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing or loss of the ability to offer these products for trading which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition the european union parliament council of the eu and eu commission have reached an agreement in principle on legislation that would require european exchanges to provide nondiscriminatory access to benchmarks like index options while similar legislation has not been proposed in the united states if it were passed it could cause us to lose our property rights in our internally developed and licensed index products 

 18 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes we may be subject to legal or other action taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively license indexes 

we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and we and our competitors have adjusted our transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by opening new exchanges which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us especially on transaction fees for our multiplylisted products as a result of these pricing pressures our average rate per multiplylisted contract has decreased from 0179  in 2011 to 0109  in 2013 it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them as a result of these competitive developments our market share of total options traded in the us fell from approximately 314  in 2009 to approximately 279  in 2013  

like nearly all of the other options exchanges our options exchanges charge an options regulatory fee or orf to trading permit holders based on the total number of customer contracts cleared by that trading permit holder regardless of the exchange on which the trade is executed along with fines and other regulatory fees the orf revenues may only be used to support our regulatory functions we may face competitive pressures to reduce or not increase the orfs on our exchanges and if we are unable to maintain or if necessary increase the orfs our results of operation may be adversely affected 

if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected for example we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations or sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec in addition cbsx is a stock trading facility of cboe and cboe regulates cbsx in december 2011 cbsx acquired nsx a registered national securities exchange that offers a market for trading stocks while nsx is not a facility of cboe in the acquisition cboe committed to support nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities cfe is a designated contract market registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the firms that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which other sros with respect to our options exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain significant obligations to regulate our trading permit holders especially on our options markets see business  regulatory responsibilities 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the sec and cftc have 

 19 

broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and designated contract markets respectively pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement and compliance to be deficient cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of an exchanges registration as a national securities exchange any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe or c2 may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with the cboe and c2 see regulatory environment and compliance—regulatory responsibilities 

in addition we are performing certain regulatory services for orsa and other exchanges with which we are not otherwise affiliated under regulatory services agreements while the exchanges for which we provide regulatory services remain ultimately responsible for their respective regulatory responsibilities if we are unable to perform under these agreements we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by the sec and may be liable to the entities for which we provide services and their end users 

if we are unable to execute the undertakings in the consent order it may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

on june 11 2013 cboe and c2 entered into the consent order with the sec under which cboe and c2 were censured ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the securities exchange act paid a fine of 6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings these undertakings include conducting a review of our regulatory programs enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implementing training programs for employees the consent order also requires ongoing certifications by cboe and c2s chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer for five years 

we may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the sec if the sec were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the consent order any investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition with respect to certain of the undertakings required by the consent order if the sec staff thinks that a review completed is inadequate it may require us to engage an independent consultant to conduct an additional review which would cause us to incur additional expense 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2013  2012  and 2011  approximately 694  697  and 734  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis  operating revenues  average revenue per contract if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

 20 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities including occ could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while many of its requirements are in the process of being implemented some of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them 

in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory agencies to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us market in addition to increased regulatory obligations implementation of a consolidated audit trail could result in significant additional expenditures including to implement any new technology to meet any plans requirements the sec has also proposed regulation systems compliance and integrity reg sci and has established working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency the adoption of reg sci or other regulations or mandates generated by these working groups could result in significant additional expenses including for technology and compliance 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses including in response to recent incidents that have disrupted operations on exchanges although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

in addition congress the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the options or futures industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the ten other us options exchanges we also compete against investment banks and other entities that trade options overthecounter see also our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

  21 

 the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index and futures products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to pay damages stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for further discussion of patent litigation involving us please see legal proceedings 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and network services including the systems that comprise cboe command the platform for trading on our exchanges if we are unable to operate monitor or maintain these systems or program them so that they operate correctly and maintain the integrity of their data it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a complete backup of cboe and cfe the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach despite the enhancements made to our disaster recovery facilities there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace if we can open at all 

in addition during 2013 we extended the trading hours on cfe for vix futures and expect to extend the trading hours further in 2014 for certain products on both cfe and cboe with extended trading hours we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer nontrading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely 

 22 

our systems may fail in whole or in part or may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems including the systems that calculate and transmit our index values our communications networks which include personally identifiable information and the systems of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control if our security measures are compromised or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems including harm to reputation and litigation caused by any breaches in security or system failures measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

  23 

 general economic conditions affect options trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy may have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume because our structure and overhead costs are based on assumptions of certain levels of market activity significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees account for a significant portion of our operating revenues  107  in 2013  cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities there may be a conflict of interest between our regulatory responsibilities and the interests of some of our market participants or our own business interests any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws and sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our policies and procedures designed to meet those compliance responsibilities as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed or that our compliance and internal audit functions would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness if these policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business in may 2013 mr brodsky stepped down as our chief executive officer and became executive chairman with mr tilly becoming chief executive officer and mr provost becoming president and chief operating officer the failure to retain members of our management team and successfully implement our management transition could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our regulatory and technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems and regulatory personnel could result in systems errors or regulatory infractions consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

over the past five years we have demutualized launched a second options exchange experienced significantly increased volume on our futures exchange extended trading hours on our futures exchange and significantly increased the staff in our regulatory division we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our 

 24 

management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and we will need to continue to expand train and manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including banking and clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms the host of our data center securities information processors such as the consolidated tape association and opra and various vendors of communications and networking products and services we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services or make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business in addition our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe our futures exchange the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business decisions 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may not approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and various groups have specifically targeted the financial services industry due to its perceived role in the current economic and political climate at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any cases of data theft corruption of data or compromised customer data security breaches may have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

misconduct by our customers or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our trading permit holders other persons who use our markets or our employees will engage in fraud or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of sros and a designated contract market it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the 

 25 

precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

changes in the tax structure affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

throughout 2013 congress discussed modifications to the taxation of financial products including repealing the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income requiring all derivatives to be markedtomarket and eliminating the exemption for qualified covered calls in addition federal and state legislation may be introduced that would impose a new tax on certain financial transactions including exchangetraded options transaction tax legislation has been proposed in illinois and the european union has proposed adopting a transaction tax which if adopted may lead to calls for a similar tax in the united states 

if the proposed tax law changes a transaction tax or other tax change that detrimentally impacts options or futures trading were to become law the resulting tax law could have a negative impact on the options industry and us by making options transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading in options in addition other states are attempting to increase tax revenues by asserting that they have nexus over certain companies if another state were to successfully assert nexus against us we may experience a higher marginal state tax rate 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect the market price of our unrestricted common stock 

we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for us that a stockholder might consider favorable these include provisions 

 26 

 in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

in addition delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2013  the end of the period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 

the company reviews its legal proceedings and claims regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions the company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading the company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote the companys assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals 

 27 

estimates of probable losses resulting from patent litigation involving the company are inherently difficult to make particularly when the companys view of the case is significantly different than that expressed by the plaintiff the company has not recorded a liability related to damages in connection with these matters 

as of december 31 2013  the company does not think that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these reviews inspections or other legal proceedings if any has been incurred while the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on our earnings in any given reporting period

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements see risk factors and forwardlooking statements above 

overview 

cboe holdings inc is the holding company for chicago board options exchange incorporated c2 options exchange incorporated cboe futures exchange llc and other subsidiaries 

the primary business of the company is the operation of markets for the trading of listed or exchangetraded derivatives contracts on four broad product categories 1 options on various market indexes index options 2 futures on the vix index and other products 3 options on the stocks of individual corporations equity options and 4 options on other exchangetraded products etp options such as exchangetraded funds etf options and exchangetraded notes etn options 

the company owns and operates three standalone exchanges but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment cboe is our primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single exchange is known as our hybrid trading model c2 is our allelectronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options but with a different market model and fee structure than cboe cfe our allelectronic futures exchange offers futures on the vix index as well as on other products 

components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fees transaction fees are a function of three variables 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume and 3 transaction mix between contract type because transaction fees are assessed on a per contract basis transaction fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are primarily influenced by factors outside its control including price competition price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis transaction fees accounted for 694  697  and 734  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the main options categories traded are equities indexes and etps the equity options category reflects trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies the index options category reflects trading in index options contracts on market indexes the etp options category includes etf options that are options on baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index but which trade like individual stocks and etn options that are options on senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities issued by an underwriting bank futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that require delivery of a commodity bond currency stock index or other benchmark interests at a specified price and on a specified future date which are settled in cash on cfe 

the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the increasing use of options represents a longterm trend that will continue in the future furthermore we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the overthecounter market to exchanges 

while there is no certainty we expect that the industrywide and companyspecific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes however additional factors may arise that could also impact contract trading volume which may result in increases or decrease in our contract trading volume such as new or existing competition or other events considering these factors we do not expect recent trading volumes to be an indicator of future trading volume 

 33 

access fees 

access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit holders for the opportunity to trade and use other related functions of cboe c2 and cfe the cboe program contains a tierbased marketmaker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and in the case of marketmakers the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products beginning in mid2013 cboe implemented sliding scales for all marketmaker and floor broker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used for appointments in any options classes other than spx spxpm vix oex and xeo the number of trading permits made available are limited 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services trading floor space and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and through our subsidiary market data express llc mdx through mdx we sell historical options data as well as realtime data for certain proprietary products and indexes it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets a highavailability low latency streaming data feed opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges including cboe and c2 authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter opra is not consolidated with the company 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as selfregulatory organizations under the exchange act cboe and c2 charge the options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industrywide customer volume of trading permit holders this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holders declines and rates are not increased or are decreased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease 

the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions some of which are included in this revenue category and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses mainly in employee costs and outside services 

other revenue 

the following subcategories are the sources of revenue within this category

 significant events in 2013   

total industry cleared options contracts in 2013  totaled 41 billion contracts a 3 increase from the 2012 volume of 40 billion contracts as reported by the occ in addition 2013 marks the second highest year for options industry cleared contract volume to date and the third consecutive year in which volume surpassed 4 billion contracts 

in 2013  we continued to experience growth in the trading of our proprietary products primarily spx options vix options and vix futures for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year period we experienced increases in total volume in spx options vix options and vix futures of 189  291  and 679  respectively we believe the volume increases are primarily due to a broader customer base resulting in part from educational and marketing initiatives aimed at attracting new users 

on march 9 2013 cboe entered into amendment no 12 the “ sp amendment” to the license agreement as amended the “sp agreement” by and between cboe and sp opco llc “sp” as successorininterest to standard  poors financial services llc pursuant to which cboe and c2 may list for trading securities options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and certain other sp indexes the sp amendment extended the term of the sp agreement until december 31 2033 and provides exclusivity to the company until december 31 2032 with respect to the sp 500 index

our share of total exchangetraded options contracts for the year ended december 31 2013  was 279  compared to 278  from the prior year period trading volume is impacted by many factors including macroeconomic events market volatility regulatory actions or considerations availability of capital competition pricing number of trading days in the period and seasonality

professionals marketmakers clearing trading permit holders and brokerdealers the implementation of fee changes which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges we cannot predict the trading patterns of exchange participants which may be based on factors outside our control but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market

factors contributing to the increase in total average revenue per contract for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  included 

 

 

at december 31 2013  there were one hundred four cboe clearing firms two of which cleared a combined 48  of our billings collected through the occ in 2013  the next largest clearing firm accounted for approximately 6  of our billings collected through the occ no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing firms represented more than 39  of the revenue collected through the occ in 2013  should a clearing firm withdraw from cboe we believe the trading permit holder portion of that firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm 

the two largest clearing firms mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe c2 and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these firms were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to transfer to another firm this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including ours 

access fees 

access fees for the year ended december 31 2013   decreased  to 610 million  from 641 million  in the comparable prior year period the decrease in access fees was primarily due to the implementation of an incentive programs for marketmaker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013 which lowered monthly access fees 

the demand for trading permits could be impacted by market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2013   increased   188  to 373 million  from 314 million  in the comparable period in the prior year resulting from the introduction of a network access option offered in connection with the companys data center move to new jersey in december 2012

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees increased   745  for the year ended 2013  to 367 million  from 210 million  in the same period in the prior year resulting from cboe and c2 increasing their options regulatory fee rates and higher trading permit holder customer volume industrywide as compared to the same period in 2012  effective september 1 2013 cboe decreased its options regulatory fee rate and c2 suspended its options regulatory fee rate 

the companys regulatory fees are primarily based on the number of customer contracts traded by trading permit holders throughout the listed united states options industry under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   180 million  or 67  to 2862 million  for the year ended 2013  from 2682 million  in the year ago period resulting from higher employee costs depreciation and amortization and royalty fees partially offset by lower data processing outside services trading volume incentives and other expense expenses decreased  to 500  of total operating revenues in the year ended 2013  compared with 523  in the same period in 2012

the increase in stockbased compensation of 85 million  resulted from the amortization of stockcompensation expense relating to the february 2013 and may 2013 grants and the recognition of 40 million  of accelerated stockbased compensation related to the february 2013 grant to certain executives due to provisions contained in their employment arrangements and the recognition of the remaining value of stock grants awarded in june 2010 to employees in the companys regulatory division who are no longer eligible to receive equity based compensation

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or decline since transactions on our exchanges are not governed by longterm contracts we believe that any increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on us

industry 

our primary business of offering exchangetraded options and futures is part of the large and growing global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from some other underlying asset or reference value these underlying assets and reference values include individual stocks stock indexes debt instruments interest rates currencies commodities various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies economic indicators and artificial assets such as pollution rights the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

exchangetraded options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset options on us securities are traded privately between two parties known as overthecounter or otc options as well as traded on us securities exchanges the vast majority of derivatives traded on us securities exchanges are options on individual equities market indexes and etps overthecounter options that are traded also include options on individual equities etps and indexes including spx 

futures represent a contract in which the buyer and seller agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment 

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3200 underlying stocks indexes and etps the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including marketmakers is a key feature of the options markets marketmakers are required to provide continuous bids and offers for substantially all listed option series in return for these commitments marketmakers receive margin relief as well as other incentives such as participation rights and fee incentives 

over the past decade trading in the options market has migrated from being almost exclusively conducted facetoface or open outcry to being primarily electronic as a result many liquidity providers now operate remotely away from the physical trading floors and the majority of options trading volume is handled and executed electronically 

trends 

fragmentation 

over the past ten years the number of options exchanges has more than doubled from five exchanges to eleven consolidation of any scale at the holding company level last impacted the listed options markets in 2008 when the parent corporations for amex and nyse arca merged the ability to offer multiple differentiated market and pricing models coupled with the scalability of introducing new exchanges on existing technology have led to multiple exchange operators including cboe operating more than one exchange as the business continues to expand and offer greater margins than the equity trading business it is possible that our competitors or new entrants into the exchange business could open new options exchanges 

cost competition 

as the number of exchange participants expands exchanges have become much more aggressive at utilizing fees to attract business this includes both transaction fees assessed to access liquidity and incentive programs to attract order flow order flow particularly retail order flow is the primary driver of option exchange operating results in the past several years the competition for this business has become increasingly fierce with both exchanges and marketmakers competing to attract this order flow some exchanges have structured their options businesses in partnership with established market participants and order flow providers others offer specific payments for order flow in addition to any economic incentives received from marketmakers and other participants 

technology 

exchanges also differentiate themselves based on the technology both in terms of functionality and performance which they employ to attract market participants market participants continually demand improved performance and reduced latency they expect exchanges to provide them with additional functionality including risk mitigation for marketmakers and processing of complex orders 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a global leader and innovator in the options industry we believe we are well positioned to further enhance our leadership position through several key competitive strengths 

 5 

 growth strategy 

despite a decline in current year trading over the past several years trading in derivative products has expanded as a result of a number of factors including technological advances that have increased investor access declining costs to users globalization and greater understanding of the products by increasingly sophisticated market participants the company is well positioned to leverage its competitive strengths to take advantage of these trends 

we intend to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

 6 

continuing product innovations will generate increased use of our other products in the same way that vix products and the cboe sp 500 buywrite index have generated additional trading activity in spx 

 products 

our options exchanges provide a marketplace for the trading of options contracts that meet criteria established in rules of the respective exchange the options contracts listed for trading include options on individual equities options on various market indexes as well as options on etps in addition we provide marketplaces for trading futures contracts and cash equities through cfe and cboe stock exchange llc cbsx respectively cbsx is not a consolidated subsidiary of the company 

 proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility indexes based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and a series of option strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes we also have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense some of these indexes the company generates revenue from the calculation and dissemination of over thirty realtime index values for third party licensors and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

in 2012 we introduced sp 500 range options on cboe and the cboe nasdaq100 volatility index futures and sp 500 variance futures all traded on cfe security futures and options on the cboe emerging markets etf volatility index the cboe brazil etf volatility index and the cboe crude oil etf volatility index were also launched on cfe and cboe respectively 

strategic relationships 

the company also has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for index options in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list options contracts based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

 8 

russell indexes as the basis for standardized exchangetraded options contracts this license is nonexclusive and is effective through the end of 2014 

market model

our regulatory services division is the investigative arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules trading permit holders who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

market participants 

direct access to our options marketplaces is granted through trading permits a trading permit entitles the holder to conduct business on the exchange including in one of the participant roles described below 

 9 

an offfloor dpm is providing electronic markets only other than in spx the lmms receive participation rights in electronic or open outcry in spx lmms do not receive participation rights and four lmms are appointed to quote simultaneously each expiration cycle 

 several of the functions described above namely marketmaker dpm edpm and lmm are often grouped together as liquidity providers this name refers to the fact that they all provide liquidity to the options market through their various obligations to provide to the marketplace twosided quotes at which they are obligated to trade any of these liquidity providers may be designated as a preferred marketmaker by a member firm routing an order to cboe the preferred marketmaker is afforded a participation right on specific orders provided that he or she meets certain other requirements with respect to the relevant option class and quoting obligations 

under its rules cfe has the authority to establish marketmaker programs in its products and appoint one or more dpms lmms or marketmakers however cfe does not have a dpm lmm or marketmaker program in vix futures 

hybrid trading model 

most option classes on cboe are traded using its hybrid trading model in which aspects of both open outcry and electronic trading are integrated to function as a single exchange both c2 and cfe are allelectronic exchanges our hybrid trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe command trading platform which in alternative configurations also serves as the trading platform for c2 and cfe 

cboe marketmakers stream their own individual quotes and orders into the cboe trading engine and if on the floor in open outcry transactions effected in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer the best of both electronic and open outcry trading models 

algorithms 

at the core of our market model are the matching algorithms which is the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants our technology and the rules of our exchanges provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers we have the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products in order to meet the needs of particular market segments the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

 10 

 our options trading systems monitors the national best bid and offer nbbo and orders are not executed at a price inferior to the displayed nbbo except pursuant to limited exceptions provided in cboe or c2s rules orders can be routed to other marketplaces via contracted brokers for execution if a better displayed price exists elsewhere see regulatory responsibilities  options intermarket linkage plan details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

pricing 

each of our exchanges establishes a fee schedule that among other things establishes the transaction fee for buying or selling options or futures contracts on the exchange cboe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees are charged to most professionals including marketmakers but are not charged for most customer orders cboe also has a volume incentive program or vip which pays credits to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of business at the exchange 

in 2012 and january 2013 c2 used a makertaker pricing model for multiplylisted options products in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace receive a rebate in february 2013 c2 modified its pricing model for equity options to provide that marketmaker professional brokerdealer and firm transactions would be charged fees based on the width of the markets 

cfe utilizes a pricing model in which transaction fees vary depending on the type of market participant on whose behalf a trade is made and on whether the trade is executed through cfe’s trading system is a day trade or is a block trade or exchange of contract for related position transaction cfe also offers a day trade fee program that provides rebates on trades that qualify for the program 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 264  to 333  annually for 2012  our market share was 278  

the us options industry is extremely competitive and the competition has intensified we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaption and our reputation there are nine other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors including ise nyse arca nyse amex and nasdaq omx phlx we also compete against futures exchanges trading similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank legislation creates a category of marketplaces called a swap execution facility sef sefs will serve as marketplaces for the matching of swap transactions we expect to compete against futures exchanges and sefs to attract otc participants 

most options on equities and exchangetraded products or etps listed and traded on cboe and c2 are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges the options exchanges have been introducing new pricing models over the last few years in order to attempt to attract additional trades to their exchanges these pricing models include traditional pricing makertaker and ownership benefits see trends  cost competition 

our competitive challenge is to convince brokerdealers to route options orders to our exchanges rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their market making activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on individual equity securities and etps which tend to be traded on multiple exchanges we compete through a variety of methods including

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion covers the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

limit uplimit down and marketwide circuit breakers 

in may 2012 the sec approved a limit uplimit down plan intended to prevent trades in regulation nms stocks from occurring outside of specific price bands to reduce market volatility the bands will be set around the average reference price of the security over the immediately preceding fiveminute period in certain cases a trading pause in a stock can occur pursuant to the plan while only applying to stocks the plan will likely impact options trading as option prices are derived in part from underlying stock prices at the same time as the limit uplimit down plan announcement the sec also announced revisions to the marketwide circuit breakers the revisions reduced the market decline percentage thresholds for triggering a circuit breaker shortened the duration of trading halts reduced the number of trigger time periods replaced the dow jones industrial average with the sp as the pricing reference and increased the frequency of the calculation of the thresholds to daily both of these plans are scheduled to be implemented by all us exchanges in the first half of 2013 cfe will also be implementing the revised marketwide circuit breakers 

consolidated audit trail cat 

in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory organizations or sros through a new rule to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail cat which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us markets the rule requires among other things that upon implementation of a plan data be reported to a central repository by 8 am eastern time the following day by each exchange and broker dealer we are working with the other sros to develop the plan to implement a consolidated audit trail which is required to detail technological and compliance aspects of the plan and the costs to implement the plan among other details the sros are required to submit the plan by april 26 2013 although the sros have requested an extension under december 2013 with a phased implementation over the three years following the effectiveness of the plan the exchanges and their participants are likely to incur significant costs related to the implementation of the consolidated audit trail requirements 

cftc core principles 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act in 2012 the cftc adopted a number of new regulations applicable to designated contract markets in order to implement the amended core principles these regulations related to among other things compliance with rules prevention of market disruption financial integrity of transactions disciplinary procedures system safeguards and financial resources as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to these new requirements 

agency rulemaking areas 

in addition to the above identified areas the sec has been directed under doddfrank to implement many new rules both alone and in conjunction with the cftc these areas include portfolio margining and swap clearing and execution 

finally the sec has proposed rules including option fee caps and banning flash orders that it has not acted upon while we do not expect the sec to take action with respect to option fee caps or banning flash orders as these proposals are dated if one or both of the proposals were adopted they could cause significant changes to our market that may reduce our revenue per contract or reduce the volume of trading on our exchanges 

compliance 

securities industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities markets and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organization sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec cbsx which is not an sro is a stock trading facility of cboe as a facility cboe is responsible for the regulation of the cbsx marketplace and the following discussion of cboes responsibilities includes the responsibility to provide regulation for cbsx and cboes other facilities 

sros in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the sec before beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the exchange has the capacity to carry out the purposes of the exchange act an sro must comply with the exchange act and have the ability to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of our exchanges rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve or disapprove the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that the cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act certain categories of rule changes like fee changes can be effective on filing but the sec retains the ability to suspend such filings within a prescribed period of time 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are also subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure fair representation of trading permit holders in the selection of cboe and c2 directors public participation in the governance of cboe and c2 and that cboe and c2 can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of cboe and c2 and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of cboe c2 or national stock exchange inc nsx relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out their responsibilities under the exchange act cboe is committed to support nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to the exchanges the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market that is subject to the oversight of the cftc under its principlesbased approach and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act cfe has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

the national futures association nfa performs many of these functions for cfe pursuant to a regulatory services agreement with cfe cfe retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace cfe also remains responsible for bringing disciplinary actions against trading privilege holders including the ability to issue fines in the case of serious rule violations in the case of financially distressed trading privilege holders cfe may take various emergency actions to protect customers other trading privilege holders and cfe cfe is also a party to cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements with other sros and is a member of the intermarket surveillance group 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act in 2012 the cftc adopted a number of new regulations applicable to designated contract markets in order to implement the amended core principles these regulations relate to among other things compliance with rules prevention of market disruption financial integrity of transactions disciplinary procedures system safeguards and financial resources as a result cfe implemented a number of new rules policies and procedures in relation to these new requirements 

regulatory responsibilities 

our options exchanges are responsible for assessing the compliance of their trading permit holders with the respective exchanges rules and the applicable rules of the sec the main activities that the exchanges engage in to measure compliance with these rules include 1 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect violations of exchange trading rules 2 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect possible manipulation and violations of other sec rules 3 the further investigation of matters deemed to be problematic upon review of the exception reports or matters deemed to be problematic as a result of examinations 4 the investigation of complaints about possible rule violations brought by 

customers members or other sros and 5 the examination of cboe and c2 trading permit holders for compliance with rules such as those related to net capital books and records market access and other matters related to the trading permit holders exchange business function as further described below each option exchange is also responsible for reviewing its trading permit holders activities related to the conduct of business directly with public customers or sales practice we have delegated the responsibility to conduct sales practice examinations for options to finra except that we retain responsibility for some of the sales practice examinations of trading permit holders that are not also members of finra or another us securities exchange 

section 17d of the exchange act and the related exchange act rules permit sros to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation under exchange act rule 17d1 the sec designates one sro to be the designated examining authority dea for each brokerdealer that is a member of more than one sro the dea is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the financial responsibility aspects of that brokerdealer we are the dea for many of our members 

exchange act rule 17d2 permits sros to enter into agreements commonly called rule 17d2 agreements which are approved by the sec and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those sros and relating to members those sros have in common we have entered into rule 17d2 agreements under which finra is allocated responsibility for enforcing rules related to options sales practices with respect to cboe and c2 trading permit holders and insider trading rules and certain other rules with respect to cbsx trading permit holders we have entered into another rule 17d2 agreement that allocates responsibility to each sro for ensuring that their allocated common members complied with rules governing expiring exercise declarations options position limits and large options position reporting and position adjustments finally we have entered into a rule 17d2 agreement that allocates certain responsibilities under regulation nms to a market participants dea 

the sec approved a national market system plan named the options regulatory surveillance authority plan orsa plan with the purpose of permitting the us securities options exchanges to act jointly in the administration operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed material information in trading in one or more of their markets through the sharing of the costs of these regulatory activities and the sharing of the regulatory information generated under the orsa plan the orsa plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and the national market system for options and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts the orsa policy committee delegated the operation of the surveillance and investigative facility contemplated by the orsa plan to cboe the exchanges have entered into a regulatory services agreement with cboe as service provider pursuant to which cboe performs certain regulatory and surveillance functions under the orsa plan and uses its automated insider trading surveillance system to perform these functions on behalf of the exchanges 

cboe has entered into regulatory services agreements with other exchanges under which cboe provides certain regulatory services to those exchanges cboe is currently providing service to two exchanges under regulatory services agreements 

in order to ensure market integrity we extensively regulate and monitor our trading permit holders trading activities providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of marketmakers brokerdealers and institutional and retail investors 

we expend considerable time financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities exchange industry and within the regulatory regime overseen by the sec our primary regulator in order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our option exchange rules we have developed our own automated market surveillance systems to monitor market activity on our option exchanges and across us options markets

 item 1a risk factors 

certain statements contained in this report under various sections including business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see forwardlooking statements these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our exclusive licenses to list certain index options could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and the djia granted to us by the owners of such indexes in 2012  approximately 36  of our transaction fees were generated by our exclusivelylicensed index products the bulk of which are attributable to our sp 500 index option products which are our largest products by revenue as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although court decisions have allowed the trading of options on etfs based on indexes without licenses from the owners of the underlying indexes none of these decisions has overturned existing legal precedent that requires an exchange to be licensed by the owner of an underlying index before it may list options based on the index however in two pending cases international securities exchange inc or ise is seeking a judicial determination that it and by extension other options exchanges has the right to list options on the sp 500 index and the djia without licenses and therefore without regard to our exclusive licenses to list options on those indexes see legal proceedings 

because these cases are still pending there remains a risk that ise may be successful in obtaining a judicial determination eliminating the right of index owners to require licenses to use their indexes for options trading in addition competing exchanges may convince the sec or seek a judicial action to limit the right of index owners to grant exclusive licenses for index options trading or to prevent exchanges from entering into such exclusive licenses if unlicensed trading of index options were permitted or if exclusive licenses for index options trading were prohibited or limited we likely would lose 

market share in these index options an adverse ruling in the ise litigation could also result in legal challenges to our exclusive use of our proprietary indexes for options trading 

there is also a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses especially for the sp 500 index for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased products that are economically similar to those for which we have exclusive licenses it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition in addition the number of options exchanges with which we compete has increased the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and we and our competitors have adjusted our transaction fees and fee structures accordingly these changes have resulted in significant pricing and cost pressures on us especially on transaction fees for our multiplylisted products it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them as a result of these competitive developments our market share of total options traded in the us fell from approximately 333  in 2008 to approximately 278  in 2012  

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume in january 2013 one of our competitors introduced an aggressive pricing strategy that we believe has reduced our market share while we responded by changing our fee schedule there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain or maintain market share or that any of our competitors may not introduce even more aggressive pricing strategies 

like nearly all of the other options exchanges our options exchanges charge an options regulatory fee or orf to trading permit holders based on the total number of customer contracts executed or cleared by that trading permit holder regardless of the exchange on which the trade is executed along with fines and other regulatory fees the orf revenues may only be used to support our regulatory functions we may face competitive pressures to reduce or not increase the orfs on our exchanges and if we are unable to maintain or if necessary increase the orf our results of operation may be adversely affected 

if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected for example we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations or sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec in addition cbsx is a stock trading facility of cboe and cboe regulates cbsx in december 2011 cbsx acquired nsx a registered national securities exchange that offer a market for trading stocks while nsx is not a facility of cboe in the acquisition cboe committed to support nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities cboe has also entered into agreements with certain other exchanges to provide regulatory services 

to those exchanges cfe is a designated contract market registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc 

in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the firms that trade on our exchanges while we have entered into agreements under which other sros with respect to our options exchanges and nfa with respect to our futures exchange provide certain regulatory services we retain significant obligations to regulate our trading permit holders especially on our options markets see business  regulatory responsibilities 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and designated contract markets respectively pursuant to applicable laws rules and regulations 

the staff of the sec is currently investigating cboes compliance with its obligations as a selfregulatory organization under the federal securities laws see item 3  legal proceedings while an agreement has not been reached with the sec staff we believe that any resolution of this matter would likely include a monetary penalty and may require cboe to make additional changes to its compliance programs and procedures a resolution of this matter may also involve other remedies within the secs authority 

in addition to what is described above if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement and compliance to be deficient cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of an exchanges registration as a national securities exchange any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs the diversion of resources including management time and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe or c2 may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

recently we have significantly increased the size of our regulatory division and hired a chief compliance officer to assist us in meeting our sec and cftc legal and regulatory obligations if we are unable to successfully manage and integrate these new employees we may be unable to meet our legal and regulatory obligations 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with the cboe and c2 see regulatory environment and compliance—regulatory responsibilities 

in addition we are performing certain regulatory services for orsa and two exchanges with which we are not otherwise affiliated under regulatory services agreements while the exchanges for which we provide regulatory services remain ultimately responsible for their respective regulatory responsibilities if we are unable to perform under these agreements we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by the sec and may be liable to the entities for which we provide services and their end users 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2012  2011  and 2010  approximately 70  73  and 76  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis  operating revenues  average 

transaction fee per contract if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower transaction fee per contract products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec cftc or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros could materially affect our markets in recent years the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while certain of its requirements have been implemented many of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs 

also in 2012 the sec directed the selfregulatory agencies to submit a plan to create implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the us markets in addition to increased regulatory obligations implementation of a consolidated audit trail could result in significant additional expenditures including to implement any new technology to meet any plans requirements 

it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses including in response to recent incidents that have disrupted operations on certain other exchanges although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

in addition congress the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the options or futures industry at all any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution functionality and ease of use of our trading platform range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the nine other us options exchanges we also compete against investment banks and other entities that trade options overthecounter see also our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

 22 

 the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 general economic conditions affect options trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world for only the second time in twenty years in 2012 total us options volume is down from the prior year adverse changes in the economy can have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume because our structure and overhead costs are based on assumptions of certain levels of market activity significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index and futures products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index and futures products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business for a description of current litigation involving among other things these matters please see legal proceedings 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for a discussion of patent litigation involving us please see legal proceedings 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees account for a significant portion of our operating revenues  125  in 2012  cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and network services including the systems that comprise cboe command the platform for trading on our exchanges if we are unable to operate monitor or maintain these systems or program them so that they operate correctly it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we have a complete backup of our primary data center the backup systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach 

our systems may fail in whole or in part or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 any of these events may cause 

 

as a consequence of any of these events our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

in addition to other measures we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume or times of unusual market volatility however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems including the systems that calculate and transmit our index values and our communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control if our security measures are compromised or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including harm to reputation and litigation caused by any breaches in security or system failures measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities there may be a conflict of interest between our regulatory responsibilities and the interests of some of our market participants or our own business interests any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with sec and cftc laws and regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed we have implemented new compliance policies and procedures in response to an ongoing review of our compliance with our selfregulatory responsibilities see item 3  legal proceedings if these new policies and procedures are not effective we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business in december 2012 we announced a management transition to be effected following the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders in which mr brodsky will become executive chairman mr tilly will become chief executive officer and mr provost will become president and chief operating officer the failure to retain members of our management team and successfully implement our management transition could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our regulatory and technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems and regulatory personnel could result in systems errors or regulatory infractions consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

in recent years we have launched a new options exchange experienced significant increased volume on our futures exchange and significantly increased the staff in our regulatory division we expect that our business will grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures and we will need to continue to expand train and 

manage our workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology accounting finance marketing sales regulatory and compliance functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including banking and clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms the host of our data center processors of market information such as the consolidated tape association and opra and various vendors of communications and networking products and services we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes also the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe our futures exchange the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business decisions 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may not approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and various groups have specifically targeted the financial services industry due to its perceived role in the current economic and political climate at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any cases of data theft corruption of data or compromised customer data in february 2012 web sites for cboe and other exchanges were targeted with a large distributed denial of service attack while this attack lasted only a day affected only internetbased systems and had minimal impact on cboe’s overall trading activities the potential for more serious attacks in the future exists 

security breaches may have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

misconduct by our customers or others could harm us 

we run the risk that our trading permit holders other persons who use our markets or our employees will engage in fraud or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation especially because we are the parent company of multiple sros and a designated contract market it is not always possible to deter misconduct and 

the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

changes in the tax structure affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in early 2013 the chairman of the house ways and means committee introduced a discussion draft of a proposed reform to the taxation of financial products including repealing the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income requiring all derivatives to be markedtomarket and eliminating the exemption for qualified covered calls this discussion draft is in addition to similar proposals from other tax reformers and draft legislation in prior congressional sessions in addition federal and state legislation may be introduced that would impose a new tax on certain financial transactions including exchangetraded options transaction tax legislation has been proposed in illinois and the european union has proposed adopting a transaction tax which if adopted may lead to calls for a similar tax in the united states 

if the proposed tax law changes a transaction tax or other tax change that detrimentally impacts options or futures trading were to become law the resulting tax law could have a negative impact on the options industry and us by making options transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading in options in addition other states are attempting to increase tax revenues by asserting that they have nexus over certain companies if another state were to successfully assert nexus against us we may experience a higher marginal state tax rate 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect the market price of our unrestricted common stock 

we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for us that a stockholder might consider favorable these include provisions 

 in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

in addition delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

our principal offices are located at 400 south lasalle street chicago illinois 60605 through our whollyowned subsidiary chicago options exchange building corporation we own the building in which our principal offices are located and occupy approximately 300000 square feet of this building in addition to our principal offices we also lease additional office space we lease 23828 square feet of office space at 111 west jackson boulevard chicago illinois 60604 which houses our regulatory division the lease on this space expires in 2014 and contains an option to renew for an additional two years we lease a 2881 square foot office at 61 broadway new york new york 10006 the lease on this space expires in 2017 and includes an option to renew for another five years we lease approximately 2500 square feet of space in new jersey for our data center the lease on that space expires in 2017 and includes an automatic twelve month renewal unless the agreement is terminated by either party finally we lease 1650 square feet of space outside the city of chicago for a remote network operations center the lease on that facility expires at the end of 2015 

we believe the space we occupy is sufficient to meet our current and future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2012  the end of the period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 

the company reviews its legal proceedings and claims regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions the company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading the company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the 

liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote the companys assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals 

estimates of probable losses resulting from patent litigation involving the company are inherently difficult to make particularly when the companys view of the case is significantly different than that expressed by the plaintiff the company has not recorded a liability related to damages in connection with these matters 

as of december 31 2012  the company does not think that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these reviews inspections or other legal proceedings if any has been incurred while the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on our earnings in any given reporting period 

index options litigation 

on november 15 2006 cboe the mcgrawhill companies inc mcgrawhill and cme group index services llc substituted for dow jones  co dow jones asserted claims in the circuit court of cook county illinois against ise and its parent company ise seeking a declaration to prevent ise from offering spx and djx options and to prevent occ from issuing and clearing such options ise filed a lawsuit on november 2 2006 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a declaration that the rights asserted by mcgrawhill and dow jones are preempted by federal law the new york action is currently pending but has been stayed in light of the illinois action the illinois court has permanently restrained and enjoined ise from listing or providing an exchange market for the trading of spx and djx options and enjoined occ from issuing clearing or settling the exercise of such ise options the illinois appellate court affirmed the lower courts ruling on may 25 2012 and the illinois supreme court denied ises appeal of this decision ise filed a petition for certiorari with the us supreme court on january 25 2013

ise  707 

on november 22 2006 ise filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that cboes hybrid trading system infringes ises us patent no 6618707 the 707 patent on january 31 2007 cboe filed an action in federal court in the northern district of illinois seeking a declaratory judgment that the 707 patent was not infringed not valid andor not enforceable against cboe the new york case was transferred to the northern district of illinois on august 9 2007 the trial in this case is scheduled to begin in march 2013 

on august 15 2012 c2 filed a declaratory judgment complaint against ise in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that the 707 patent is not valid not infringed and not enforceable in light of decisions in the cboe case involving the same patent 

ise  qrm 

on november 12 2012 cboe brought suit against ise in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that ise infringes three patents related to quote risk monitor qrm technology cboe has requested injunctive relief and monetary damages on february 20 2013 the court ruled that the case be transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york where it will proceed 

sec matter 

as previously reported in the companys periodic filings the staff of the sec is investigating cboes compliance with its obligations as a selfregulatory organization under the federal securities laws we continue to cooperate with the investigation and cboe is conducting its own review of its compliance and has modified its compliance program we have commenced discussions with the sec staff aimed at resolving the investigation and such discussions remain ongoing while an agreement has not been reached with the sec staff we believe that any resolution of this matter would include a monetary penalty and may require cboe to make additional changes to its compliance programs and procedures a resolution of this matter may also involve other remedies within the secs authority during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company recorded a charge of 50 million related to this matter which is included in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2012  respectively there is currently no definitive agreement with the sec staff for the resolution of this matter we believe that it is reasonably possible that the company could incur a charge in connection with this matter of up to 10 million and any agreement will be subject to the approval by the commissioners of the sec therefore there can be no assurance that the companys negotiations with the sec staff will result in a definitive agreement and the amount of the monetary penalty upon final disposition of these 

matters may exceed the amount we have accrued however we believe that the likelihood of any additional monetary penalty in excess of the upper limit of the range set forth above is remote 

other 

as a selfregulatory organization under the jurisdiction of the sec with respect to cboe and c2 and as a designated contract market under the jurisdiction of the cftc with respect to cfe we are subject to routine reviews and inspections by the sec and the cftc 

we are also currently a party to various other legal proceedings including those already mentioned management does not believe that the outcome of any of these other reviews inspections or other legal proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview 

the primary business of the company is the operation of markets for the trading of listed options contracts on three broad product categories 1 the stocks of individual corporations equity options 2 various market indexes index options and 3 other exchangetraded products etp options such as exchangetraded funds etf options and exchangetraded notes etn options we also offer futures products through a futures market the company owns and operates three standalone exchanges but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment cboe is our primary market and offers trading for listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single exchange is known as our hybrid trading model c2 is our allelectronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options but with a different market model and fee schedule than cboe finally cfe our allelectronic futures exchange offers futures on the vix index as well as on other products all of our exchanges operate on our proprietary technology platform known as cboe command 

restructuring transaction 

on june 18 2010 cboe converted from a nonstock corporation owned by its members into a stock corporation that is a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe holdings 

  

in the consolidated statements of income for cboe holdings for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 net income per share allocated to common stockholders is calculated by dividing historical net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares as if the restructuring transaction were consummated at the beginning of the period 

components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fee revenue transaction fee revenue is a function of three variables 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume and 3 transaction mix between contract type because trading fees are assessed on a per contract basis exchange fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are primarily influenced by factors outside its control including price competition price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis transaction fee revenue accounted for 697  734  and 756  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the main option categories traded are equities indexes and etps the equity options category reflects trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies the index options category reflects trading in index options contracts on market indexes and on the interest rates of us treasury securities the etp options category includes etf options that are options on baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index but which trade like individual stocks and etn options that are options on senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities issued by an underwriting bank futures are standardized transferable exchangetraded contracts that require delivery of a commodity bond currency or stock index at a specified price and on a specified future date 

the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the increasing use of options represents a longterm trend that will continue in the future furthermore we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the overthecounter market to exchanges 

while there is no certainty we expect that the industrywide and companyspecific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes however additional factors may arise that could also impact contract trading volume which may result in increases or decrease in our contract trading volume such as new or 

existing competition or other events considering these factors we do not expect recent trading volumes to be an indicator of future trading volume 

access fees 

access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit holders for the opportunity to trade and use other related functions of cboe the program contains a tierbased marketmaker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and in the case of marketmakers the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products the number of trading permits made available are limited 

on july 1 2010 the company began charging monthly fees to trading permit holders under a trading access program the trading access program could be impacted by seasonality and market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

prior to july 1 2010 access fees represented fees assessed to temporary members and interim trading permit holders for the right to trade at cboe and dues charged to members the fees assessed temporary members and interim trading permit holders were based on average lease rates and the number of temporary access points and interim trading permits 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers trading floor space technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and through our subsidiary market data express llc mdx through mdx we sell historical options data as well as realtime data for certain proprietary products and indexes it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets a highavailability low latency streaming data feed opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges and is authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data cboe and c2 are members of a management committee with other member exchanges that administer the opra limited liability company agreement revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter opra is not consolidated with the company 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as selfregulatory organizations under the exchange act cboe and c2 charge the options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industrywide customer volume of trading permit holders this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holder declines and rates are not increased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease 

the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions some of which are included in this revenue category and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses mainly in employee costs and outside services

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition

deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  asc 740 and arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the company files tax returns for federal state and local income tax purposes a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 

if the company considers that a tax position is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position it recognizes the tax benefit the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position to the extent that the companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months interest and penalties if any are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the companys consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits

overview 

the following summarizes changes in financial performance for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  



 significant events in 2012   

total cleared contract volume in 2012 reached 40 billion contracts a 12 decline from the 2011 record volume of 46 billion contracts as reported by the occ despite this decline 2012 marks the second highest year for cleared contract volume to date and the second consecutive year in which volume surpassed 4 billion contracts 

we experienced strong growth in vix options and futures in 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the prior year period we experienced increases in total volume in vix options and futures of of 130  and 992  respectively we believe the growth is due to a broader customer base and our commitment to investor education

 operating revenues 

total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012   increased   42 million  or 08  to 5123 million  from 5081 million  in the prior year the following summarizes changes in total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  



transaction fees 

transaction fees decreased   43  to 3571 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  representing 697  of total operating revenues compared with 3731 million  for the prioryear period or 734  of total operating revenues this decrease was largely driven by a decrease in trading volume of 68  partially offset by a 26  increase in the average transaction fee per contract the increase in average transaction fee per contract is impacted primarily by fee changes implemented during the year which increased the rate per contract on indexes and futures and decreased the rate per contract on multiplylisted options products and the mix of products traded 

although our share of total exchangetraded options contracts increased to 278  from 264  from the prior year period overall trading volume decreased trading volume is impacted by many factors these factors include macroeconomic events market volatility regulatory actions or considerations availability of capital competition number of trading days in the period and seasonality 

  

average transaction fee per contract discussed in greater detail below is impacted by our fee structure which includes volume based incentive programs mix of products traded and the percentage of trading volume executed by customers as compared to professionals marketmakers clearing trading permit holders and brokerdealers the implementation of fee changes which may increase or decrease our average transaction fee per contract is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges we cannot predict the trading patterns of exchange participants which may be based on factors not in our control but we can continue to price our products at levels that are competitive in our markets 

the following summarizes transaction fees by product category for 2012  compared to 2011  



trading volume 

the companys average daily trading volume adv was 454 million contracts in 2012  a decrease of 60  compared with 483 million for 2011  total trading days in 2012  and 2011  were two hundred fifty and two hundred fiftytwo respectively due to the impact of hurricane sandy all exchanges were closed two days in october 2012 resulting in no trading activity on those days 

the company experienced a decrease in volume in each options product category the company continued to experience significant growth in futures primarily driven by futures contracts on the vix index the following summarizes changes in total trading volume and adv by product for 2012  compared to 2011  



the following provides the percentage of volume by product category for the year ended december 31 2012  and 2011  



average transaction fee per contract 

the average transaction fee per contract was 0315  in 2012  an increase of 26  compared with 0307  in 2011  average transaction fee per contract represents transaction fees divided by total contracts in general the company faces continued downward pressure on transaction fees for multiplylisted products equities and etps in the markets in which we compete 

the following summarizes average transaction fee per contract by product for 2012  compared to 2011  



there are a number of factors that contributed to the increase in our total average transaction fee per contract in 2012  compared to 2011  these include 

 

 

 at december 31 2012  there were one hundred five cboe clearing firms two of which cleared a combined 45 of our billings collected through the occ in 2012  the next largest clearing firm accounted for approximately 5 of our billings collected through the occ no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing firms represented more than 15 of the revenue collected through the occ in 2012  or 2011  for the respective clearing firm should a clearing firm withdraw from cboe we believe the trading permit holder portion of that firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm 

the two largest clearing firms mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe c2 and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these firms were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to make new clearing arrangements this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including ours 

access fees 

access fees for the year ended december 31 2012   decreased  to 641 million  from 687 million  in the comparable prior year period representing 125  and 135  of total operating revenues for 2012 and 2011  respectively the decrease in access fees was primarily due to fee adjustments implemented in 2012 for marketmaker trading permits which lowered both the fee and pricing for monthly trading permits under the marketmaker trading permit sliding scale marketmakers that committed to a minimum number of trading permits for the calendar year qualified for a discounted monthly rate 

the demand for trading permits could be impacted by seasonality and market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2012   increased   725  to 314 million  from 182 million  in the comparable period in the prior year resulting primarily from pricing increases for services such as connectivity to cboe   command   through network access ports and client application services 

market data fees 

market data fees increased   224  to 243 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  from 199 million  in the prior year market data fees represent income derived from opra as well as the companys market data services opra and company market data fees for the years ended 2012  and 2011  were 150 million  and 93 million  and 129 million  and 70 million  respectively opra income is allocated through opra based on each exchanges share of total cleared options transactions the companys share of opra income for the period ended december 31 2012  increased to 244  from 214  for the same period in 2011  as a result of an increase in the companys share of total cleared options transactions revenue generated from the companys market data services which provide current and historical options and futures data increased 23 million  resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers to cboe streaming markets and other market data services and an increase in subscriber rates 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees increased   91  for the year ended 2012  to 210 million  from 192 million  in the same period in the prior year resulting from cboe increasing its options regulatory fee rate and c2 implementing an options regulatory fee these fee changes were partially offset by lower trading permit holder customer volume industrywide as compared to the same period in 2011  

the companys regulatory fees are primarily based on the number of customer contracts traded throughout the listed united states options industry under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes on january 1 2013 the company increased the options regulatory fee rate cover increasing costs associated with the companys regulatory responsibilities see explanation of employees costs within employees costs regarding regulatory staffing 

other revenue 

other revenue increased   54 million  to 144 million  for the year ended 2012  compared with 90 million  for the comparable period in 2011  this increase primarily reflects fines assessed to trading permit holders from disciplinary actions under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   17 million  or 06  to 2682 million  for the year ended 2012  from 2665 million  in the year ago period resulting from higher costs associated with outside services and other expenses partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and trading volume incentives expenses decreased  to 523  of total operating revenues in the year ended 2012  compared with 525  in the same period in 2011  

the following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  



employee costs 

for the year ended december 31 2012  employee costs were 1042 million  or 203  of total operating revenues compared with 1045 million  or 206  of total operating revenues in the same period in 2011  this represented a decrease  of 03 million  or 03  resulting from decreases in accrued incentive compensation which is aligned with the companys 

performance targets of 09 million  and severance expense of 05 million  partially offset by an increase in salaries of 14 million  resulting from increases in staffing primarily for regulatory functions 

in september 2012 the company announced a reduction in force which resulted in the elimination of 30 positions and severance charges of 21 million total headcount at the end of 2012 as compared to the beginning of the period remained relatively constant as the eliminated staff positions were mostly offset by newly added staff positions primarily for regulatory functions in 2011 the company recorded severance expenses of 37 million due to the departure of a senior executive pursuant to his employment agreement with the company 

we expect stockbased compensation expense to be higher in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase is primarily attributed to restricted stock granted on february 6 2013 for which the company will recorded accelerated stockbased compensation in the first quarter of 2013   to recognize the fair value of stock awards granted to certain executives due to provisions contained in their respective agreements regarding employment in the second quarter of 2013 the company will record stockbased compensation expense related to the transition of management as described in significant events 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization decreased  by 26 million  to 315 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with 341 million  for the same period in 2011  depreciation and amortization charges represented 61  and 67  of total operating revenues for the years ended 2012  and 2011  respectively 

data processing 

data processing expenses increased   17 million  to 196 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with 179 million  in the prioryear period representing 38  and 35  of total operating revenues in the years ended 2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in data processing expenses is primarily due to an increase in hardware and software maintenance relating to the migration of the cboe and cfe data centers to new jersey and various other software upgrades 

outside services 

expenses related to outside services increased  to 363 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  from 273 million  in the prioryear period and represented 71  and 54  of total operating revenues in the years ended 2012  and 2011  respectively the 90 million  increase primarily resulted from higher expenses for costs relating to legal proceedings costs associated with the companys review of regulatory compliance and audit and accounting fees partially attributed to additional work related to the recognition of a certain discrete tax deduction 

royalty fees 

royalty fees for the year ended december 31 2012  were 461 million  compared with 478 million  for the prior year period a decrease  of 17 million  primarily resulting from lower trading volume in licensed products royalty fees represented 90  and 94  of total operating revenues for the years ended 2012  and 2011  respectively 

trading volume incentives 

trading volume incentives decreased   79 million  to 63 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 142 million  for the same period a year ago representing 12  and 28  of total operating revenues in the years ended 2012  and 2011  respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in multiplylisted options products equities and exchangetraded products a modification in the criteria for contracts qualifying for certain quantitybased fee waivers and an adjustment to the fees paid by the company for transactions linked to away exchanges 

other expense 

in 2012 the company accrued an estimated expense of 50 million   for a potential liability related to an sec investigation of cboes compliance with its obligations as a selfregulatory organization under the federal securities laws while an agreement has not been reached with the sec we believe that any resolution of this matter would likely include a monetary penalty and may require cboe to make additional changes to its compliance programs and procedures there is currently no definitive agreement with the sec staff for the resolution of this matter see part i item 3 legal proceedings for additional information 

operating income 

as a result of the items above operating income in 2012  was 2441 million  compared to 2416 million  in 2011  an increase  of 25 million  

other expense 

net loss from investment in affiliates 

net loss from investment in affiliates was 17 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with 08 million  for the same period in the prior year the loss in 2012  reflected the companys share of the operating loss of signal trading systems llc the loss in 2011  reflected the companys share of the operating loss of signal trading systems llc and the impairment of the carrying value of our investment in nsx holdings inc the company no longer holds a direct investment in nsx due to the acquisition of nsx by cbsx in december 2011 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys interest in signal trading systems llc

overview

 45 

 significant events in 2011   

the company and the options industry experienced higher trading volumes during 2011 we believe the higher volume was achieved due to volatility and movements in the financial markets arising primarily out of domestic and international uncertainties surrounding certain political events such as the continued budget issues in washington dc and the economic unrest and sovereign debt issues in europe 

pursuant to an employment agreement with a senior executive the company recorded 37 million in severance expense for payments in connection with his departure from the company which is included in employee costs in the consolidated statement of income for the period ended december 31 2011

our primary business of offering exchangetraded options and futures is part of the large and growing global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from some other underlying asset or reference value these underlying assets and reference values include individual stocks stock indexes debt instruments interest rates currencies commodities and various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies in recent years derivatives have also been developed on economic indicators and artificial assets such as pollution rights the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

exchangetraded options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset options on us securities are traded privately between two parties known as overthecounter or otc options as well as traded on us securities exchanges the vast majority of derivatives traded on us securities exchanges are options on individual 

equities market indexes and etfs overthecounter options that are traded also include options on individual equities etfs and indexes including options on the sp 500 index 

futures represent a contract in which the buyer and seller agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment an option on a futures contract is a right but not an obligation to buy or sell a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date 

trading 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3300 underlying stocks etfs and indexes the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including both specialists and marketmakers is a key feature of the options markets specialists and marketmakers provide continuous bids and offers for substantially all listed option series in return for these commitments specialists and marketmakers receive margin exemptions as well as other incentives such as participation rights and fee incentives 

until 2000 trading in options products on us options exchanges traditionally occurred primarily on physical trading floors in areas called pits through an auction process known as open outcry which refers to facetoface trading over the past decade electronic access has allowed exchange participants including those at cboe to provide electronic bids and offers without being physically present on the trading floor now all of the us options exchanges either exclusively or in combination with open outcry trading provide electronic trading platforms that allow participants to submit bids offers and orders directly into the exchanges trading system as a result many liquidity providers now operate remotely away from the physical trading floors and the majority of options trading volume is executed electronically 

trends 

consolidation 

perceived economies of scale have driven a wave of consolidation among exchange holding companies over the last several years for example nyse euronext now owns both nyse arca and nyse amex deutsche borse has acquired the international securities exchange and nasdaq omx owns both the philadelphia stock exchange phlx and nasdaq options market nom while some recent transactions have failed to gain approval from foreign regulators we believe competitive pressures and the scalability of trading platforms continue to provide a compelling rationale for further consolidation 

makertaker pricing structure 

several options exchanges including c2 for multiplylisted classes utilize a different pricing model than cboe in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace may receive a rebate for doing so both dependent on origin type this kind of fee schedule known as makertaker is attractive to participants who regularly provide liquidity but not necessarily to firms representing customer orders as those orders are generally takers of liquidity 

high frequency trading 

high frequency trading refers to the practice of entering buy and sell orders in rapid succession often as many as thousands of orders per second the strategies pursued by high frequency traders depend on sophisticated algorithms to spot trends before others can react to them and to exploit minor fluctuations in securities prices its practitioners are professional traders who typically use highspeed computers colocated at exchanges with direct connections to exchange order routing systems to reduce latency high frequency trading has driven up trading volume on equity exchanges and is estimated to account for from 50 to 70 of stock trading it currently plays a small but growing role in options markets and has led many exchanges to create a new category of market participant known as professional customer which enables those exchanges to charge different fees than on other customer orders

 proprietary products 

the company has developed several of its own proprietary indexes and index methodologies these include volatility based on various broadbased market indexes such as the sp 500 the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell 2000 volatility indexes based on etfs and individual stocks the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index and a series of option strategy benchmarks including buywrite putwrite and collar indexes based on the sp 500 and buywrite indexes based on other broadbased market indexes we also have licensed others to use some of these indexes to create products and have entered into agreements whereby we have granted to others the rights to sublicense some of these indexes the company generates revenue from the calculation and dissemination of over thirty realtime index values for third party licensors and from the licensing of our proprietary indexes 

strategic relationships 

the company also has longterm business relationships with several providers of market indexes we license their indexes as the basis for index options in some instances these licenses provide us with the exclusive right to list options contracts based on these indexes of particular note are the following 

 market model 

cboe and c2 provide a reliable orderly liquid and efficient marketplace for the trading of options cboe operates a quotedriven auction market that employs a combination of specialists marketmakers floor brokers and electronic access permit firms order flow providers while c2 employs marketmakers and electronic access permit firms order flow providers only at cboe dpms see definition below are specialists that are charged with maintaining fair orderly and continuous markets in specific option classes either from the trading floor or remotely in certain heavily traded classes cboe assigns multiple remoteonly specialists edpms to enhance cboes competitive position in that product both dpms and edpms trade for their own accounts and are not permitted to act as agent on behalf of customers although they may be affiliated with large financial companies that also operate agency businesses marketmakers operating from remote locations or inperson on the trading floor supplement the liquidity provided by the specialists by quoting both bids and offers for their own accounts in their assigned classes floor brokers act as agents on the trading floor to facilitate primarily large or complicated orders that customers choose not to direct to the electronic system 

cboe and c2 offer different but complementary market models offering customers and participants a broad range of 

choices 

 market participants 

direct access to the cboe marketplace is granted to individuals and firms through trading permits a trading permit entitles the holder to conduct business on the exchange in one of the participant roles described below on c2 only firms can obtain trading permits 

 9 

five edpm firms at cboe covering 469 classes 

 several of the functions described above namely marketmaker dpm edpm and lmm are often grouped together as liquidity providers this name refers to the fact that they all provide liquidity to the options market through their various obligations to provide to the marketplace twosided quotes at which they are obligated to trade any of these liquidity providers may be designated as a preferred marketmaker by a member firm routing an order to cboe the preferred marketmaker is afforded a participation right on specific orders provided that he or she meets certain other requirements with respect to the relevant option class and quoting obligations 

trading permit holders 

purchasing a monthly marketmaker trading permit cboe c2 electronic access permit cboe c2 or floor broker trading permit cboe for the respective exchange conveys trading permit holder status on the respective exchange to the permit holder for cboe additional tier appointments are required to act as a marketmaker in spx options or as a marketmaker or floor broker in vix options for c2 an additional tier appointment is required to act as a marketmaker in spxpm an electronic version of our sp 500 option product with pm settlement 

trading permit holders are brokerdealers and may include large banks proprietary trading firms brokerages and investment houses and clearing firms trading on our open outcry trading floor is conducted exclusively by trading permit holders in chicago trading permit holders can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other permit holders or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms 

trading permit holder status enables a marketmaker to submit electronic quotes into the trading system on cboe or c2 or make markets in open outcry on cboe trading permit holder status allows floor brokers on cboe to conduct business on the exchange floor or enter orders into the trading system trading permit holder status for electronic access permits allows the holder to enter electronic orders into the trading system a brokerdealer can apply for and hold a trading permit at cboe c2 or both—depending on the products intended to be traded rights and privileges of trading permits are exchangespecific 

trading permits 

 the quoting bandwidth allowance for a marketmaker trading permit is equivalent to a maximum of 312 million quotes over the course of a trading day to the extent a marketmaker is able to submit electronic quotes in a hybrid 30 class such as an lmm that streams quotes in the class or a marketmaker or lmm that streams quotes in a series of a hybrid 30 class that trades on the hybrid trading system the marketmaker receives the quoting bandwidth allowance to quote in and only in that class 

 10 

tier appointments 

in order for a marketmaker trading permit to be used to act as a marketmaker in either spx vix or spxpm the trading permit holder must obtain a tier appointment for the respective option class each tier appointment is classspecific tier appointments are exchangespecific 

applicants for trading permit holder status 

applicants for trading permit holder status must have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of trading permit holder status all trading permit holders must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them additionally they must comply with the provisions of the exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the sec 

our regulatory services division is the investigative arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules trading permit holders who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

cfe 

parties are required to have cfe trading privilege holder status in order to have trading privileges on cfe cfe has the flexibility to establish different trade allocation methods in its products for example the trade allocation method for vix futures is pricetime priority cfe also has the flexibility to appoint designated primary market markers dpms and to establish market maker programs in its products in light of the level of liquidity in vix futures cfe no longer has a dpm in vix futures and does not currently have a market maker program in that product 

trading privilege holders are required to pay a monthly access fee in addition to transaction fees for transactions on the exchange cfe trading privilege holders who are also cboe trading permit holders are eligible for certain lower transaction fees 

hybrid trading model 

most options are traded on cboe both electronically and in open outcry using its hybrid trading model both c2 and cfe are allelectronic exchanges 

we developed the first hybrid trading model in which aspects of both open outcry and electronic trading are integrated to function as a single market this trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe direct  trading platform since we began operating our hybrid trading model in 2003 a significant portion of the volume in our products has migrated to electronic execution 

the hybrid trading model enables cboe marketmakers to employ their own individual pricing models and to stream their own individual quotes and orders into the cboe trading engine cboe marketmakers present on the trading floor are able to both stream their quotes into cboes central trading engine and to participate in open outcry transactions effected in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer both electronic and open outcry trading models simultaneously without sacrificing the benefits each brings 

at the core of the hybrid trading model are the matching algorithms which is the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants cboes technology and rules provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers cboe has the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products and currently has two different algorithms in operation for various products each matching algorithm is designed to meet the needs of a particular market segment the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

our hybrid trading system calculates the national best bid and offer nbbo and orders are not executed at a price inferior to the displayed nbbo except pursuant to limited exceptions provided in cboes rules the system monitors all other option marketplaces and it has the capability to route orders to other marketplaces for execution if a better price exists elsewhere this linkage model is based on the regulation nms national market system intermarket linkage structure that exists for us equity trading the structure requires price protection of the exchanges bbo when they are at the nbbo and utilizes intermarket sweep orders isos to trade multiple prices at multiple exchanges nearly simultaneously undisplayed bids and offers and bids and offers at prices that are inferior to an exchanges bbo do not receive protection under this plan 

the hybrid trading system also supports offfloor participants including remote market making offfloor dpms and edpms currently edpms make markets in approximately 450 classes 

our market model continues to evolve and expand as we innovate and adapt to changes in the marketplace details on our 

technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers are described in technology 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded the market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years for cboe and c2 combined has ranged from 264  to 333 annually for 2011 our market share was 264  

the us options industry is extremely competitive we compete with a number of registered national securities exchanges and may compete with other exchanges or other trading venues in the future the seven other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors are bats options box ise nyse arca nyse amex nasdaq omx phlx and nom 

competition among options exchanges has intensified since cboe was created in 1973 and we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the seven other us options exchanges we also compete against futures exchanges trading similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives there are three futures exchanges that offer competing products the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank legislation creates a category of marketplaces called a swap execution facility sef sefs will serve as a market places for the matching of swap transactions we expect to compete against sefs to attract otc participants 

most equity options and options on etfs listed and traded on cboe and c2 are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in other options exchanges that compete with us which may give those firms an added incentive to direct orders to the exchanges in which they have ownership in addition several options exchanges utilize a pricing model in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace may receive a rebate for doing so both dependent on origin type this type of fee schedule known as makertaker is attractive to participants who regularly provide liquidity but not necessarily to firms representing customer orders as those orders are disproportionately takers of liquidity 

our competitive challenge is to convince brokerdealers to route options orders to cboe or c2 rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their market making activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on individual equity securities and etfs which tend to be traded on multiple exchanges we compete through a variety of methods including 

 technology 

our technology supports trading on multiple exchanges cboe c2 cfe cbsx and onechicago our systems can simultaneously support multiple trading models and multiple matching algorithms per exchange for example different products could trade simultaneously using open outcry screen based or a hybrid model within these trading models different products can be traded using different matching algorithms cboe direct  also supports trading options on futures we have licensed our platform for use by cbsx and onechicago 

trading platform 

cboe direct  the central platform for our hybrid trading system was launched in 2003 the cboe direct  platform integrates the cboe direct  trading engine with the routing display systems and broker handling systems that support the trading floor it provides features of screenbased and floorbased trading in what we believe is a best of both worlds market model 

cboe uses a quotedriven market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations the cboe direct  trade engine includes the match engine order book and quote processor cboe direct  accepts orders on behalf of all market participants and streaming quotes from marketmakers dpms edpms and lmms 

cboe direct  functionality includes multiple allocation algorithms a complex order book preferenced orders several auction mechanisms quote lock quote risk monitor and user input monitor the various allocation algorithms are configurable by product 

cboe directs  underlying technology is a java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and is designed to be scalable for capacity and throughput cboe direct  is capable of accommodating significantly more than the over 3000 options classes and over 300000 options series currently trading on it in addition to simple orders our systems support trading spreads and other complex orders as well as options that expire weekly in 2011 the company transmitted to opra peaks of over 990000 quotes per second 

cboe directs  design allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products in addition our system facilitates different trading models allowing us to provide both a floorbased model and a screenbased model 

cboe direct  provides application programming interfaces or apis to facilitate both quote and order entry as well as auction processing these include a proprietary api called cboe market interface cmi and the industrystandard financial information exchange fix 

 in 2012 cboe plans to launch cflex 20 built on the cboe direct  trade engine it will be the first trading system for flex options that is fully integrated with standard option trading capability 

order routing trade match ticker plant and market data 

the order routing system allows trading permit holders to use fix or cmi 

the trade match system uses cboe direct  technology it sends matched trades to the occ which settles and clears the trades the trade match system provides matched trade information to clearing firms via cboe direct  technology brokers have access to their trades and related account information via a webbased interface or through an api 

the ticker plant xtp takes in market data feeds from ctscqs opra nasdaq the cme group inc and other sources and disseminates the data internally to other systems on a publishsubscribe basis xtps most recent processing peak was 38 million messages per second or mps inbound from the opra with over 146 billion messages per day 

the system disseminates options market data to opra and to trading permit holders via fix cmi and csm csm is a new high speed multicast feed for distribution of current market data the system also uses ticker express to provide fast accurate market data to trading permit holders 

cfe disseminates futures market data via the cboe financial network cfn our futures market data network 

our fully integrated realtime system tracks electronic trading for help desk troubleshooting and regulatory analysis we have invested in an extensive data warehouse with terabytes of historical trading data that provides fast and easy access to data for analysis 

disaster recovery 

with two options exchanges we have multiple data center locations running on the same technology platform we use a remote data center to provide a point of redundancy for our cboe and cfe exchanges our remote facility fully replicates our primary cboe data center and is designed to ensure the operation of our platforms functionality in the face of external threats unforeseen disasters or internal failures in the event of an emergency cboe trading permit holders connecting to the cboe trading platform can route to the backup facility our primary data center continuously collects and saves all trade information and periodically transmits it to the backup facility for that reason we expect that our disaster recovery system would have current and in most cases realtime information in the event of a platform outage in the event that we were required to complete a changeover to a backup disaster facility we anticipate that our platform would experience minimal downtime 

clearing system 

the occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us options exchanges upon execution of an option trade we transmit to the occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes the occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on the cfe 

market data 

our markets generate valuable information regarding the prices of our products and the trading activity in those markets market data relating to price and size of market quotations and the price and size of trades is collected and consolidated by opra opra disseminates the information to vendors who redistribute the data to brokers investors and other persons or entities that use our markets or that monitor general economic conditions such as financial information providers brokerdealers banks futures commission merchants public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies hedge funds commodity pools individual investors and other financial services organizations after costs are deducted the fees collected are distributed among exchange participants based on their cleared transactions pursuant to the opra plan as of december 2011 our market data was displayed on approximately 170000 terminals worldwide see regulatory environment and compliance for further information on opra 

through our subsidiary mdx we are expanding our market data offerings mdx is a market data vendor providing information on specialized indexes time and sales information and specialized reports of historical market data 

support services

regulatory environment and compliance 

the following discussion cover the more significant areas of regulation of us by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

market access 

on november 3 2010 the sec adopted a new rule that would require brokers or dealers with access to trading directly on an exchange or automated trading system ats including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons to implement risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the financial regulatory and other risks of this business activity the new rule encompasses trading in all securities on an exchange or ats including equities options exchangetraded funds and debt securities the new rule also applies broadly to all access to trading on an exchange or ats provided by a brokerdealer but does not apply to nonbrokerdealers including nonbrokers that are subscribers to an ats market participants were required to be in compliance with certain requirements by july 14 2011 and in full compliance by november 30 2011 

may 6 2010related proposals 

on may 6 2010 markets dropped significantly and approximately 30 sp 500 index stocks fell at least 10 percent in a fiveminute period in response on june 10 2010 the sec approved rule changes submitted by the national securities exchanges and financial industry regulatory authority inc finra under which the exchanges would pause trading in certain individual stocks and overlying options if the price in the stock moved by a specified percentage in a fiveminute period the markets proposed these rules in consultation with finra and staff of the sec to provide for uniform marketwide standards for individual securities in the sp 500 index that experience a rapid price movement the program has since been expanded to also cover all nms stocks other than rights and warrants and overlying options the pause is intended to give the markets the opportunity to attract new trading interest establish a reasonable market price and resume trading in a fair and orderly fashion these rules are in effect on a pilot basis through july 31 2012 during the pilot period the sec staff is studying the impact of the pilot and continuing to evaluate further initiatives to address market structure issues revealed by the events of may 6 2010 such as a proposed national market system plan submitted by the stock markets and finra that would 

refine the single stock circuit breakers by incorporating a limituplimitdown type mechanism and proposed rule changes submitted by the national securities exchanges and finra that would refine the existing marketwide circuit breaker methodology for determining when to halt trading in all securities we cannot predict what future actions the sec might take with respect to the unusual market events of may 6 or the impact that any such actions may have on our business 

agency rulemaking areas 

in addition to the above identified areas the sec has been directed under doddfrank to implement many new rules both alone and in conjunction with the cftc these areas include portfolio margining and swap clearing and execution 

in 2010 the sec and cftc formed a joint advisory committee charged with developing recommendations on emerging and ongoing issues relating to both agencies the advisory committee made certain recommendations in february 2011 relating to the events of may 6 2010 regarding market structure issues that may have contributed to the volatility as well as disparate trading conventions and rules across various markets both the sec and cftc are considering rules for implementing these recommendations 

finally the sec has proposed rules including a consolidated audit trail option fee caps and banning flash orders that it has not acted upon we expect that the sec will approve rules relating to the consolidated audit trail but do not know when such rules will be implemented the exchanges and their participants are likely to incur significant costs related to the implementation of the consolidated audit trail requirements once formulated while we do not expect the sec to take action with respect to option fee caps or banning flash orders as these proposals are dated if one or both of the proposals were adopted they could cause significant changes to our market that may reduce our revenue per contract or reduce the volume of trading on our exchange 

compliance 

options industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities markets and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of selfregulatory organization sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec cbsx is a stock trading facility of cboe 

sros in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo a rigorous application and review process with the sec before beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the exchange has the capacity to carry out the purposes of the exchange act an sro must comply with the exchange act and have the ability to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit to the sec proposed changes to any of our option exchanges rules including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve disapprove or abrogate the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that the cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure fair representation of trading permit holders in the selection of cboe and c2 directors public participation in the governance of cboe and c2 and that cboe and c2 can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of cboe and c2 and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of either cboe or c2 relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out their responsibilities under the exchange act to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to the exchanges the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market that is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act cfe has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with cfe rules 

the national futures association nfa is performing most of these functions pursuant to a regulatory services agreement with cfe cfe retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace cfe also remains responsible for bringing disciplinary actions against trading privilege holders including the ability to issue fines in the case of serious rule violations in the case of financially distressed trading privilege holders cfe may take various emergency actions to protect customers other trading privilege holders and cfe cfe is also a party to cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements with other sros and is a member of the intermarket surveillance group 

doddfrank amended the core principles with which designated contract markets like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act the cftc has proposed a number of new regulations applicable to designated contract markets in order to implement the amended core principles these proposals include certain ownership and voting restrictions on stockholders like those required by the sec for securities exchanges other regulations designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and regulations relating to the trading rules that designated contract markets may implement cfe cannot predict or estimate the full extent to which the proposals may affect cfe or its operations 

regulatory responsibilities 

our options exchanges are responsible for taking steps to ensure that their trading permit holders comply with the exchanges rules and with the applicable rules of the sec the main activities that the exchanges engage in to measure compliance with these rules include 1 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect violations of exchange trading rules 2 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect possible manipulation and violations of other sec rules 3 the further investigation of matters deemed to be problematic upon review of the exception reports or matters deemed to be problematic as a result of examinations 4 the investigation of complaints about possible rule violations brought by customers members or other sros and 5 the examination of cboe and c2 trading permit holders for compliance with rules such as those related to net capital books and records market access and other matters related to the trading permit holders exchange business function as further described below each option exchange is also responsible for reviewing its trading permit holders activities related to the conduct of business directly with public customers or sales practice we have 

delegated the responsibility to conduct sales practice examinations for options to finra except that we retain responsibility for some of the sales practice examinations of trading permit holders that are not also members of finra or another us securities exchange 

section 17d of the exchange act and the related exchange act rules permit sros to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation under exchange act rule 17d1 the sec designates one sro to be the designated examining authority dea for each brokerdealer that is a member of more than one sro the dea is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the financial responsibility aspects of that brokerdealer we are the dea for many of our members 

exchange act rule 17d2 permits sros to enter into agreements commonly called rule 17d2 agreements which are approved by the sec and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those sros and relating to members those sros have in common we have entered into rule 17d2 agreements under which finra is allocated responsibility for enforcing rules related to options sales practices with respect to cboe and c2 trading permit holders and insider trading rules with respect to cbsx trading permit holders we have entered into another rule 17d2 agreement that allocates responsibility to each sro for ensuring that their allocated common members complied with rules governing expiring exercise declarations options position limits and large options position reporting and position adjustments finally we have entered into a rule 17d2 agreement that allocates certain responsibilities under regulation nms to a market participants dea 

the sec approved a national market system plan named the options regulatory surveillance authority plan orsa plan with the purpose of permitting the us securities options exchanges to act jointly in the administration operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed material information in trading in one or more of their markets through the sharing of the costs of these regulatory activities and the sharing of the regulatory information generated under the orsa plan the orsa plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and the national market system for options and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts the orsa policy committee delegated the operation of the surveillance and investigative facility contemplated by the orsa plan to cboe the exchanges have entered into a regulatory services agreement with cboe as service provider pursuant to which cboe performs certain regulatory and surveillance functions under the orsa plan and uses its automated insider trading surveillance system to perform these functions on behalf of the exchanges 

in 2011 cboe entered into regulatory services agreements with other exchanges under which cboe has agreed to provide certain regulatory services to the respective exchanges cboe is currently providing these services to one exchange and expects to begin providing services to one or more additional exchanges in 2012 

in order to ensure market integrity we extensively regulate and monitor our trading permit holders trading activities providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of marketmakers brokerdealers and institutional and retail investors 

we expend considerable time financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities exchange industry and within the regulatory regime overseen by the sec our primary regulator in order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our option exchange rules we have developed our own automated market surveillance systems to monitor market activity on our option exchanges and across us options markets 

as part of the selfregulatory process disciplinary matters other than minor matters covered by our minor rule violation plan are reviewed by our business conduct committee which includes both market participants and public representatives we are also a participant in the intermarket surveillance group isg isg is an informationsharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement in addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing the isg provides a framework for the coordination of regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities commodity futures and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses there are approximately 52 isg member organizations worldwide 

we collect certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings under the rules of each of our options exchanges as required by the sec any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for nonregulatory purposes 

opra plan cta plan and nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan 

cboe and c2 are member exchanges in opra the opra limited liability company agreement which has been approved by the sec provides that any securities exchange approved by the sec for the trading of securities options may become a member exchange of opra the agreement sets forth a system for reporting options information that is administered 

by the member exchanges through opra a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges opra is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchangelisted securities options in the us and it disseminates certain core trading information such as last sale reports and quotations we also participate in the consolidated tape association or cta the consolidated quotation plan or cq plan and the nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan which perform analogous services for the us equities markets nyse technologies formerly the securities industry automation corporation acts as the processor for opra cta and the cq plan nasdaq acts as the processor for the nasdaq unlisted trading plan

seasonality 

in the securities industry quarterly revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to seasonal variations in trading volumes competition and technological and regulatory changes generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and lower trading volumes in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality may also be impacted by general market conditions or other events that cause market volatility such as domestic and international uncertainties surrounding certain political events during 2011 24  of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 24  in the second quarter 28  in the third quarter and 24  in the fourth quarter

 item 1a risk factors 

certain statements contained in this report under various sections including business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see forwardlooking statements these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

loss of our exclusive licenses to list certain index options could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and the djia granted to us by the owners of such indexes in 2011 approximately 35  of our transaction fees were generated by our exclusivelylicensed index products the bulk of which are attributable to our sp 500 index option products which are our largest products by revenue as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although recent court decisions have allowed the trading of options on etfs based on indexes without licenses from the owners of the underlying indexes none of these decisions has overturned existing legal precedent that requires an exchange to be licensed by the owner of an underlying index before it may list options based on the index however in two pending cases international securities exchange inc or ise is seeking a judicial determination that it and by extension other options exchanges has the right to list options on the sp 500 index and the djia without licenses and therefore without regard to our exclusive licenses to list securities options on those indexes 

because these cases are still pending there remains a risk that ise may be successful in obtaining a judicial determination eliminating the right of index owners to require licenses to use their indexes for options trading in addition competing exchanges may convince the sec or seek a judicial action to limit the right of index owners to grant exclusive licenses for index options trading or to prevent exchanges from entering into such exclusive licenses if unlicensed trading of index options were permitted or if exclusive licenses for index options trading were prohibited or limited we likely would lose market share in these index options an adverse ruling in the ise litigation could also result in legal challenges to our exclusive use of our proprietary indexes for options 

there is also a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact the profitability of the licensed products in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased products that are economically similar to those for which we have exclusive licenses it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

recently we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases or the mix shifts to lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 73  76  and 74  of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason such as 

 in addition the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors including the type of customer and certain volume discounts see managements discussion and analysis  operating revenues  average transaction fee per contract if the transaction volume generated is concentrated in our products that generate lower revenues per contract in general our revenues from transactions may decrease if the amount of our trading volume decreases or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue products our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations or sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec in addition cbsx is a stock trading facility of cboe and cboe regulates cbsx in december 2011 cbsx acquired nsx a registered national securities exchange that trades stocks while nsx is not a facility of cboe in the acquisition cboe committed to support nsx in fulfilling its selfregulatory responsibilities cboe has also entered into agreements with certain other exchanges to provide regulatory services to those exchanges 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the sec has broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros pursuant to the exchange act and the secs rules and regulations under the exchange act if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement and compliance to be deficient cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of its registration as a national securities exchange any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition cboe or c2 may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

cfe is a designated contract market registered with the cftc because cfe is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc cfe is subject to substantially similar risks with respect to its regulatory and legal obligations as cboe and c2 in relation to their regulation by the sec 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its 

relationship with the cboe and c2 see regulatory environment and compliance—regulatory responsibilities 

regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in regulation by the sec or other government action including sec approval of rule filings by other sros could materially affect our markets as a result of the financial uncertainty of the past few years the doddfrank act was adopted in 2010 under which the sec and cftc among other agencies are still involved in rulemaking we cannot predict what future actions the sec or cftc might take with respect to their rulemakings under doddfrank or other matters or the impact that any such actions may have on our business changes or proposed changes in regulation may result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants trading activity on our exchanges see also —risks relating to litigation and regulation 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the seven other us options exchanges we also compete against investment banks and other entities that trade options overthecounter 

most of the equity options and options on etfs listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them as a result of these competitive developments our market share of options traded in the us fell from approximately 33 in 2007 to approximately 26  in 2011 

changes we have implemented in response to these competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

 in recent years the derivatives industry has witnessed increased consolidation among market participants including option exchanges and marketplaces consolidation and alliances among our competitors may create greater liquidity than we offer as a result the larger liquidity pools may attract orders away from us leading to reductions in trading volume and decreased revenues in addition consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and we and our competitors have adjusted our transaction fees and fee structures accordingly including by launching a second exchange c2 these changes have resulted in significant pricing and cost pressures on us it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets 

in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume if any of these events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected for example we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profit margins could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees 

we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee 

the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee these fees account for a significant portion of our operating revenues  135  in 2011 the first full year during which cboe collected this fee cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchange if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

 general economic conditions affect options trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy can have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume because our management structure and overhead costs will be based on assumptions of certain levels of market activity significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in 

substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business for a description of current litigation involving among other things these matters please see legal proceedings 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we must operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and network services including those related to our electronic trading systems in a secure and reliable manner a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the functionality and reliability of our market reputation business financial condition and operating results system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulators file lawsuits against us or cease doing business with us it could also lead regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations any of these effects could harm our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other force majeure  events if our security measures are compromised or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including harm to reputation and litigation caused by any breaches in security or system failures although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures and otherwise to provide for the integrity and reliability of our systems these measures may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks 

the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general and various groups have specifically targeted the financial services industry due to its perceived role in the current economic climate at the date of this filing we have no evidence of any cases of data theft corruption of data or compromised customer data in february 2012 web sites for cboe and other exchanges were targeted with a large distributed denial of service attack while this attack lasted only a day affected only internetbased systems and had minimal impact on cboe’s overall trading activities the potential for more serious attacks in the future exists 

security breaches may have significant costs in terms of cash outlays business disruption revenue losses internal labor overhead and other expenses both as a standard practice and in light of recent attacks in the financial industry we continue to employ resources to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business the failure to retain certain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our compliance and technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems and compliance personnel could result in systems errors or regulatory infractions consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

in recent years we have launched a new options exchange and experienced significant increased volume on our futures exchange we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continually improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures and we will need to continue to expand train and manage our technology workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology accounting finance marketing and sales functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including banking and clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms processors of market information such as the consolidated tape association and opra and various vendors of communications and networking products and services we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect the market price of our unrestricted common stock 

we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

risks relating to litigation and regulation 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be 

covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to stop using developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop using developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for a discussion of patent litigation involving us please see legal proceedings 

legislative or regulatory changes particularly in response to adverse financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in recent years the securities trading industry and in particular the securities markets have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation while certain of its requirements have been implemented many of the provisions in doddfrank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs it is also possible that there will be additional legislative changes and changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate our businesses including in response to the bankruptcy of mf global although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us and other proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see business—regulatory environment and compliance 

we and our market participants operate in a highly regulated industry congress the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets legislative and regulatory changes by congress the sec or other regulatory authorities could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities there may be a conflict of interest between our regulatory responsibilities and the interests of some of our market participants any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

as the parent company for sros we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with sec cftc and our own rules our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our subsidiaries registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes the sec review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec refuses to approve a proposed rule change or delays its approval this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business decisions 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as 

certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may not approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products in addition the cftc may stay or disapprove cfe rule changes that are submitted to the cftc 

misconduct by our customers or others could harm us 

although we perform significant selfregulatory functions we run the risk that our trading permit holders other persons who use our markets or our employees will engage in fraud or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases in addition misconduct by or failures of participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges which could reduce revenues 

changes in the tax structure affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

at the federal level there is a proposal that calls for repeal of the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income in addition federal and state legislation has been introduced that would impose a new tax on securities futures and swap transactions including exchangetraded options if either the proposed repeal of the 6040 rule or a transaction tax were to become law the resulting additional taxes could have a negative impact on the options industry and us by making options transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading in options in addition other states are attempting to increase their tax revenues by asserting that they have nexus over certain companies if another state were to successfully assert nexus against us we may experience a higher marginal tax rate 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings will depend entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for us that a stockholder might consider favorable these include provisions 

 in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

 furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

in addition delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements see risk factors and forwardlooking statements above 

overview 

the primary business of the company is the operation of markets for the trading of listed options contracts on three broad product categories 1 the stocks of individual corporations equity options 2 various market indexes index options and 3 exchangetraded funds options on etfs and exchangetraded notes options on etns we also offer futures and options on futures products through a futures exchange the company owns and operates three standalone exchanges but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment cboe is our primary market and offers trading for listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single market is known as our hybrid trading model c2 launched in october 2010 is our allelectronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options but with a different market model and fee schedule than cboe finally cfe our allelectronic futures exchange offers futures and options on futures on the cboe volatility index the vix index as well as on other products all of our exchanges operate on our proprietary technology platform known as cboe direct  

restructuring transaction 

on june 18 2010 cboe converted from a nonstock corporation owned by its members into a stock corporation that is a whollyowned subsidiary of cboe holdings 

  

in the consolidated statements of income of cboe holdings for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 net income per share allocated to common stockholders is calculated by dividing historical net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares as if the restructuring transaction were consummated at the beginning of the period 

components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fee revenue transaction fee revenue is a function of three variables 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume and 3 transaction mix between contract type because trading fees are assessed on a per contract basis exchange fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are primarily influenced by factors outside its control including price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis transaction fee revenue accounted for 734  756  and 738  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2011  2010 and 2009 respectively the main option categories traded are equities indexes and etfs the equity options category reflects trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies the index options category reflects trading in index options contracts on market indexes and on the interest rates of us treasury securities etf options are baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index but which trade like individual stocks 

the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the growth in the use of options represents a longterm trend that will continue in the future furthermore we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the overthecounter market to exchanges 

while there is no certainty we expect that the industrywide and companyspecific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes therefore if these same factors continue to exist we may experience similar changes in contract trading volume however additional factors may arise that could offset future increases in contract trading volume or result in a decline in contract trading volume such as new or existing competition or other events accordingly recent contract trading volume history may not be an indicator of future contract trading volume 

access fees 

on july 1 2010 the company began charging monthly fees to trading permit holders under a new trading access program the trading access program could be impacted by seasonality and market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

prior to july 1 2010 access fees represented fees assessed to temporary members and interim trading permit holders for the right to trade at cboe and dues charged to members the fees assessed temporary members and interim trading permit holders were based on average lease rates and the number of temporary access points and interim trading permits 

in 2009 access fees revenue primarily resulted from the recognition of temporary member access fees collected in 2007 and 2008 that were deferred until the final nonappealable resolution of the delaware action pursuant to the settlement agreement 

access fees accounted for 135  95  and 106  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2011  2010 and 2009 respectively 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers trading floor space technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and the companys market data services opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges and is authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data we are members of a management committee with other member exchanges that administer the opra limited liability agreement revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the relative number of trades executed by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter opra is not consolidated with the company a trade consists of a single transaction but may consist of several contracts each member exchanges share of market data revenue generated by opra is calculated on a per trade basis and is not based on the underlying number of contracts 

the company also derives revenue from the direct sale of a wide range of current and historical market data 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as self regulatory organizations under the exchange act beginning on march 1 2009 cboe began charging the options regulatory fee under which fees are based on the number of customer contracts executed by each firm this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holder declines and rates are not increased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease 

the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions some of which are included in this revenue category and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses mainly in employee costs 

other revenue 

the following subcategories are the primary sources of revenue within other revenue 

 35 

components of operating expenses

employee costs 

employee costs are our most significant expense and include employee wages stockbased compensation incentive compensation benefits and employer taxes salaries and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock grants stockbased compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software

data processing expense consists primarily of costs for network connections to our electronic trading platforms and market data customers 

outside services 

outside services consist primarily of consulting services which include the supplementation of staff for activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance and legal and accounting services 

royalty fees 

royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid on proprietary products based on current volume levels the company has licenses with the owners of the sp 500 and sp 100 indexes the djia the nasdaq 100 and the russell indexes 

trading volume incentives 

trading volume incentives consist of market linkage expenses incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges if a competing exchange quotes a better price we route the customers order to that exchange and pay certain of the associated costs regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our exchanges the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers trading volume incentives vary based on the volume of contracts linked to other exchanges and fees charged by other exchanges 

travel and promotional expenses 

travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising costs for special events sponsorship of industry conferences options education seminars and travel for company staff 

facilities costs 

facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent maintenance utilities real estate taxes and telecommunications costs for the company 

other expenses 

other expenses represent costs we incur on other expenses necessary to support our operations but are not included in the above categories 

other incomeexpense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating and are classified as other incomeexpense these activities primarily include investing of excess cash financing activities and investments in other business ventures 

 36 

corporate bonds our highest priority in making investment decisions is to assure the preservation of principal and secondarily to retain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements and maximize yield within the specified quality and maturity restrictions 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty the company bases its estimates on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

transaction fees revenue is considered earned upon the execution of the trade recognized on a tradedate basis and presented net of applicable volume discounts in the event liquidity providers prepay for transaction fees revenue is recognized based on the attainment of volume thresholds resulting in the amortization of the prepayment over the calendar year access fee revenue is recognized during the period the service is provided and assurance of collectability is provided exchange services and other fees revenue is recognized during the period the service is provided market data fees from opra are allocated based upon the share of total options transactions cleared for each of the opra members and is received quarterly revenue from our market data services are recognized in the period the data is provided regulatory fees are primarily assessed based upon customer contracts cleared by trading permit holders and are recognized on a tradedate basis 

software development 

the company accounts for software development costs under asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  asc 350 we expense software development costs as incurred during the preliminary project stage while capitalizing costs incurred during the application development stage which includes design coding installation and testing activities 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  asc 740 and arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the company files tax returns for federal state and local income tax purposes a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 

if the company considers that a tax position is morelikelythannot of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position it recognizes the tax benefit the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information these assessments can be complex and the company often obtains assistance from external advisors to the extent that the companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months interest and penalties if any are recorded within the provision for income taxes in 

the companys consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board released an update for accounting standard concept 220 comprehensive income asc 220 asc 220 is intended to improve the overall quality of financial reporting by increasing the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income “oci” and additionally align the presentation of oci in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap with those prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs an entity now has the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements regardless of its approach the entity is expected to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income the amendments are effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 the company has adopted the asc 220 and has included the statement of other comprehensive income as a separate statement following the statement of income 

year ended december 31 2011  compared to the year ended december 31 2010   

overview 

the following summarizes changes in financial performance for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 2010 



 significant events in 2011 

the company and the options industry experienced higher trading volumes during 2011 we believe the higher volume was achieved due to volatility and movements in the financial markets arising primarily out of domestic and international uncertainties surrounding certain political events such as the continued budget issues in washington dc and the economic unrest and sovereign debt issues in europe 

pursuant to an employment agreement with a senior executive the company recorded 37 million in severance expense for payments in connection with his departure from the company which is included in employee costs in the consolidated 

statement of income for the period ended december 31 2011 

the company recorded income tax expense of 42 million  to reserve for potential additional tax liabilities as a result of an advisory opinion from new york state taxing authorities issued in the third quarter which attempts to extend the states taxing power over certain electronic transactions and other fees of outofstate exchanges going back to 2007 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2011  were 5081 million  an increase of 710 million  or 162  compared with the prior year the following summarizes changes in total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 2010 



transaction fees 

transaction fees increased 130  to 3731 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  representing 734  of total operating revenues compared with 3303 million  for the prioryear period or 756  of total operating revenues this increase was largely driven by a 44  and 83  increase in the average transaction fee per contract and trading volume respectively the increase in average transaction fee per contract is impacted by the mix of contracts traded and trading volume the following summarizes transaction fees by product for 2011 compared to 2010 



trading volume 

the companys average daily trading volume adv was 483 million contracts in 2011 an increase of 83  compared with 446 million for 2010 total trading days in 2011 and 2010 were two hundred fiftytwo the company experienced volume increases of 333  and 187  in options on exchangetraded funds and index options respectively these increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity options volume of 99  the company continued to experience significant growth in futures primarily driven by futures contracts on the vix index the following summarizes changes in total trading volume and adv by product for 2011 compared to 2010 



average transaction fee per contract 

the average transaction fee per contract was 0307  in 2011 an increase of 44  compared with 0294  in 2010 average transaction fee per contract represents transaction fees divided by total contracts in general the company faces continued downward pressure on transaction fees in the markets in which we compete 

the following summarizes average transaction fee per contract by product for 2011  compared to 2010  



there are a number of factors that have contributed to the increase in our average transaction fee per contract in 2011 compared to 2010 these include 

 40 

we have and will continue to change our fees in the future in light of the competitive pressures in our industry these future fee changes may increase or decrease our average transaction fee per contract our average transaction fee may also increase or decrease based on changes in trading patterns of marketmakers and orderflow providers which are based on factors not in our control 

at december 31 2011  there were approximately one hundred cboe clearing firms two of which cleared a combined 48 of our billings collected through the occ in 2011  the next largest clearing firm accounted for approximately 5 of our billings collected through the occ no one affiliate of either of the top two clearing firms represented more than 15 of that revenue in 2011  or 2010 should a clearing firm withdraw from cboe we believe the affiliate portion of that firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2011  and 2010 our cash and cash equivalents were 1349 million  and 538 million  respectively we invest available cash in highly liquid shortterm investments such as money market funds and us treasury securities our investment policy is to preserve capital and liquidity a hypothetical three basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease annual earnings by  38000 assu ming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or decline since transactions on our exchanges are not governed by longterm contracts we believe that any increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on us

industry 

our primary business is part of the large and growing global derivatives industry derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from some other underlying asset or reference value these underlying assets and reference values include individual stocks stock indexes debt instruments interest rates currencies commodities and various benchmarks related to trading and investment strategies in recent years derivatives have also been developed on economic indicators and artificial assets such as pollution rights the global derivatives industry includes both exchanges and a large overthecounter market the most common types of derivatives are options futures and swap contracts these products allow for various types of risk to be isolated and transferred 

exchangetraded options and futures 

options represent a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying security or index at a specific price for a specific period of time options provide investors a means for hedging speculation and income generation while at the same time providing leverage with respect to the underlying asset options are traded privately between two parties know as overthecounter options as well as traded on us securities exchanges the vast majority of derivatives traded on us securities exchanges are options on individual equities market indexes and etfs overthecounter options that are traded include options on individual equities etfs and indexes including options on the sp 500 index 

the buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment an option on a futures contract is a right but not an obligation to buy or sell a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date 

trading 

until 2000 trading in options products on us options exchanges traditionally occurred primarily on physical trading floors in areas called pits through an auction process known as open outcry which refers to facetoface trading over the past decade electronic access has allowed exchange participants including those at cboe to provide electronic bids and offers without being physically present on the trading floor now all of the us options exchanges either exclusively or in combination with open outcry trading provide electronic trading platforms that allow participants to submit bids offers and orders directly into the exchanges trading system as a result many liquidity providers now operate remotely away from the physical trading floors and the majority of options trading volume is executed electronically 

in the listed options market there are currently options contracts covering approximately 3300 underlying stocks etfs and indexes the presence of dedicated liquidity providers including both specialists and marketmakers is a key feature of the options markets specialists and marketmakers provide continuous bids and offers for substantially all listed option series in return for these 

commitments specialists and marketmakers receive margin exemptions as well as other incentives such as participation rights and fee incentives 

trends 

consolidation 

competitive pressures and the advantages of large scale operations have provided the strategic rationale for consolidation among exchanges the migration to stockholder structures and forprofit business models has facilitated a number of such mergers and acquisitions for example nyse euronext now owns both nyse arca and nyse amex deutsche borse has acquired the international securities exchange and nasdaq omx owns both the philadelphia stock exchange phlx and nasdaq options market nom in february 2011 nyse euronext and deutsche borse announced they had agreed to combine their business and the tmx group inc parent of the boston options exchange box announced their intention to merge with the london stock exchange group plc this trend has been occurring on a global scale and can be expected to continue 

makertaker pricing structure 

several options exchanges including c2 utilize a different pricing model than cboe in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee dependent on origin type and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace may receive a rebate for doing so dependent on origin type this kind of fee schedule known as makertaker is attractive to participants who regularly provide liquidity but not necessarily to firms representing customer orders as those orders are disproportionately takers of liquidity 

high frequency trading 

high frequency trading refers to the practice of entering buy and sell orders in rapid succession often as many as thousands of orders per second the strategies pursued by high frequency traders depend on sophisticated algorithms to spot trends before others can react to them and to exploit minor fluctuations in securities prices its practitioners are professional traders who typically use highspeed computers colocated at exchanges with direct connections to exchange order routing systems to reduce latency high frequency trading has driven up trading volume on equity exchanges and is estimated to account for from 50 to 70 of stock trading it currently plays a small but growing role in options markets and has led many exchanges to create a new category of market participant known as professional customer which enables those exchanges to treat these orders differently than other customer orders 

the sec is currently seeking comments on various practices related to high frequency trading to determine if these practices disadvantage longterm investors the practices the sec are reviewing include colocation and market access access to trading directly on an exchange or alternative trading system including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a global leader and innovator in the options industry we believe we are well positioned to further enhance our leadership position through several key competitive strengths 

• leading brand reputation and market position as the worlds first options exchange cboes leadership role in options trading is recognized worldwide we are one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the us based on both contract volume and notional value our opinions and positions on industry issues are sought by 7 

regulators elected officials industry and finance leaders and policy experts worldwide our website which consists of over 70000 pages is the most extensive in the industry—forbes magazine has named it a best of the web successively since the inception of the award in 2001 

• innovation and product development in addition to being the original marketplace for standardized exchangetraded options we created the worlds first index options and have been the source of many other innovations with respect to products systems and market structure in the options industry • innovation— we work closely and collaboratively with market participants to introduce new products and services to meet the evolving needs of the derivatives industry we have introduced innovative products such as index options longterm equity anticipation securities leaps flex options volatility options and most recently options on the sp 500 dividend index our products such as the cboe sp 500 buywrite index the cboe sp 500 putwrite index futures and options on vix and the cboe sp 500 implied correlation index have received industry awards for innovation • exclusive licenses— we have the exclusive right to list securities options based on the sp 500 the sp 100 and the djia indexes many of our products based on these exclusive licenses are among the most actively traded products on cboe and in the industry • proprietary products— we have created our own proprietary indexes and index methodologies including vix which provide benchmarks for options users serve as the basis for exclusive products and provide us with licensing revenue • hybrid trading model our hybrid trading model on cboe integrates open outcry and electronic trading into a single market we believe that this innovative approach offers our users more choices a diverse pool of liquidity and the ability to execute complex strategies that may not be available on purely screenbased trading systems • leading proprietary technology platform we own operate and maintain our core trading and information technology and systems and we continue to commit substantial resources towards ongoing development and implementation of these capabilities market participants rely on our technology and infrastructure which provides a high level of availability and reliability we believe the cboe direct trading platform is among the most advanced trading platforms in the world it can simultaneously support both screen and floorbased trading for multiple trading models multiple products and multiple matching algorithms the technology underlying cboe direct is designed for extremely high performance it is built on open standards providing platform independence and is designed to be scalable for both capacity and throughput • liquidity we support the options trading activities of trading permit holders ie individuals or firms that hold trading permits tph organizations we believe that this diverse pool of liquidity providers in combination with our broad range of products hybrid trading model and the cboe direct trading platform offers our users the liquid markets they require to effectively execute their trading strategies • experienced management team our management team has extensive experience in the options industry william j brodsky our chairman and chief executive officer and edward j joyce our president and chief operating officer each has over 35 years of experience with exchange management and derivative products the remaining seven members of the senior management team have an average of over 25 years of experience in the options industry we believe that our management team has demonstrated an ability to grow our business through continued product 8 

and technological innovations and has evidenced the ability to respond to changing industry dynamics through ongoing adaptation of our market model 

growth strategy 

trading in derivative products has expanded at a rapid pace over the past several years as a result of a number of factors including technological advances that have increased investor access declining costs to users globalization and greater understanding of the products by increasingly sophisticated market participants the company is well positioned to leverage its competitive strengths to take advantage of these trends 

we intend to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies 

• continue to enhance our market model and trading platform we recognize that the opportunity to participate in the growth of the derivative markets will be driven in great part by the trading functionality and systems capabilities that an exchange offers to market participants we believe that our hybrid trading model offers flexibility to market participants while the cboe direct trading platform offers stateoftheart functionality speed performance capacity and reliability we intend to use our strong inhouse development capabilities and continued investment to further augment the functionality and capacity of our trading systems in addition on october 29 2010 we launched c2 a second allelectronic options market that currently trades substantially all of the industrys leading multilisted products c2 operates under a separate exchange license with its own board of directors rules connectivity systems architecture and access structure • develop innovative products we intend to continue to build on our reputation as an industry innovator through the development of new and innovative products we intend to use licensed products and proprietary intellectual property to create exclusive products that meet the needs of the derivatives industry and enhance our brand we anticipate that our new and innovative products will help drive trading volumes by attracting new customers to our exchanges and expanding the array of products available to existing customers in addition we believe our continuing product innovations will generate increased use of other cboe products in the same way that vix and the cboe sp 500 buywrite index have generated additional trading activity in spx in 2011 we plan to list on c2 an electronicallytraded version of our flagship sp 500 index option spx which we are calling spxpm we submitted a rule filing to the sec on february 28 2011 and plan to list spxpm upon sec approval under the proposed rule change spxpm will be identical in structure to cboes traditional spx index option product except it will have pm settlement we intend to broaden our customer reach by providing this elctronic pm settled version of our most actively traded index product our spx index option trades exclusively on cboe and primarily trades in open outcry • attract overthecounter market participants as a result of the 2008 financial crisis overthecounter market participants have been under pressure from regulators to move much of their trading from the overthecounter market to a centrally traded centrally cleared environment we seek to attract participants from the overthecounter market and are developing strategies that target this market segment for example cflex our internetbased electronic system for trading flex options allows participants to customize key contract terms including strike price exercise style and expiration dates of up to fifteen years with the administrative ease and clearing guarantees of standardized listed options in addition we eliminated blackout dates for flex options in 2009 and implemented two pilot programs that eliminated the minimum size requirement for flex options and the restriction on pm settlement for index options traded in flex 9 

• expand service offerings we believe there are significant opportunities to derive revenue from new and expanded service offerings for example our subsidiary market data express llc mdx sells historical options data valueadded proprietary information and a datafeed of certain sp and cboe index values to market data users in 2011 mdx increased its service offerings with cboe streaming market csm csm is a highavailability low latency streaming data feed with data similar to market data from opra but also includes complex quotes and trades customer information and contingent information in addition through a set of arrangements with sp we permit sp to license the companys proprietary indexes and index methodologies for certain purposes to securities firms and other exchanges the company and sp have agreed that sp may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction • pursue select strategic opportunities technology globalization and competition have led to the emergence of a number of diverse worldclass exchanges offering large pools of liquidity across multiple asset classes and product types at the same time new technologies and the internet have also created a fertile testing ground for new risk management products and market models we expect these trends to continue and we intend to evaluate consolidation and alliance opportunities that we believe will enhance stockholder value products 

our exchanges provide a marketplace for the trading of options contracts that meet criteria established in rules of the respective exchange the options contracts listed for trading include options on individual equities options on various market indexes as well as options on etfs and etns in addition we provide marketplaces for trading futures contracts and cash equities through cfe and cboe stock exchange llc cbsx cbsx is not a consolidated subsidiary of the company

cboe and c2 provide a reliable orderly liquid and efficient marketplace for the trading of options cboe operates a quotedriven auction market that employs a combination of specialists marketmakers floor brokers and electronic access permit firms order flow providers while c2 employs marketmakers and electronic access permit firms order flow providers only at cboe dpms see definition below are specialists that are charged with maintaining fair orderly and continuous markets in specific option classes either from the trading floor or remotely in certain 

heavily traded classes cboe assigns multiple remoteonly specialists edpms to enhance cboes competitive position in that product both dpms and edpms trade for their own accounts and are not permitted to act as agent on behalf of customers although they may be affiliated with large financial companies that also operate agency businesses marketmakers operating from remote locations or inperson on the trading floor supplement the liquidity provided by the specialists by quoting both bids and offers for their own accounts in their assigned classes floor brokers act as agents on the trading floor to facilitate primarily large or complicated orders that customers choose not to direct to the electronic system 

cboe and c2 offer different but complementary market models offering customers and participants a broad range of choices

we operate three separate selfregulatory exchanges cboe c2 and cfe we are also affiliated with and provide the trading engine for cbsx purchasing a monthly marketmaker trading permit cboe c2 electronic access permit cboe c2 or floor broker trading permit cboe for the respective exchange conveys trading permit holder status on the respective exchange to the permit holder for cboe additional tier appointments are required to act as a marketmaker in trade spx options or as a marketmaker or floor broker in vix options we expect to begin trading spxpm on c2 an electronic version of our sp 500 option product with pm settlement and similar to cboe an additional tier appointment will be required for marketmakers 

in general trading permit holders are brokerdealers of large banks proprietary trading firms brokerages and investment houses and clearing firms as well as individual traders trading on our open outcry trading floor is conducted exclusively by trading permit holders in chicago trading permit holders can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other permit holders or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms 

trading permit holder status enables a marketmaker to submit electronic quotes into the trade engine on cboe or c2 or make markets in open outcry on cboe trading permit holder status allows floor brokers on cboe to conduct business on the exchange floor or enter orders into the trade engine trading permit holder status for electronic access permits allows the holder to enter electronic orders into the trade engine a brokerdealer can apply for and hold a trading permit at cboe c2 or both—depending on the products intended to be traded rights and privileges of trading permits are exchangespecific 

trading permits 

• marketmaker trading permit holders cboe c2 —the marketmaker trading permit entitles the holder to act as a marketmaker including a marketmaker trading remotely dpm edpm or lmm on the respective exchange if applicable on such exchange this permit provides an appointment credit of 10 which is a measure of how many classes the trading permit holder can quote a quoting and order entry bandwidth allowance up to three logins trading floor access and trading permit holder status trading all classes listed on cboe requires a minimum of thirtythree permits the quoting bandwidth allowance for a marketmaker trading permit is equivalent to a maximum of 312 million quotes over the course of a trading day to the extent a marketmaker is able to submit electronic quotes in a hybrid 30 class such as a lmm that streams quotes in the class or a marketmaker or lmm that streams quotes in a series of a hybrid 30 class that trades on the hybrid trading system the marketmaker receives the quoting bandwidth allowance to quote in and only in that class 

• electronic access permit eap cboe c2 —the eap entitles the holder to electronic access to the exchange holders must be brokerdealers registered with the exchange in one or more of the following capacities a clearing trading permit holder b trading permit holder organization approved to transact business with the public c proprietary trading permit holder and d order service firm this cboe eap permit does not provide access to the trading floor a proprietary trading permit holder is a trading permit holder with electronic access to the exchanges to submit proprietary orders that are not marketmaker orders ie that are not marketmaker orders for the proprietary trading permit holders own account or an affiliated marketmaker account the eap provides an order entry bandwidth allowance up to three logins and trading permit holder status • floor broker trading permit cboe —the floor broker trading permit entitles the holder to act as a floor broker this permit provides an order entry bandwidth allowance up to three logins trading floor access and trading permit holder status including access to cbsx a floor broker is a trading permit holder who can act as a broker for other trading permit holders or registered brokerdealers as an agent on the floor of the exchange tier appointments 

in order for a marketmaker trading permit to be used to act as a marketmaker in either spx or vix the trading permit holder must obtain a tier appointment for the respective option class each tier appointment is classspecific we expect that spxpm will have a similar tier appointment for marketmakers to trade it on c2 pending sec approval as tier appointments are exchangespecific 

applicants for trading permit holder status 

applicants for trading permit holder status must have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of trading permit holder status all trading permit holders must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them additionally they must comply with the provisions of the exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the sec 

our regulatory services division is the investigative arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules trading permit holders who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

hybrid trading model 

most options are traded on cboe both electronically and in open outcry using its hybrid trading model both c2 and cfe are allelectronic exchanges 

we developed the first hybrid trading model in which aspects of both open outcry and electronic trading are integrated to function as a single market this trading model is supported by stateoftheart technology including the cboe direct trading platform since we began operating our hybrid trading model in 2003 a significant portion of the volume in our products has migrated to electronic execution 

the hybrid trading model enables cboe marketmakers to employ their own individual pricing models and to stream their own individual quotes and orders into the cboe trading engine cboe marketmakers present on the trading floor are able to both stream their quotes into cboes central trading engine and to participate in open outcry transactions effected in their trading crowd our hybrid trading model allows cboe to offer both electronic and open outcry trading models simultaneously without sacrificing the benefits each brings 

at the core of the hybrid trading model are the matching algorithms which is the means by which trades are executed and allocated to market participants cboes technology and rules provide for a variety of different algorithms for matching buyers and sellers cboe has the ability to apply different matching algorithms to different products and currently has two different algorithms in operation for various products each matching algorithm is designed to meet the needs of a particular market segment the setting of the matching algorithm affects the share of each trade that a market participant receives and is central to the opportunity and profit potential of marketmakers and other liquidity providers 

our hybrid trading system calculates the national best bid and offer nbbo and orders are not executed at a price inferior to the displayed nbbo except pursuant to limited exceptions provided in cboes rules the system monitors all other option marketplaces and it has the capability to route orders to other marketplaces for execution if a better price exists elsewhere this linkage model is based on the regulation nms national market system intermarket linkage structure that exists for us equity trading the structure requires price protection of the exchanges best displayed bids and offers bbos when they are at the nbbo and utilizes intermarket sweep orders isos to trade multiple prices at multiple exchanges nearly simultaneously undisplayed bids and offers and bids and offers at price that are inferior to an exchanges bbo do not receive protection under this plan 

the hybrid trading system also supports offfloor participants including remote market making offfloor dpms and edpms currently edpms make markets in approximately 500 classes 

our market model continues to evolve and expand as we innovate and adapt to changes in the marketplace details on our technological capabilities as well as key systems offerings available to customers is described in technology 

competition 

cboe is the largest options exchange in the us based on both total contract volume and notional value of contracts traded our market share for all options traded on us exchanges over the past five years has ranged from 286 to 333 for 2010 our market share was 286 

the us options industry is extremely competitive we compete with a number of registered national securities exchanges and may compete with other exchanges or other trading venues in the future the seven other us options exchanges that are our primary direct competitors are bats options box ise nyse arca nyse amex nasdaq omx phlx and nom 

competition among options exchanges has intensified since cboe was created in 1973 and we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the seven other us options exchanges we also compete against futures exchanges trading similar products and other financial institutions that write overthecounter derivatives there are three futures exchanges that offer competing products 

most equity options and options on etfs listed and traded on cboe and c2 are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in other options exchanges that compete with us which may give those firms an added incentive to direct orders to the exchanges in which they have ownership in addition several options exchanges utilize a pricing model in which orders that take liquidity from the marketplace are charged a transaction fee dependent on origin type and orders that provide liquidity to the marketplace may receive a rebate for doing so dependent on origin type this type of fee schedule known as makertaker is attractive to participants who regularly provide liquidity but not necessarily to firms representing customer orders as those orders are disproportionately takers of liquidity 

our competitive challenge is to convince brokerdealers to route options orders to cboe or c2 rather than to our competitors and to convince liquidity providers to concentrate their market making activity on our exchanges this is particularly true with respect to options on individual equity securities and etfs which tend to be traded on multiple exchanges we compete through a variety of methods including 

• launching c2 in october 2010 which employs the makertaker fee schedule as a complement to cboe which employs the traditional market model where transaction fees are paid primarily by marketmakers and firms trading for their proprietary accounts and nonprofessional customers pay little or no transaction fees c2 is also allelectronic as compared to cboes hybrid trading model • offering market participants an efficient transparent and liquid marketplace for trading options both through traditional open outcry methods and through our electronic platform cboe direct  • providing advanced technology that offers broad functionality high bandwidth fast execution ease of use scalability reliability and security • offering participants access to a broad array of products and services including proprietary products • offering customers execution at the national best bid and offer with the additional potential for price improvement 16 

• offering customers liquidity beyond the size posted on the screens • offering a costeffective trading venue to order flow providers • facilitating payment for order flow through the administration of marketing fees • offering marketmakers and specialists costeffective access to customer order flow including potential participation rights that guarantee them a portion of certain trades provided they have met certain obligations and • providing brokers and their customers with a complete source of information on options as well as extensive options education technology 

our technology supports trading on multiple exchanges cboe c2 cfe cbsx and onechicago our systems can simultaneously support multiple trading models and multiple matching algorithms per exchange for example different products could trade simultaneously using open outcry screen based or a hybrid model within these trading models different products can be traded using different matching algorithms cboe direct also supports trading options on futures we have licensed our platform for use by cbsx and onechicago 

trading platform 

cboe direct the central platform for our hybrid trading system was launched in 2003 the cboe direct platform integrates the cboe direct trading engine with the routing display systems and broker handling systems that support the trading floor it provides features of screenbased and floorbased trading in what we believe is a best of both worlds market model 

cboe uses a quotedriven market model where liquidity providers have quoting obligations the cboe direct trade engine includes the match engine the order book and the quote processor cboe direct enables the users to post quotes with size and expedite order execution cboe direct accepts streaming quotes from marketmakers dpms edpms and lmms automatically executes marketable orders and opens the book to noncustomers 

cboe direct functionality includes numerous allocation algorithms a complex order book including complex orders with a stock component preferenced orders several auction mechanisms quote lock quote risk monitor and user input monitor the various allocation algorithms are configurable by product 

cboe directs underlying technology is a java application with an infrastructure designed for high performance and is designed to be scalable for capacity and throughput cboes trading platform is capable of accommodating significantly more than the over 3000 options classes and over 300000 options series currently trading on it in addition to simple orders our systems support trading spreads and other complex orders as well as options that expire weekly in 2010 cboe transmitted to the options price reporting authority opra peaks of over 500000 quotes per second and cboe accepts from its users and disseminates to opra more quotes than any other options exchange 

cboe directs design allows for a quick introduction of different types of derivative and securities products including options futures options on futures and stock products in addition our system facilitates different trading models allowing us to provide both a floorbased model and a screenbased model 

cboe direct provides application programming interfaces or apis to facilitate both quote and order entry as well as auction processing these include a proprietary api called cboe market interface cmi and the industrystandard financial information exchange fix 

order routing trade match ticker plant and market data 

the order routing system allows trading permit holders to use fix or cmi 

the trade match system uses cboe direct technology it sends matched trades to the options clearing corporation occ which then settles and clears the trades the trade match system provides matched trade information to clearing firms via cboe direct technology brokers have access to their trades and related account information via a webbased interface or through an api 

the ticker plant xtp takes in market data feeds from ctscqs opra nasdaq the cme group inc cme and other sources and disseminates the data internally to other systems on a publishsubscribe basis xtps most recent processing peak was 12 million messages per second or mps inbound from the opra with over 6 billion messages per day 

the system disseminates options market data to opra and to trading permit holders via fix cmi and csm csm is a new high speed multicast feed for distribution of current market data the system also uses ticker express to provide fast accurate market data to trading permit holders 

cfe disseminates futures market data via the cboe financial network cfn our futures market data network 

our fully integrated realtime system tracks electronic trading for help desk troubleshooting and regulatory analysis we have invested in an extensive data warehouse with terabytes of historical trading data that provides fast and easy access to data for analysis 

disaster recovery 

with two options exchanges we have multiple data center locations running on the same technology platform we use a remote data center to provide a point of redundancy for our cboe and cfe exchanges our remote facility fully replicates our primary cboe data center and is designed to ensure the operation of our platforms functionality in the face of external threats unforeseen disasters or internal failures in the event of an emergency cboe trading permit holders connecting to the cboe trading platform can route to the backup facility our primary data center continuously collects and saves all trade information and periodically transmits it to the backup facility for that reason we expect that our disaster recovery system would have current and in most cases realtime information in the event of a platform outage in the event that we were required to complete a changeover to a backup disaster facility we anticipate that our platform would experience minimal downtime 

clearing system 

the occ acts as the issuer counterparty and guarantor for all options contracts traded on our options exchanges and other us securities exchanges upon execution of an option trade we transmit to occ a record of all trading activity for clearing and settlement purposes occ fulfills these same functions for futures products traded on the cfe 

market data 

our markets generate valuable information regarding the prices of our products and the trading activity in those markets market data relating to price and size of market quotations and the price and size of trades is collected and consolidated by opra opra disseminates the information to vendors who redistribute the data to brokers investors and other persons or entities that use our markets or that monitor general economic conditions such as financial information providers brokerdealers banks futures commission merchants public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies hedge funds commodity pools individual investors and other financial services organizations after costs are deducted the fees collected are distributed among exchange 

participants based on their cleared transactions pursuant to the opra plan as of december 2010 our market data was displayed on approximately 176000 terminals worldwide see regulatory environment and compliance for further information on opra 

through our subsidiary mdx we are expanding our market data offerings mdx is a market data vendor providing information on specialized indexes time and sales information and specialized reports of historical market data

regulatory environment and compliance 

recent developments 

laws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed including in response to adverse financial conditions new products competition or at the request of market participants the following is a summary of the recent regulatory developments that may impact our business 

the penny pilot program 

cboe c2 and the other options exchanges currently participate in the penny pilot program which began in 2007 options classes traded in this program generally are quoted in penny and nickel increments as opposed to the five and ten cent increments allowed under existing rules the sec has expressed the view that quoting in pennies benefits investors in two ways 1 penny increments allow for a narrower bidask spread and 2 the pricing pressure reduces the role of payment for order flow in options the sec recently extended this program through the end of 2011 currently 365 option classes are participating in the penny pilot program and they are among the most activelytraded option classes representing approximately 76 of the national options volume 

portfolio margining 

the portfolio margining rules are intended to align the amount of margin capital required to be held in a customer account with the risk of the portfolio as a whole instead of with the risk of each instrument in the portfolio portfolio margining can significantly reduce margin requirements and make trading more efficient by freeing up margin capital for other purposes cboe and financial industry regulatory authority finra have approved 25 brokerdealers to offer portfolio margining as of december 31 2010 

the doddfrank act addressed one of the major obstacles to broader use of portfolio margining currently us bankruptcy laws treat the customer property of a brokerdealer differently than that of a futures commission merchant the doddfrank act amended several provisions in the securities investor protection act of 1970 to provide protection to futures positions held in a portfolio margin account at a brokerdealer 

the doddfrank act also added general provisions to the securities exchange act of 1934 and the commodity exchange act to permit securities and futures positions in a single portfolio margin account and directs the sec and cftc to consult and adopt specific rules that permit securities and broadbased stock index futures positions to exist in a single customer portfolio margin account as of february 28 2011 the agencies have not proposed rules to implement these provisions of doddfrank 

short sale restrictions 

on february 24 2010 the sec voted 32 to adopt a new alternative uptick rule rule 201 under regulation sho the alternative uptick rule imposes restrictions on short selling only when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day at that point short selling would be permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid rule 201 includes the following features 

• short salerelated circuit breaker the circuit breaker would be triggered for a security any day in which the price declines by 10 percent or more from the prior days closing price • duration of price test restriction once the circuit breaker has been triggered the alternative uptick rule would apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day • securities covered by price test restriction the rule generally applies to all equity securities that are listed on a national securities exchange whether traded on an exchange or in the overthecounter market and • implementation the rule requires trading centers to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a prohibited short sale the new rule became effective may 10 2010 and market participants had until february 28 2011 to comply with the requirements the alternative uptick rule does not contain exceptions for options marketmakers that may enter short sales in underlying securities in connection with bona fide option market making and hedging activities consequently the new rule could affect the ability of options marketmakers to conduct their business on the cboe and elsewhere 

we cannot predict what further action if any the sec may take with respect to short selling or what effect any sec action might have on the options exchange business including our business 

flash orders 

on september 18 2009 the sec proposed a rule change that would ban the use of flash orders in stock and options markets the proposed ban does not distinguish between electronic flashes and flashes that may occur in open outcry trading orders that get flashed on exchanges are orders that are marketable but cannot be executed on the receiving exchange at that exchanges disseminated price because another exchange is displaying a better price flashing an order gives participants on the receiving exchange an opportunity to stepup and match or improve the better price available on another exchange before a linkage order is routed to such other exchange because cboe currently absorbs the linkage and execution costs incurred at other exchanges when a linkage order is sent to such other exchanges on behalf of small retail customer orders cboes flash mechanism is popular with those customers 

cboe and many options market participants have submitted letters to the sec expressing the view that flash orders in options benefit customers by reducing costs and providing greater choice of execution venues we cannot predict what action the sec may take with respect to flash orders 

market access 

on november 3 2010 the sec approved a rule change that would require brokers or dealers with access to trading directly on an exchange or automated trading system ats including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons to implement risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the financial regulatory and other risks of this business activity given the increased speed and automation of trading on securities exchanges and atss today and the growing popularity of sponsored or direct market access arrangements where brokerdealers allow customers to trade in those markets electronically using the brokerdealers market participant identifiers the sec is concerned that the various financial and regulatory risks that arise in connection with such access may not be appropriately and effectively controlled by all brokerdealers the new rule encompasses trading in all securities on an exchange or ats including equities options exchangetraded funds and debt securities the new rule also applies broadly to all access to trading on an exchange or ats provided by a brokerdealer it would not apply to nonbrokerdealers including nonbrokers that are subscribers of an ats the new rule became effective january 14 2011 and market participants have until july 14 2011 to comply with the requirements 

equity market structure concept release 

on january 21 2010 the sec published a concept release applicable to the equity markets that requests comments on various matters related to the structure of equity markets including high frequency trading and markets that do not publicly display price quotations often referred to as dark pools the sec is assessing whether the current market structure serves the interests of longterm investors and whether it promotes capital formation included in the discussion of high frequency trading is a discussion of colocation practice whereby trading firms seek to house computer servers in close physical proximity to exchange trading systems to reduce latency cboe has market participants that colocate servers at cboe while the sec assessment is directed at equity markets it is possible that colocation practices and other aspects of high frequency trading in the listed options market may be affected as a result of any sec rule making that occurs as a result of the concept release and sec assessment we cannot predict what if any actions the sec may take regarding the topics covered in this concept release 

fee caps 

on april 14 2010 the sec proposed rule amendments regarding a prohibiting unfairly discriminatory terms that inhibit efficient access to quotations in a listed option on exchanges and b placing a 030 per contract limit on the total access fees that an exchange may charge for the execution of an order against a quotation that is the best bid or best offer of such exchange in a listed option the sec indicated that these amendments are designed to extend the same measures to listed options that currently apply to transactions in exchangelisted stocks the sec estimated in its release based on december 2009 options trade data available to the sec that if the 030 fee cap were applied as proposed in the release the potential reduction in annual revenue to cboe could be approximately 239 million we do not have complete information on how the sec arrived at this figure we undertook our own review of december 2009 trade data in which we only applied the proposed fee cap to the execution of orders that traded against cboes displayed best bid or offer although the proposed rule is drafted broadly our review was based on cboes interpretation of the secs discussion in the release which largely focuses on access to displayed bids and offers and makes statements such as the proposed access feewould apply only to quotations that market participants are required to access to comply with the tradethrough rules based on this interpretation and our analysis using our december 2009 contract volume we estimated that the potential reduction to the transaction fee component of annual operating revenue of cboe could be approximately 142 million 

we note that we did not exclude transactions in singlylisted options for this analysis in order to allow a more consistent comparison with how we understand the sec to have calculated its estimate 

we cannot predict whether the sec will adopt the proposed rule amendments modified versions or at all the potential impact to our revenues however could be higher or lower depending on changes in our contract volume and product mix in future periods as well as other factors including those that are currently being considered as part of the rulemaking process for example in its release the sec asks whether the proposed fee cap should only apply to multiplylisted options we also note that in the release the sec states that it preliminarily believes that exchanges are likely to amend their fees that would not be impacted by the access fee limitation to make up for the reduction in access fee revenue thus keeping the overall level of fees paid by members and the amount of revenue received by the exchange relatively constant if the proposed rules are adopted as proposed or are adopted in a form substantially similar to that proposed and cboe is unable to make changes to its fee structure in response to the rules as adopted it would have a material adverse effect on our business result of operations and financial condition the sec has not acted on the proposal to date we are committed to vigorously challenging fee caps for listed options 

circuit breaker rule proposals 

on may 6 2010 markets dropped significantly and approximately 30 sp 500 index stocks fell at least 10 percent in a fiveminute period in response on june 10 2010 the sec approved rule changes submitted by the national securities exchanges and finra under which they would pause trading in certain individual stocks and overlaying options if the price in the stock moves 10 percent or more in a fiveminute period the markets proposed these rules in consultation with finra and staff of the sec to provide for uniform marketwide standards for individual securities in the sp 500 index that experience a rapid price movement the program has since been expanded to also cover individual securities in the russell 1000 index and a pilot list of exchange traded products and overlying options the pause is intended to give the markets the opportunity to attract new trading interest establish a reasonable market price and resume trading in a fair and orderly fashion these rules are in effect on a pilot basis through april 11 2011 the markets will use the pilot period to make appropriate adjustments to the circuit breaker as warranted based on their experience and to expand the scope to securities beyond the sp 500 including etfs as soon as practicable the sec intends to publish the proposed rules for a 10day public comment period and determine whether to approve them shortly thereafter 

during the pilot period the sec staff is studying the impact of the pilot and continuing to evaluate further initiatives to address market structure issues revealed by the events of may 6 2010 such as refining the single stock circuit breakers by incorporating a limituplimit down type mechanism 

we cannot predict what future actions the sec might take with respect to the unusual market events of may 6 or the impact that any such actions may have on our business 

compliance 

options industrycboe and c2 

federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities markets and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws the second tier consists of sros which are nongovernmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the sec cboe and c2 are sros each registered under section 6 of the exchange act as a national securities exchange and are subject to oversight by the sec 

sros in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be registered as a national securities exchange an exchange must successfully undergo a rigorous application and review process with the sec before beginning operations among other things the sec must determine that the exchange has the capacity to carry out the purposes of the exchange act an sro must comply with the exchange act and have the ability to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange our two options exchanges cboe and c2 as sros are registered with and subject to oversight by the sec 

in general an sro is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members the rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and among other things provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer additionally the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act 

as registered national securities exchanges virtually all facets of our cboe and c2 operations are subject to the secs oversight as prescribed by the exchange act the exchange act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities including the daytoday responsibilities for market and brokerdealer oversight we are also subject to periodic and special examinations by the sec furthermore as sros cboe and c2 are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the sec or other interested parties the sec also has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or to remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations 

as part of its regulatory oversight the sec conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges and cboe and c2 have been subject to a number of routine reviews and inspections by the sec since we began operations to the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business which may adversely affect our business 

cboe and c2 are also subject to the record keeping requirements of section 17 of the exchange act including the requirement pursuant to section 17b of the exchange act to make certain records available to the sec for examination 

section 19 of the exchange act also provides that we must submit proposed changes to any of our option exchanges rules policies and practices including revisions of their certificates of incorporation and bylaws the sec will typically publish the proposal for public comment following which the sec may approve disapprove or abrogate the proposal as it deems appropriate the secs action is designed to ensure that the cboes and c2s rules and procedures are consistent with the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act 

cboe holdings 

certain aspects of cboe holdings are subject to sec oversight including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders the focus of the secs regulation of cboe holdings is to assure adequate representation of trading permit holders and public market participants in the governance of the cboe and c2 exchanges as well as to ensure that each can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the exchange act furthermore the sec requires that cboe holdings give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of the cboe and 

c2 exchanges and to cboe holdings obligations to investors and the general public the sec also requires that cboe holdings not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of either cboe or c2 relating to their regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of the exchanges to carry out their responsibilities under the exchange act to the extent that cboe holdings business activities involve or relate to the exchanges the officers and directors of cboe holdings may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws accordingly the sec may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain cboe holdings activities and those activities may be subject to sec approval and in some cases public notice and comment 

futures industrycfe 

the operations of cfe are subject to regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations establish nonfinancial criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts 

cfe is a designated contract market that is subject to the oversight of the cftc and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the commodity exchange act cfe has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance with rules pertaining to the trading position sizes delivery obligations and financial condition of trading privilege holders 

the national futures association nfa is performing most of these functions pursuant to a regulatory services agreement with cfe cfe retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace cfe also remains responsible for bringing disciplinary actions against trading privilege holders including the ability to issue fines in the case of serious rule violations in the case of financially distressed trading privilege holders cfe may take various emergency actions to protect customers other trading privilege holders and cfe cfe is also a party to cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements with other sros and is a member of the intermarket surveillance group 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in 2010 amended the core principles with which designated contract markets like cfe must comply under the commodity exchange act the cftc has proposed a number of new regulations applicable to designated contract markets in order to implement the amended core principles these proposals include among others certain ownership and voting restrictions on stockholders like those required by the sec for securities exchanges other regulations designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and regulations relating to the trading rules that designated contract markets may implement cfe is presently evaluating the potential impact of these proposed regulations and cannot predict or estimate the full extent to which the proposals may affect cfe or its operations

our options exchanges are responsible for taking steps to ensure that their trading permit holders comply with the exchanges rules and with the applicable rules of the sec the main activities that the exchanges engage in to measure compliance with these rules include 1 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect violations of exchange trading rules 2 the review of surveillance exception reports designed to detect possible manipulation 3 the further investigation of matters deemed to be problematic upon review of the exception reports or matters deemed to be problematic as a result of examinations 4 the investigation of complaints about possible rule violations brought by customers members or other sros and 5 the examination of cboe and c2 trading permit holders for compliance with rules such as those related to net capital books and records and other related matters as further described below each option exchange is also responsible for reviewing its trading permit holders activities related to the conduct of business directly with public customers or sales practice we have delegated the responsibility to conduct sales practice examinations for options to finra except that we retain responsibility for some of the sales practice examinations of trading permit holders that are not also members of finra or another us securities exchange 

section 17d of the exchange act and the related exchange act rules permit sros to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation under exchange act rule 17d1 the sec designates one sro to be the designated examining authority dea for each brokerdealer that is a member of more than one sro the dea is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the financial aspects of that brokerdealer we are the dea for many of our members 

exchange act rule 17d2 permits sros to enter into agreements commonly called rule 17d2 agreements which are approved by the sec and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those sros and relating to members those sros have in common we have entered into 17d2 agreements under which finra is allocated responsibility for enforcing rules related to options sales practices with respect to cboe and c2 trading permit holders and insider trading rules with respect to cbsx trading permit holders we have entered into another 17d2 agreement which allocated responsibility to each sro for ensuring that their allocated common members complied with rules governing expiring exercise declarations options position limits and large options position reporting and position adjustments 

on june 5 2006 the sec approved a national market system plan named the options regulatory surveillance authority plan orsa plan the purpose of the orsa plan is to permit the us securities options exchanges to act jointly in the administration operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed material information in trading in one or more of their markets through the sharing of the costs of these regulatory activities and the sharing of the regulatory information generated under the orsa plan the orsa plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and the national market system for options and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts the orsa policy committee has determined to delegate the operation of the surveillance and investigative facility contemplated by the orsa plan to cboe the exchanges have entered into a regulatory services agreement with cboe as service provider pursuant to which cboe performs certain regulatory and surveillance functions under the orsa plan and uses its automated insider trading surveillance system to perform these functions on behalf of the exchanges the orsa plan permits the exchanges to provide for the joint performance of other regulatory or surveillance functions or activities that the exchanges determine to bring within the scope of the orsa plan but any determination to expand the functions or activities under the orsa plan would require an amendment to the orsa plan subject to sec approval 

in order to ensure market integrity we extensively regulate and monitor our trading permit holders trading activities we believe cboe and c2 are efficient regulators which is vital to attracting 

and retaining the confidence and participation of marketmakers brokerdealers and institutional and retail investors 

we expend considerable time financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities exchange industry and within the regulatory regime overseen by the sec our primary regulator in order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our option exchange rules we have developed our own automated market surveillance systems to monitor market activity on our option exchanges and across us options markets 

as part of the selfregulatory process disciplinary matters other than minor matters covered by our minor rule violation plan are reviewed by our business conduct committee which includes both market participants and public representatives we are also a participant in the intermarket surveillance group isg isg is an informationsharing cooperative governed by a written agreement the purpose of the isg is to provide a framework for the sharing of information and the coordination of regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses 

opra plan cta plan cq plan and nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan 

cboe and c2 are member exchanges in opra the opra limited liability company agreement which has been approved by the sec provides that any securities exchange approved by the sec for the trading of securities options may become a member exchange of opra the agreement sets forth a system for reporting options information that is administered by the member exchanges through opra a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges opra is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchangelisted securities options in the us and it disseminates certain core trading information such as last sale reports and quotations we also participate in the consolidated tape association or cta the consolidated quotation plan or cq plan and the nasdaq unlisted trading privileges plan which perform analogous services for the us equities markets the securities industry automation corporation siac acts as the processor for opra cta and the cq plan the nyse owns siac the nasdaq acts as the processor for the nasdaq unlisted trading plan 

options intermarket linkage plan 

the sec approved the original options intermarket linkage plan the linkage plan in 2000 the linkage plan was designed to facilitate the routing of orders between exchanges in furtherance of a national market system the principal purposes of a national market system is to promote price protection and to assure that brokers may execute investors orders at the best market price the linkage plan generally is designed to enable the options exchanges and their members to avoid executing a trade at a price inferior to the best price displayed by any of the options exchanges referred to as a tradethrough the options exchanges implemented a new linkage plan on august 31 2009 to replace the original linkage plan under the new plan direct exchangetoexchange access through brokerdealers is used to transmit intermarket sweep orders similar to sweep orders that are available in the stock market under regulation nms

seasonality 

in the securities industry quarterly revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to seasonal variations in trading volumes competition and technological and regulatory changes typically revenues are lowest in the third quarter primarily in august due to reduced trading activity during the summer months

 item 1a risk factors 

certain statements contained in this report under various sections including business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see forwardlooking statements these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the listed options market depends on a national market structure that facilitates the efficient buying and selling of underlying stocks futures and other products changes in regulation by the sec or other government action could materially affect our markets for example the sec is considering new rules related to short selling in addition to the restrictions implemented in may 2010 that could impact the use of options by both members and customers in particular the current restrictions on short selling do not contain an options market maker exception and could adversely affect the ability of options marketmakers to conduct their business on our exchanges in addition the sec has proposed a rule that would ban the use of flash orders we believe that prohibiting flash orders would eliminate price improvement opportunities and create additional execution costs for our customers we cannot predict what future actions the sec might take with respect to its rulemakings on short selling flash orders or other matters or the impact that any such actions may have on our business if our market participants reduce or otherwise modify their trading activity on our exchanges due to proposed or actual regulatory changes our business operating results and financial condition may be materially impacted see also —legislative or regulatory changes particularly in response to adverse financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the sec also published for comment in 2010 proposed rule amendments that if adopted as proposed would place a 030 per contract limit on the total access fees that an exchange may charge for the execution of an order against a quotation that is the best bid or best offer of such exchange in a listed option we cannot predict whether the sec will adopt the fee cap as proposed a modified version or at all the potential impact to our revenues however would depend on changes in our contract volume and product mix in future periods as well as other factors including those that are currently being considered as part of the rulemaking process for example in its release the sec asks whether the proposed fee cap should only apply to multiplylisted options if the proposed rules are adopted as proposed or are adopted in a form substantially similar to that proposed and we are unable to change our fee structure in response to the rules as adopted they would have a material adverse effect on our business result of operations and financial condition see also business—regulatory environment and compliance—recent developments—fee caps 

loss of our exclusive licenses to list certain index options could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the sp 500 index the sp 100 index and the djia granted to us by the owners of such indexes in 2010 approximately 35 of our transaction fees was generated by our exclusivelylicensed index products up from 32 in 2009 revenue attributable to spx our sp 500 index option product and our largest product by revenue represented 98 of the transaction fees generated by our exclusivelylicensed index products up from 92 in 2009 as a result our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products 

the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options depends on the continued ability of index owners to grant us licenses or require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes although recent court decisions have allowed the trading of options on etfs based on indexes without licenses from the owners of the underlying indexes none of these decisions has overturned existing legal precedent that requires an exchange to be licensed by the owner of an underlying index before it may list options based on the index however in two pending cases international securities exchange inc or ise is seeking a judicial determination that it and by extension other options exchanges has the right to list options on the sp 500 index and the djia without licenses and therefore without regard to our exclusive licenses to list securities options on those indexes 

because these cases are still pending there remains a risk that ise may be successful in obtaining a judicial determination eliminating the right of index owners to require licenses to use their indexes for options trading including on an exclusive basis in addition competing exchanges may convince the sec or seek a judicial action to limit the right of index owners to grant exclusive licenses for index options trading or to prevent exchanges from entering into such exclusive licenses if unlicensed trading of index options were permitted or if exclusive licenses for index options trading were prohibited or limited the value of our exclusive licenses would be eliminated and we likely would lose market share in these index options an adverse ruling in the ise litigation could also result in legal challenges to our exclusive use of our proprietary indexes for options 

there is also a risk with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses that the owner of the index may not to renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all in the first event we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product resulting in a loss of market share and negatively impacting the profitability of the licensed products in the second event we could lose the right to list the index product entirely the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability see business—products—strategic relationships for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates 

furthermore our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of indexbased products that are economically similar to those for which we have exclusive licenses it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in indexbased products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license 

recently we agreed with sp that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the sp 500 index that meet certain criteria some of which are currently under negotiation and that sp will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue the clearing of options on the sp 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges and there can be no assurance that any revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are generated by our transactionbased business if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases our revenues from transaction fees will decrease 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 76 74 and 83 of our operating revenues respectively were generated by our transactionbased business this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants decide to reduce their level of trading activity for any reason such as 

• a reduction in the number of traders that use us • a reduction in trading demand by customers • heightened capital maintenance requirements or other regulatory or legislative requirements • reduced access to capital required to fund trading activities or • significant market disruptions if the amount of our trading volume decreases our revenues from transaction fees will decrease there may also be a reduction in revenue from market data fees or other sources of revenue if our share of total trading volumes decreases relative to our competitors our markets may be less attractive to market participants and we may lose trading volume and associated transaction fees and market data fees as a result 

intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance 

competition among options exchanges has intensified since cboe was created in 1973 and we expect this trend to continue we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts including the cost quality and speed of our trade execution the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform the range of our products and services our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation our principal competitors are the seven other us options exchanges we also compete against investment banks and others trading options overthecounter 

we currently face greater competition than ever before in our history virtually all of the equity options and options on etfs listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other us options exchanges some orderproviding firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us thereby giving those firms an added incentive to direct orders to the exchanges they own as a result of these competitive developments our market share of options traded in the us fell from approximately 45 in 2000 to approximately 29 in 2010 

in response to these developments we developed our own electronic trading facility that we operate as part of a hybrid model combining electronic trading and remote offfloor marketmakers with traditional floorbased open outcry trading we also administer a program through which we collect a marketing fee on market maker transactions the funds collected are made available to the specialist and preferred marketmakers for use in payment for order flow finally in october 2010 we launched c2 our allelectronic exchange these changes may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in the future likewise our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share 

in addition many of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial marketing technological personnel and other resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can 

furthermore our competitors may 

• respond more quickly to competitive pressures • develop products that compete with our products or are preferred by our customers • price their products and services more competitively • develop and expand their technology and service offerings more efficiently • provide better more userfriendly and more reliable technology • take greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities • market promote and sell their products and services more effectively • leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners more effectively or exploit brand names to market and sell their services and • exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets including overthecounter markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model in recent years the derivatives industry has witnessed increased consolidation among market participants including option exchanges and marketplaces consolidation and alliances among our competitors may create greater liquidity than we offer as a result the larger liquidity pools may attract orders away from us leading to reductions in trading volume and liquidity and therefore to decreased revenues in addition consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do 

if our products markets services and technology are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate see business—competition 

our business may be adversely affected by price competition 

the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and we and our competitors have adjusted our transaction fees and fee structures accordingly some competitors have introduced a market model in which orders that take liquidity from the market are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity receive a rebate these changes have resulted in significant pricing and cost pressures on us it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing 

their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets in addition one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading if any of these or other events occur our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected for example we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner also our profit margins could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees 

we may not be able to generate a significant amount of incremental operating revenues by making trading access available in exchange for a fee 

prior to our restructuring the ability to trade on cboe was an inherent right of every cboe membership and owners of cboe seats either used the cboe seat to trade or leased the cboe seat to an individual or firm who used it to trade as a result of the restructuring transaction trading access was separated from ownership the right to trade on cboe was made available through trading permits for which the user paid a fee these fees effective july 1 2010 accounted for and in the future are expected to account for a significant portion of our operating revenues if the demand for access to cboe is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates our ability to generate incremental operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our profitability 

market fluctuations and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business 

the volume of options transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control including 

• broad trends in business and finance • concerns about terrorism and war • concerns over inflation and wavering institutional or retail confidence levels • changes in government monetary policy and foreign currency exchange rates • the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital • the availability of alternative investment opportunities • changes in the level of trading activity in underlying instruments • changes and volatility in the prices of securities • the level and volatility of interest rates and • unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading general economic conditions affect options trading in a variety of ways from the availability of capital to investor confidence the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business economic and political conditions throughout the world adverse changes in the economy can have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume because our management structure and overhead costs will be based on assumptions of certain levels of market activity significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

one of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name this reputation could be harmed in many different ways including by regulatory failures governance failures or technology failures damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to attract customers liquidity providers and order flow which in turn could impair the competitiveness of our markets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology proprietary index products index methodologies and other proprietary rights in addition we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusivelylicensed index products we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our intellectual property without authorization listing our proprietary or exclusivelylicensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues any of which could materially adversely affect our business for a description of current litigation involving among other things these matters please see legal proceedings 

computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business 

we must operate monitor and maintain our computer systems and network services including those related to our electronic trading systems in a secure and reliable manner a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the functionality and reliability of our market our reputation business financial condition and operating results system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulators file lawsuits against us or cease doing business with us it could also lead regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations any of these effects could harm our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely in our operations may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions 

the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems and communications networks and those of our service providers and market participants is a critical element of our operations these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems as well as to acts of terrorism natural disasters and other force majeure events if our security measures are compromised or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks our business financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including harm to reputation and litigation caused by any breaches in security or system failures although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures and otherwise to provide for the integrity and reliability of our systems these measures may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to keep up with rapid technological changes 

our industry has experienced and will continue to experience rapid technological change changes in use and customer requirements and preferences frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and features of our automated trading and communications systems this will require us to continue to attract and retain a highlyskilled technology staff and invest the financial resources necessary to keep our systems up to date if we fail to do so our systems could become less competitive which could result in the loss of customers and trading volume and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our decision to operate a second marketplace may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in october 2010 we launched a second exchange c2 c2 operates separately from cboe with its own governance structure and systems c2 operates as an electronic marketplace and is capable of trading all of cboes products we have spent substantial funds and incurred significant capital expenditures on the development of c2 c2 may be unable to generate sufficient transaction volume and cash flow to provide a satisfactory return on our investment it also is possible that member firms may choose not to connect to c2 for instance because they may conclude that doing so will not attract sufficient order flow to justify the connection cost a failure of c2 as an exchange could result in a write off of all or some portion of our investment in c2s development and could negatively affect our reputation 

a significant portion of our cost structure is fixed if our operating revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our cost structure is fixed meaning that such portion of our cost structure is generally independent of trading volume salaries and benefits which represented 243 of our total operating expenses in 2010 are our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market rather than trading volumes if demand for our products and services declines our operating revenues will decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure at all or on a timely basis to counteract a decrease in revenue which would result in an adverse impact on our profitability moreover if demand for future products that we acquire or license is not at the level necessary to offset the cost of the acquisition or license our net income would decline 

our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated due to a decline in our market share regulatory action or a reduction in the number of market data users 

we obtain approximately 36 of our operating revenues from our share of the revenues collected by the options price reporting authority or opra for the dissemination of options market data if our share of options trading were to decline our share of opra market data revenue would also decline market data revenue could also decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise finally the sec could take regulatory action to revise the formula for allocating options market data revenues among the options exchanges as it has in the past or it could take other regulatory action that could have the effect of reducing total options market data revenue or our share of that revenue any significant decline in the revenue we realize from the dissemination of market data could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed 

our future success depends in large part on our management team which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business the failure to retain certain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy 

our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our compliance and technology functions many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation if we fail to retain our current employees it would be difficult and costly to identify recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business in particular failure to retain and attract qualified systems and compliance personnel could result in systems errors or regulatory infractions consequently our reputation may be harmed we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline 

we may not effectively manage our growth which could materially harm our business 

we expect that our business will continue to grow which may place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures and we will need to continue to expand train and manage our technology workforce we must also maintain close coordination among our technology compliance accounting finance marketing and sales functions we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively if we fail to do so our business could be materially harmed 

our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and we will need to integrate train and manage a growing employee base the expansion of our existing businesses any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary further unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 

we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of service providers including banking and clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms processors of market information such as the consolidated tape association and opra and various vendors of communications and networking products and services we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if our risk management methods are not effective our business reputation and financial results may be adversely affected 

we have methods to identify monitor and manage our risks however these methods may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods may depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed our business reputation financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

current economic conditions could make it difficult for us to finance our future operations 

companies in many different industries have found it difficult to borrow money from banks and other lending sources and have also experienced difficulty raising funds in the capital markets continued instability in the financial markets as a result of recession or otherwise may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital although we have no current need for additional financing if we need to raise funds in the future our ability to do so could be impaired if rating agencies lenders or investors develop a negative perception of our financial prospects or the prospects for our industry if difficult market conditions continue or if a negative perception of our financial prospects were to develop we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all 

we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or integrating other businesses products or technologies with our business any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect the market price of our unrestricted common stock 

we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material we may enter into these transactions to acquire other businesses products or technologies expand our products and services advance our technology or take advantage of new developments and potential changes in the industry 

the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive particularly in light of ongoing consolidation in the exchange sector as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully further our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us 

the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business further as a result of any future acquisition or strategic transaction we may issue additional shares of our stock that dilute stockholders ownership interest in us expend cash incur debt assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets with estimable useful lives in addition difficulties in integrating the businesses or any negative impact on the regulatory functions of any of our companies could harm the reputation of the companies we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected any 

of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

risks relating to litigation and regulation 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained or may obtain patents that are related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products services or technologies in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications thus we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry if one or more of our products services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party we may be required to stop developing or marketing those products services or technologies obtain a license to develop and market those services from the holders of the patents or redesign those products services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent if we were required to stop developing or marketing certain products our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed moreover if we were unable to obtain required licenses we may not be able to redesign our products services or technologies to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for a discussion of patent litigation involving us please see legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations 

cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchange and selfregulatory organizations or sros and as such are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the sec has broad powers to audit investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros pursuant to the exchange act and the secs rules and regulations under the exchange act if the sec were to find cboe or c2s program of enforcement and compliance to be deficient cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions including revocation of its registration as a national securities exchange any such investigations or proceedings whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and potential harm to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition although cboe and c2 intend to retain their responsibilities as sros they may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate 

cfe is a designated contract market registered with the cftc because cfe is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc cfe is subject to substantially similar risks with respect to its regulatory and legal obligations as cboe and c2 in relation to their regulation by the sec 

although cboe holdings itself is not an sro cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges specifically the sec will exercise oversight over the 

governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with the cboe and c2 see regulatory environment and compliance—regulatory responsibilities 

legislative or regulatory changes particularly in response to adverse financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in recent years the securities trading industry and in particular the securities markets have been subject to significant regulatory changes moreover in the past three years the securities markets have been the subject of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis 

in response to the economic crisis congress passed the doddfrank act and other legislation it is possible that there will be additional legislative changes and changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate our businesses although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time for example the sec published a concept release early in 2010 related to trading in equity markets that could result in changes in the competitive landscape in the options market actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the us such as fee caps colocation highfrequency trading derivatives clearing market transparency taxes on stock transactions restrictions on proprietary trading by certain of our customers and other related proposals could have a material impact on our business for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes see businesss—regulatory environment and compliance 

we and our market participants also operate in a highly regulated industry congress the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets legislative and regulatory changes by congress the sec or other regulatory authorities could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential conflicts of interest between our forprofit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business 

as a forprofit business with regulatory responsibilities there may be a conflict of interest between our regulatory responsibilities and the interests of some of our market participants any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation increase regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor record and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed 

our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes 

our subsidiaries registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and in many cases its approval even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec the sec retains the right to abrogate such rule changes the sec review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets if the sec refuses to approve a proposed rule change or delays its approval this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business decisions 

similarly the sec must approve amendments to our subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings the sec may not approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products 

misconduct by our customers or others could harm us 

although we perform significant selfregulatory functions we run the risk that our trading permit holders other persons who use our markets or our employees will engage in fraud or other misconduct which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

changes in the tax structure affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there are currently proposals in both the illinois and federal legislatures that if implemented would change the existing structure for options and futures market participants in illinois the proposal would create a financial transaction tax which would impose a tax of 001 on the value of any transaction on our exchange if such a tax were implemented it could cause us competitive harm since exchanges outside of illinois would not be subject to the tax and would increase the cost of trading options on our exchange which could reduce trading in options 

at the federal level there is a proposal that calls for repeal of the 6040 rule which allows marketmakers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income in addition federal legislation has been introduced that would impose a new tax on securities futures and swap transactions including exchangetraded options if either the proposed repeal of the 6040 rule or a transaction tax were to become law the resulting additional taxes could have a negative impact on the options industry and us by making options transactions more costly to market participants 

risks relating to our common stock 

your percentage ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued 

we may seek to raise capital to finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders our board of directors has the authority without action or vote of the stockholders to issue our authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock future issuances of common or preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote and would be dilutive to earnings per share in addition any newly issued preferred stock could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock those rights preferences and privileges could include among other things the establishment of dividends that must be paid prior to declaring or paying dividends or other distributions to holders of our common stock greater or preferential liquidation rights which could negatively affect the rights of holders of our common stock and the right to convert such preferred stock into shares of our common stock at a rate or price that would have a dilutive effect on the outstanding shares of our common stock 

the sale of large amounts of our common stock following the automatic conversion of our class a2 common stock into shares of unrestricted common stock may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

our shares of class a2 common stock are subject to significant transfer restrictions that expire on june 13 2011 upon expiration of these restrictions the shares of class a2 common stock held by 

existing stockholders will automatically convert into shares of unrestricted common stock and will be freely transferable unless the shares are held by affiliates within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act if our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock upon the expiration of the transfer restrictions the market price for our common stock could decline significantly 

our trading permit holders own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock which could be used to influence how our business is operated to the detriment of other holders of our common stock 

immediately following our demutualization and initial public offering approximately 73 of our common stock was issued to former cboe seat holders a significant number of which are trading permit holders all of our outstanding class a2 common stock is currently held by former cboe seat holders our stockholders who are also trading permit holders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of stockholders who are not trading permit holders stockholders who are trading permit holders own a substantial portion of our voting stock as a result they could exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

many of our trading permit holders derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading on or through our exchanges the amount of income that they derive from their trading activities is in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading permit holders many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules access privileges and fee discounts that enhance their trading opportunities and profits as a result other holders of our common stock may not have the same economic interests as our trading permit holders consequently trading permit holders may advocate that we enhance and protect their trading opportunities and the value they receive through their trading permits over their economic interest in us represented by the common stock that they own the share ownership of our trading permit holders could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance stockholder value 

any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries accordingly there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders 

we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders however any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount the boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own cboe holdings will depend entirely on distributions if any it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders if these subsidiaries are not profitable or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders 

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for us that a stockholder might consider favorable these include provisions 

• prohibiting the stockholders from acting by written consent 42 

• requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders • requiring the vote of majority of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and • limiting the persons who may call special stockholders meetings in addition our organizational documents include provisions that 

• restrict any person from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 20 of our outstanding voting capital stock and • restrict any person from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of our capital stock furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 

in addition delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors wishes under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporations board of directors

components of operating revenues 

transaction fees 

the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fee revenue transaction fee revenue is a function of three variables 1 exchange fee rates 2 trading volume and 3 transaction mix between contract type because trading fees are assessed on a per contract basis exchange fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the companys exchanges while exchange fee rates are established by the company trading volume and transaction mix are primarily influenced by factors outside its control these external factors include price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions recently the sec published for comment proposed rule amendments that if adopted as proposed would place a 030 per contract side limit on the total access fees that an exchange may charge for the execution of an order against a quotation that is the best bid or best offer of such exchange in a listed option if the proposed rules are adopted as proposed or are adopted in a form substantially similar to that proposed they would reduce transaction fees materially see business—regulatory environment and compliance—recent developments—fee caps 

revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a tradedate basis transaction fee revenue accounted for 755 738 and 825 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the main option categories traded are equities indexes and exchangetraded funds etfs the equity options category reflects trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies the index options category reflects trading in index options contracts on market indexes and on the interest rates of us treasury securities etfs options are baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index but which trade like individual stocks 

the following chart illustrates total options trading volumes during the last three years 



the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the growth in the use of options represents a longterm trend that will continue in the future furthermore we believe significant opportunities exist to expand 

the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the overthecounter market to exchanges 

while there is no certainty we expect that the industrywide and companyspecific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes therefore if these same factors continue to exist we may experience similar changes in contract trading volume however additional factors may arise that could offset future increases in contract trading volume or result in a decline in contract trading volume such as new or existing competition or other events accordingly recent contract trading volume history may not be an indicator of future contract trading volume 

access fees 

on july 1 2010 the company began charging monthly fees to trading permit holders under the new trading access program under the new program cboe charges monthly access fees to all trading permit holders the trading access program could be impacted by seasonality and market fluctuations that affect trading volume 

prior to july 1 2010 access fees represented fees assessed to temporary members and interim trading permit holders for the right to trade at cboe and dues charged to members the fees assessed temporary members and interim trading permit holders were based on average lease rates and the number of temporary access points and interim trading permits 

in 2009 access fees revenue primarily resulted from the recognition of temporary member access fees collected in 2007 and 2008 that were deferred until the final nonappealable resolution of the delaware action pursuant to the settlement agreement 

access fees accounted for 95 106 and 14 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

exchange services and other fees 

to facilitate trading the company offers trading floor space technology services terminal and other equipment rentals maintenance services and telecommunications services trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a monthtomonth basis facilities systems services and other fees are generally monthly feebased although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics while others are based solely on demand exchange services and other fees accounted for 39 53 and 59 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively revenue from exchange services and other fees has been flat to trending down as a greater number of market participants access our exchanges through electronic means rather than in an open outcry environment 

market data fees 

market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority opra and the companys market data services opra is not consolidated with the company opra gathers market data from various options exchanges including cboe and c2 and in turn disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data we are members of a management committee with other member exchanges that administer the opra limited liability agreement revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the relative number of trades executed by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter a trade consists of a single transaction but may consist of several contracts each member exchanges share of market data revenue generated by opra is calculated on a per trade basis and is not based on the underlying number of contracts 

the company also derives revenue from the direct sale of a wide range of current and historical market data market data fees accounted for 49 48 and 51 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

regulatory fees 

regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as self regulatory organizations under the exchange act historically most of this revenue was based on the number of registered representatives that a cboe member firm maintained beginning on march 1 2009 cboe began charging the options regulatory fee instead under which fees are based on the number of customer contracts executed by each firm this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holder declines and rates are not increased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease regulatory fees accounted for 35 36 and 26 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

other revenue 

other revenue accounted for 27 19 and 25 of our total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the following subcategories are the primary sources of revenue within other revenues

the market linkage program is intended to encourage brokerdealers to route customer orders to cboe rather than to our competitors and provides our liquidity providers the opportunity to quote on the order while saving customers the execution fee they would otherwise incur by routing directly to a competing exchange if a competing exchange quotes a better price we route the customers order to that exchange and pay the associated costs regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our exchanges the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers market linkage expenses vary based on the volume of contracts linked to other exchanges and fees charged by other exchanges costs incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges are passedthrough to the original order sending firm 

cboe provides an incentive to marketmakers for transactions in a penny pilot class to qualify for the incentive 60 of the marketmakers quotes in that class in the prior period must be on one side of the national best bid and offer nbbo

operating revenues 

total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were 4371 million an increase of 110 million or 26 compared with the prior year the following summarizes changes in total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009 



transaction fees 

transaction fees increased 50 to 3303 million for the year ended december 31 2010 representing 756 of total operating revenues compared with 3145 million for the prioryear period or 738 of total operating revenues this increase was largely driven by a 61 increase in average transaction fee per contract partially offset by a decrease in trading volume of 11 the following summarizes transaction fees by product for 2010 compared to 2009 



trading volume 

the companys average daily trading volume adv was 446 million contracts in 2010 down 11 compared with 451 million for 2009 total trading days in 2010 and 2009 were two hundred and fiftytwo the following summarizes changes in total trading volume and adv by product for 2010 compared to 2009 



average transaction fee per contract 

the average transaction fee per contract was 0294 in 2010 an increase of 61 compared with 0277 in 2009 average transaction fee per contract represents transaction fees divided by total contracts in general the company faces continued downward pressure on transaction fees in the markets in which we compete the following summarizes average transaction fee per contract by product for 2010 compared to 2009 



there are a number of factors that have contributed to the increase in our average transaction fee per contract in 2010 compared to 2009 these include 

• product mix— the increase in the average transaction fee per contract reflects a shift in the volume mix by product indexes accounted for 242 and 196 of total options contracts in 2010 and 2009 respectively this product category represents the companys highestmargin option product and its volume contributed to the increase in the total average transaction fee per contract • premium index products— we believe our premium index products warrant the same or higher pricing for customer and voluntary professional orders as our marketmaker member firm and brokerdealer orders and for all nonpublic customer transactions these products include options on all licensed and proprietary index options and futures contract volume in premium products increased in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 132 and 874 increase in spx and vix options respectively as a percentage of total index options volume for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 spx and vix accounted for 649 and 231 respectively and 695 and 150 respectively as a percentage of total index options transaction fees for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 spx and vix accounted for 700 and 188 respectively and 733 and 124 respectively • new order type— in 2010 cboe implemented a new order type referred to as professional the purpose of the new order type is to distinguish between those public customer orders routed to cboe that are for nonprofessional retail investors and those public customer orders that are for persons or entities that have access to information and technology that enables them to professionally trade listed options in the same manner as a brokerdealer in the prior year cboe did not charge transaction fees for these types of orders as they were included in the order type customer • impact of clearing firm sliding scale— cboe has a program that based on attainment of certain volume levels allows clearing firms to be assessed reduced transaction fees within a specific month the program provides for a reduction of transaction fees at five distinct volume levels each level achieved provides a further reduction in transaction fees the clearing firm sliding scale applies to clearing firm trading permit holders proprietary orders in all products except for certain excluded orders for the year ended december 31 2010 the number of transactions that occurred at a lower price on the clearing firm sliding scale increased compared to the prioryear period due to an increase in permit holders qualifying for the reduced fees an 60 

increase in the number of contracts traded by those permit holders and an increase in the number of contracts traded by the permit holders achieving the highest level of reduced fees we believe the increase in qualifying permit holders and contracts qualifying for the largest fee reduction negatively impacted average transaction fee per contract in general and was the primary contributor to the decrease in the per contract fee received for equities 

• 99 or less contracts— effective may 2009 cboe waived transaction fees for customer orders of 99 contracts or less in the exchangetraded fund category we believe the waived contract fees are a contributing factor to the reduction of average transaction fee per contract for exchangetraded funds for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 we have and will continue to change our fees in the future in light of the competitive pressures in the options industry these future fee changes may increase or decrease our average transaction fee per contract our average transaction fee may also increase or decrease based on changes in trading patterns of marketmakers and orderflow providers which is based on factors not in our control our average transaction fee will also change if proposed sec rule changes are adopted as proposed 

at december 31 2010 there were approximately 95 cboe clearing firms two of which cleared a combined 48 of our billings collected through the occ in 2010 the next largest clearing firm accounted for approximately 5 of our billings collected through the occ no one affiliate of either of the top two clearing firms represented more than 15 of that revenue in 2010 or 2009 should a clearing firm withdraw from cboe we believe the affiliate portion of that firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm therefore we do not believe cboe is exposed to a significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm 

the two largest clearing firms mentioned above clear the majority of the marketmaker sides of transactions at cboe and at all of the us options exchanges if either of these firms were to withdraw from the business of marketmaker clearing and marketmakers were unable to make new clearing arrangements this could create significant disruption to the us options markets including cboe 

access fees 

access fees for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased to 414 million from 451 million in the comparable prior year period representing 95 and 106 of total operating revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively

in 2009 access fees revenue primarily resulted from the recognition of 383 million in temporary member access fees due to the final nonappealable resolution of the delaware action pursuant to the settlement agreement and 58 million in interim trading permit revenue the 383 million includes 241 million of fees collected in 2008 and 2007 included in deferred revenue at december 31 2008 pending final nonappealable resolution of the delaware action pursuant to the settlement agreement these amounts were partially offset by 19 million paid by cboe to compensate members for unleased memberships in accordance with the interim trading permit program cboe instituted the interim trading permit program and lessor compensation plan in july 2008 

exchange services and other fees 

exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased 252 to 169 million from 226 million in the comparable period in the prior year representing 39 and 53 of total operating revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease can primarily be attributed to the elimination of hybrid electronic quoting fees on january 1 2010 which totaled a net assessed amount of 37 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to an overall reduction in fees charged for data services provided by exchanges and other information vendors to exchange participants due to a reduction in demand for the services 

market data fees 

market data fees increased 39 to 213 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 205 million in the same period in the prior year this category accounted for 49 and 48 of total operating revenues for the years ended 2010 and 2009 respectively market data fees represent income derived from opra as well as the companys market data services opra and company market data fees were 156 million and 57 million respectively and 191 million and 14 million respectively for the years ended 2010 and 2009 respectively opra income is allocated through opra based on each exchanges share of total options transactions cleared the companys share of opra income for the period ended december 31 2010 decreased to 259 from 306 for the same period in 2009 due to a decrease in total options transactions cleared by its options exchanges the companys market data services provide users with current and historical options and futures data the increase in the companys market data fees is due to the introduction of new market data products in the first quarter of 2010 

regulatory fees

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased 213 million or 86 to 2698 million for the year ended 2010 from 2485 million in the year ago period this increase was primarily due to higher employee costs depreciation and amortization and royalty fees partially offset by a decrease in trading volume incentives expenses increased to 618 of total operating revenues in the year ended 2010 compared with 583 in the same period in 2009 

the following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased by 24 million to 299 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with 275 million for the same period in 2009 primarily reflecting additions to fixed assets placed in service in 2010 and 2009 on october 29 2010 c2 began operations with the launch of c2 assets totaling approximately 244 million were reclassified from construction and software in progress to furniture and equipment and data processing and other software respectively the depreciation expense for these assets totaled 08 million in 2010 the remaining increase in depreciation is primarily attributable to fixed asset additions for purchases of systems hardware and software to enhance system functionality and expand capacity depreciation and amortization charges represented 68 and 65 of total operating revenues for the years ended 2010 and 2009 respectively 

data processing 

data processing expenses decreased 10 million to 195 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with 205 million in the prioryear period representing 45 and 48 of total operating revenues in the years ended 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in data processing expenses is primarily due to upgrades in hardware technology allowing for reduced maintenance costs fewer subscriptions to external data resources due to migration from open outcry to electronic trading and growth in external extranet vendorsconnectivity which reduced managed network costs 

outside services 

expenses related to outside services increased to 312 million for the year ended 2010 from 307 million in the prioryear period and represented 71 and 72 of total operating revenues respectively the 05 million increase primarily reflects higher legal accounting and auditing expenses partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees

royalty fees 

royalty fees expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 414 million compared with 331 million for the prior year period an increase of 83 million or 251 this increase is directly related to an increase in trading volume in cboes licensed options products and a fee increase on certain licensed index products for the year ended 2010 compared with 2009 royalty fees represented 95 and 78 of total operating revenues for the years ended 2010 and 2009 respectively

facilities costs

there are a number of factors that have contributed to the decrease in our average transaction fee per contract in 2009 compared to 2008 these include 

• product mix— the decrease in the average transaction fee per contract reflects a shift in the volume mix by product indexes and exchangetraded funds accounted for 196 and 244 and 217 and 276 of total options contracts in 2009 and 2008 respectively since these product categories represent the companys highestmargin products their decline as a percent of total volume contributed to the decrease in the total average transaction fee per contract • premium products— contract volume in premium products declined in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 135 decline in spx which accounted for approximately 695 of the total index options volume in 2009 the decline in spx volume was offset somewhat by a 284 increase in vix in 2009 compared with 2008 as a percentage of total index revenue for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 spx and vix accounted for 741 and 124 respectively and 734 and 98 respectively • higher percentage of customer orders— as a percent of total contracts customer orders have increased from 384 in 2008 to 403 in 2009 as a result of competitive pressures in 2009 we eliminated transaction fees for customer orders of 99 contracts or less in etfs as well as holding company depositary receipts or holdrs • member firm proprietary volumes— our member firm proprietary volumes increased in 2009 however member firms pay a variable rate based on a sliding scale which decreases as volumes increase this increase in volume contributed to our overall decrease in average transaction fee per contract • large trade discounts— to encourage large trades cboe has a customer large trade discount program in the form of a cap on customer transaction fees including its premium products these discounts contributed to the decrease in our average rate per contract in 2009 access fees
