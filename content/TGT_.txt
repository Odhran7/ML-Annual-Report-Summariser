 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our shareholders guests team members and vendors choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving those constituencies and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation our reputation is based in large part on perceptions both about us and others with whom we do business and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate target’s responses to crises and our position or perceived lack of position on environmental social and governance esg matters such as sustainability responsible sourcing and diversity equity and inclusion dei and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents involving us or others with whom we do business can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts workforce unrest or walkouts government investigations or litigation for example we have a limited ability to end our relationship with cvs which leases space to operate their clinics and pharmacies within our stores if our guests have negative experiences with or unfavorably view cvs or other companies with whom we have relationships it could cause them to reduce or stop their business with us negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business and results of operations including through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the environmental impact of our business the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels the value and exclusivity of our offerings and our efforts to source merchandise responsibly and ethically are among the factors that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

our owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent approximately onethird of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the retail industrys continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate from other retailers in particular consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools consumers may also use thirdparty channels or devices such as voice assistants and smart home devices to initiate shopping searches and place orders which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts or actions by our competitors in response to these efforts could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 





if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests across multiple channels our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interacting with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and our vendors we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offerings providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times lowcost or free shipping and desired payment methods even when we are successful in meeting fulfillment expectations if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and beverage and others if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict and quickly respond to changing consumer preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our results of operations during the covid19 pandemic many guests significantly reduced their spending on dining travel lodging and other leisure activities outside their homes which may have contributed to our increased sales particularly for essential items and merchandise associated with guests spending more time at home if we are unable to effectively adapt if or when guests increase spending on other categories it could lead to lower sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores improving technology and expanding our supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our store remodel program uses a custom approach based on the characteristics of each store and surrounding neighborhood and is expected to be a continuous part of our operations to allow us to meet evolving expectations for instore experience fulfillment and other changes in our business over time when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and replenishment and fulfillment infrastructure to improve guest experiences across multiple channels improve the speed accuracy and costefficiency of our supply chain and inventory management systems and support our current and expected sales levels the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores and might not provide the anticipated benefits 

pursuing the wrong investment opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable or misjudging our replenishment and fulfillment capacity needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 





a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests 

we rely extensively on computer systems throughout our business we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems an increase in remote working arrangements by our team members vendors and other third parties which was accelerated by the covid19 pandemic has amplified our already extensive reliance on computer systems and on our continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use those systems as well as the risks related to that reliance our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches catastrophic events and implementation errors if our systems are damaged disrupted or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experiences and guest confidence for example in the past we have experienced disruptions in our pointofsale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transactions negatively impacted some guests’ experiences and generated negative publicity 

information security cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

if our efforts to provide information security cybersecurity and data privacy are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation and results of operations could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security cybersecurity and data privacy unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors 

the increase in remote working arrangements by our team members vendors and other third parties also increases the risk of a data security compromise and the possible attack surfaces although we conduct training as part of our information security cybersecurity and data privacy efforts that training cannot be completely effective in preventing those attacks from being successful 

our only significant data security incident was a data breach that occurred in 2013 and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents since that data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations based on the prominence and notoriety of our prior significant data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information stop using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether which could adversely affect our reputation sales and results of operations 

the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and data privacy is dynamic increasingly demanding and has enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data complying with current or contemplated data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs require changes to our business practices limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 





supply chain and thirdparty risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax or trade policy interruptions in our operations or supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors including common carriers to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our supply chain operating our replenishment and fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments or if common carriers have difficulty providing capacity to meet demands for their services like they experienced at times during 2020 and 2021 we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the us with china as our single largest source any major changes in tax or trade policy such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products between the us and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity which could adversely affect our reputation sales and our results of operations 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses such as the covid19 pandemic labor shortages labor unrest and activism transport capacity and costs inflation port security weather conditions natural disasters armed conflicts or other events that could alter or suspend our operations slow or disrupt port activities or affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic closings and ship diversions labor disputes and congestion disrupting us ports including those in california where we receive a significant portion of the products we source from outside the us in addition some vendors have had difficulty supplying us products in the quantities we seek the combination of port disruptions the covid19 pandemic and other events in our supply chain have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of events recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations 

if services we obtain from third parties are unavailable disrupted or fail to meet our standards and expectations our operations could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platforms our replenishment and fulfillment operations store and supply chain infrastructure construction and remodel program credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our redcard program infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected 





legal regulatory global and other external risks 

the ongoing and evolving covid19 pandemic may continue to amplify the risks and uncertainties facing our business and their potential impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve with pockets of resurgence and the emergence of variant strains contributing to continued uncertainty about its duration severity and lasting impact governments have taken various measures in response to covid19 including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings in addition we have incurred significant expenses related to efforts to protect the health and wellbeing of our guests and team members nearly all of our stores digital channels and distribution centers have remained open during the covid19 pandemic though at times we have had to temporarily alter other parts of our operations including adjusting our instore returns process suspending physical inventory counts at our stores metering guest traffic reducing store hours and in some locations restricting access to “nonessential” sections of our stores due to emergency operating restrictions those temporary alterations to our operations have at times adversely affected and could again in the future either alone or with any negative guest or team member perceptions about the cleanliness and safety of our stores adversely affect the guest experience sales and our results of operations 

different covid19 vaccines and boosters have been developed and are being distributed as additional covid19 response measures in certain jurisdictions we are subject to vaccine mandates that apply to our team members guests andor others who are in our stores and other buildings we may be subject to similar or additional measures as the covid19 pandemic continues our implementation of these mandates and any requirements for showing compliance with them may result in team member dissatisfaction or unrest attrition of existing team members difficulty in attracting new team members inefficiencies related to team member turnover increased costs related to ongoing compliance scheduling disruptions and negative guest perceptions or experiences which could adversely affect our reputation sales and results of operations 

the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial position and results of operations will depend on future developments many of which are outside of our control including the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic the emergence of variant strains the availability adoption and effectiveness of the covid19 vaccines and covid19 testing and government actions which are uncertain and cannot be predicted the fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and financial performance which could be material 

our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the us 

nearly all of our sales are in the us making our results highly dependent on the health of the us economy and us consumer confidence which can be affected by a variety of factors including housing prices unemployment rates and inflation a deterioration in us macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence the likelihood of which is made more uncertain by the unknown duration severity and lasting impact of the covid19 pandemic and recent increases in the inflation rate could adversely affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 

such a deterioration could adversely affect additional areas of our business such as asset impairment evaluations and the amount of credit card profitsharing revenue payments we receive under our credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards we could also receive lower profitsharing payments if changes in consumer preferences regarding use of revolving credit cards adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances andor the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances 





uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions natural disasters and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions including the impacts of climate change can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition three of our largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers facilities or key vendors in addition weather conditions natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as the covid19 pandemic in areas where we or our vendors have operations could adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests affect consumer purchasing power or reduce consumer demand which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 400000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market our ability to meet those labor needs could be further strained by expanded laws regulations and mandates adopted in connection with the covid19 pandemic if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts and activism which could negatively impact how we are perceived by team members and our overall reputation if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs how we operate our business and our results of operations in addition to our united states operations we have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns and meet evolving expectations for reporting on esg matters could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination and product defects could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors including any third parties selling through our digital channels must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have a social compliance audit process that performs audits regularly but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity the risk of our standards not being met may increase expectations from shareholders guests team members and other third parties concerning esg reporting have increased and our ability to meet those expectations is dependent on a variety of factors including cooperation from sourcing vendors and other third parties and having access to consistent and reliable data negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and the sufficiency and transparency of our reporting on esg matters and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 





our failure to comply with applicable laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 

our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by law changes or adverse judicial developments involving an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements health care or other mandates the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees and the classification of workers as either employees or independent contractors particularly as it applies to our shipt subsidiary a technology company that connects shipt members through its online marketplace with a network of independent contractors who select purchase and deliver groceries and household essentials ordered from target and other retailers the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors in particular is an area that is experiencing legal challenges and legislative changes if our shipt subsidiary is required to treat its independent contractor network as employees it could result in higher compensation and benefit costs 

changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting information security cybersecurity and data privacy product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency environmental protection waste management climate change or other esg matters among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

increases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

several factors influence our effective income tax rate including tax laws and regulations the related interpretations and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition changes in our operations both in and outside of the us may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capitalallocation effectiveness over time for the trailing twelve months ended january 29 2022 aftertax roic was 331 percent compared with 235 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2021 the calculation of roic is provided on page 26  





covid19 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve in 2020 and 2021 governments took various measures in response to covid19 such as mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings to date virtually all of our stores digital channels and distribution centers have remained open 

since the onset of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our sales category and channel mix 

supply chain disruptions 

in recent months we have seen increasing supply chain disruptions in addition to country of origin production delays trucker and dockworker shortages a broadbased surge in consumer demand and other factors have led to industrywide us port and ground transportation delays in response we have taken various actions including ordering merchandise earlier securing ocean freight routes and increased use of air transport for certain merchandise some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions have resulted in increased costs the gross margin rate analysis on page 22 provides additional information 

sale of dermstore 

in february 2021 we sold dermstore llc dermstore for 356 million in cash and recognized a 335 million pretax gain which is included in net other income  expense dermstore represented less than 1 percent of our consolidated revenues operating income and net assets 

analysis of results of operations 





note gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin sales less cost of sales divided by sales all other rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue 

a discussion regarding results of operations and analysis of financial condition for 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in part ii  item 7  mda to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 30 2021 





sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and our estimate of gift card breakage note 4 to the financial statements defines gift card breakage we use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales including shipment from stores to guests store order pickup or drive up and delivery via shipt digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers our vendors or other third parties 

sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our longterm profitability we expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth we believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment price convenience guest experience and other factors will over the longterm drive both increasing shopping frequency number of transactions or traffic and the amount spent each visit average transaction amount 









note sales fulfilled by stores include instore purchases and digitally originated sales fulfilled by shipping merchandise from stores to guests order pickup drive up and shipt 







note 4 to the financial statements provides additional product category sales information the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

td bank group offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards™ we monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a redcard at target redcard sales increased for all years presented below however redcard penetration declined as total sales increased at a faster pace

gross margin rate 

our gross margin rate was 283 percent in 2021 and 284 percent in 2020 this decrease reflected the net impact of 

• supply chain pressure related to increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers partially offset by the small net benefit of a higher percentage of digital sales fulfilled through our lowercost sameday fulfillment options 

• higher merchandise and freight costs partially offset by historically low promotional and clearance markdown rates and 

• favorable mix in the relative growth rates of higher and lower margin categories 

selling general and administrative sga expense rate 

our sga expense rate was 186 percent in 2021 compared with 199 percent in 2020 reflecting the leverage benefit from strong revenue growth 





store data

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense was 421 million for 2021 compared with 977 million for 2020 which included a 512 million loss on early debt retirement 

net other income  expense 

net other income  expense was 382 million and 16 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively 2021 included the 335 million gain on the february 2021 sale of dermstore 

provision for income taxes 

our 2021 effective income tax rate was 220 percent compared with 212 percent in 2020 the rate increase was driven by significantly higher pretax earnings which diluted the taxrate benefit of fixed and discrete tax items 

note 19 to the financial statements provides additional information 





reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies

c represents benefits from the resolution of certain income tax matters unrelated to current period operations 





earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes ebit and earnings from continuing operations before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda are nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures debt levels and for ebitda capital investment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap the most comparable gaap measure is net earnings from continuing operations ebit and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate ebit and ebitda differently limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparisons with other companies 



a represents total depreciation and amortization including amounts classified within depreciation and amortization and within cost of sales 





we have also disclosed aftertax roic which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of the addback of operating lease interest to operating income we believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 







a represents the addback to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within sga expenses operating lease interest is added back to operating income in the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals 

our yearend cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 59 billion from 85 billion in 2020 our cash and cash equivalents balance includes shortterm investments of 50 billion and 76 billion as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

operating cash flows 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 86 billion in 2021 compared with 105 billion in 2020 for 2021 operating cash flows reflect stronger operating results offset by increased inventory investment and lower accounts payable leverage compared with 2020 additionally operating cash flows for 2021 reflect a 10 billion increase in income tax payments 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 139 billion compared with 107 billion in 2020 the increase in inventory levels reflect our efforts to align inventory with sales trends and elevated intransit inventory related to import supply chain delays 





capital expenditures 

note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

capital expenditures increased in 2021 from the prior year as we invested in our strategic initiatives including store remodels some of which were delayed in 2020 new store openings and supply chain projects beyond fullstore remodels we invested in optimizing frontend space in highvolume locations to increase the efficiency of our sameday services and builtout about 100 ulta beauty shopinshops we have completed over 900 fullstore remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017 including 145 in 2021 

in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2021 2020 and 2019 with total future minimum lease payments of 401 million 764 million and 669 million respectively and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of 226 million 442 million and 185 million respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately 40 billion to 50 billion to support remodels new stores and supply chain projects supply chain projects will add replenishment capacity and modernize our network including the use of sortation centers to enhance our lastmile delivery capabilities we expect to complete approximately 200 fullstore remodels open 25 to 30 new stores and add more than 250 ulta beauty shopinshops during 2022 additionally we will continue to invest in optimizing frontend space we also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 15 billion 316 per share in 2021 and 13 billion 268 per share in 2020 a per share increase of 179 percent we declared dividends totaling 17 billion 338 per share in 2021 and 14 billion 270 per share in 2020 a per share increase of 252 percent we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

share repurchases 

during 2021 and 2020 we returned 72 billion and 609 million respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii  item 5  market for the registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form 10k and note 21 to the financial statements for more information 





subsequent to yearend we entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement to repurchase up to 275 billion of our common stock under the agreement we paid 275 billion and received an initial delivery of 89 million shares subject to a final settlement of cash or additional shares in the second quarter of 2022 

financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of january 29 2022 our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above fitch raised our longterm debt rating from a to a during 2021 

in 2021 we issued 20 billion of debt and we repaid 11 billion of debt at maturity 

in 2021 we obtained a committed 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in october 2026 this new facility replaced our 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in october 2023 no balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2021 or 2020 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally as of january 29 2022 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

note 16 to the financial statements provides additional information 

future cash requirements 

we enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments such obligations include but are not limited to purchase commitments debt service leasing arrangements and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 

we believe our sources of liquidity namely operating cash flows credit facility capacity and access to capital markets will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations working capital and capital expenditure requirements finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future 





critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  risk committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the lastin firstout method lifo our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality among other factors we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 139 billion and 107 billion as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively and is further described in note 10 to the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors including purchase volumes sales volumes and our pricing and promotion strategies 

we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 518 million and 504 million as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively vendor income is described further in note 6 to the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed primarily at the store level an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals obtaining valuations from thirdparty brokers or using other valuation techniques we recorded impairments of 87 million 62 million and 23 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively which are described further in note 12 to the financial statements 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 519 million and 510 million as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our selfinsurance expense by 26 million in 2021 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to part ii  item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 





income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 138 million and 193 million as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 19 to the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age length of service andor compensation the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate compensation growth rates mortality and retirement age these assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2021 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 580 percent was determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a 1 percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 41 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 62 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 24 to the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 15 to the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 





forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or similar words the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the funding of debt maturities the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension plan the expected return on plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for claims litigation and the resolution of tax matters our expectations regarding our contractual obligations liabilities and vendor income the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition the expected impact of changes in information technology systems future responses to and effects of the covid19 pandemic and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in part i  item 1a  risk factors to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as of january 29 2022 our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and shortterm investments some of which are at a london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate shortterm investments as of january 29 2022 our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 35 billion based on our balance sheet position as of january 29 2022 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would increase our earnings before income taxes by 3 million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments for example our shortterm investments as of january 29 2022 exceeded our floating rate debt due to operating cash flow acceleration driven by strong operating results see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 16 and 17 to the financial statements 

the united kingdoms financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out libor by june 2023 we do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statements liquidity or access to capital markets 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position as of january 29 2022 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point increasedecrease in interest rates would increasedecrease earnings before income taxes by 6 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 62 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and derivative instruments in our pension plan trust as of january 29 2022 we had hedged 70 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities 





as more fully described in note 23 to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our shareholders guests team members and vendors choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving those different constituencies and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation our reputation is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate target’s position or perceived lack of position on social environmental public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts governmental investigations or litigation in addition vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs may affect our reputation negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels and the value of our promotions are among the factors that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

our owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 





the retail industrys continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools consumers may also use thirdparty channels or devices such as voice assistants and smart home devices to initiate shopping searches and place orders which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures by vendors in managing their own channels content and technology systems to support these efforts could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests across multiple channels our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile social media voice assistants and smart home devices among others our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and from our vendors we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offerings providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times lowcost or free shipping and desired payment methods even when we are successful in meeting expectations for fulfillment if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and others if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict and quickly respond to changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our results of operations 

investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our store remodel program is large and is being implemented using a custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and selective acquisitions to improve guest experiences across multiple channels and improve the speed accuracy and cost efficiency of our supply chain and inventory management systems the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments the value received from those investments may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition 





pursuing the wrong investment opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs or failing to effectively incorporate acquired businesses into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests 

we rely extensively on computer systems throughout our business we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches catastrophic events and implementation errors if our systems are damaged disrupted or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence for example in the past we have experienced disruptions in our pointofsale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transactions negatively impacted some guests’ experiences and generated negative publicity 

information security cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

if our efforts to provide information security cybersecurity and data privacy are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation and results of operations could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security cybersecurity and data privacy unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors 

prior to 2013 all data security incidents we encountered were insignificant our 2013 data breach was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have had data security incidents since the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether which could adversely affect our reputation sales and results of operations 

the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding and has enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data complying with data protection requirements such as those imposed by a variety of state laws may cause us to incur substantial costs require changes to our business practices limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 





supply chain and thirdparty risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax or trade policy interruptions in our operations or supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors including common carriers to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our entire supply chain operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments or if common carriers have difficulty providing capacity to meet demands for their services like they experienced at times during 2020 we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the us with china as our single largest source any major changes in tax or trade policy such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products between the us and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity which could adversely affect our reputation sales and our results of operations 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses such as the covid19 pandemic labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could alter or suspend our operations slow or disrupt port activities or affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the us ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected for example if our guests unfavorably view cvs’s operations our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

the covid19 pandemic has affected our business in many different ways and may continue to amplify the risks and uncertainties facing our business and their potential impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected us consumer shopping patterns and caused the overall health of the us economy to deteriorate in 2020 our sales growth was most pronounced in lower margin categories with an increased percentage originated through our digital channels while some of the changes in guest shopping patterns in connection with the covid19 pandemic may be temporary others could become longlasting if the shifts in our category sales mix to lowermargin merchandise and fulfilling a significantly larger percentage of our sales through digital channels become longlasting and we are unable to offset the lower margin and increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected 





shifts in shopping patterns during the covid19 pandemic have also significantly affected our inventory position and disrupted our supply chain at times we have been unable to procure certain merchandise items in the quantities our guests seek including those most in demand due to the covid19 pandemic if we have additional times where we are unable to restock those products for an extended period it may lead to lost sales and negatively affect our results of operations for other products with demand below historic levels many of which are in highermargin categories such as apparel and accessories we took actions to help manage that inventory such as slowing or cancelling purchase orders and paying related cancellation fees asking vendors to store excess inventory on their premises and accelerating markdowns of inventory those increased costs along with lost sales for those highermargin products have at times negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our profitability our vendors have been and may be affected by the covid19 pandemic in differing ways some financially distressed vendors may be unable to survive the covid19 pandemic which would require us to seek alternative vendors while others are having difficulty supplying us products in the quantities our guests seek which could negatively affect our results of operations 

nearly all of our stores digital channels and distribution centers have remained open during the covid19 pandemic we have incurred significant sga expenses related to efforts to protect the health and wellbeing of our guests and team members most of our headquarters operations have transitioned to remote working arrangements which has amplified our already extensive reliance on computer systems and on our continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use those systems during parts of the covid19 pandemic we have had to temporarily alter other parts of our operations including adjusting our instore returns process suspending physical inventory counts at our stores metering guest traffic reducing store hours and in some locations restricting access to “nonessential” sections of our stores due to emergency state or local operating restrictions those temporary alterations to our operations have at times negatively affected and in the future could negatively affect the guest experience sales and our results of operations in addition if guests or team members have negative perceptions about the cleanliness and safety of our stores in light of the covid19 pandemic our reputation the guest experience sales and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

during the covid19 pandemic some of our competitors were forced to temporarily suspend or limit their operations in addition many guests significantly reduced their spending on dining travel lodging and other leisure activities outside their homes both of those factors may have contributed to our increased sales during the covid19 pandemic as our competitors return to full operations and guests return to spending on those other categories it could lead to lower sales than we experienced during the covid19 pandemic which could negatively affect our results of operations 

a continued and prolonged deterioration in the health in the us economy could lead to a reduction in our sales in the future which could magnify any negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations and negatively and materially affect additional areas of our business such as asset impairment evaluations and the amount of credit card profitsharing revenue payments we receive from td bank group td 

the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial position and results of operations may not be known for an extended period and will depend on future developments many of which are outside of our control including the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic the availability and effectiveness of the covid19 vaccines and related actions taken by the us state local and international governments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted if the covid19 pandemic continues without improvement or worsens its impacts could be more prolonged and may become more severe the fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and financial performance which could be material 

our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the us 

nearly all of our sales are in the us making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 





these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program we share in the profits generated by the credit card program with td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or changes in consumer preferences concerning our credit card program could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profitsharing payments 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions natural disasters and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition three of our largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers facilities or key vendors in addition natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as the covid19 pandemic in areas where we or our vendors have operations could cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests affect consumer purchasing power or reduce consumer demand which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 350000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business in addition to our united states operations we have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination and product defects could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors including any third parties selling through our digital channels must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have a social compliance audit process that perform audits on a regular basis but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity the risk of our standards not being met may increase negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 





our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 

our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by law changes or adverse judicial developments involving an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements health care mandates the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees and the classification of workers as either employees or independent contractors particularly as it applies to our shipt subsidiary a technology company that connects shipt members through its online marketplace with a network of independent contractors who select purchase and deliver groceries and household essentials ordered from target and other retailers the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors in particular is an area that is experiencing legal challenges and legislative changes if our shipt subsidiary is required to treat its independent contractor network as employees it could result in higher compensation and benefit costs 

changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting information security cybersecurity and data privacy product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

increases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law and related regulations tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the us may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

note amounts may not foot due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps a nongaap metric excludes the impact of certain items management believes that adjusted eps is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 23  

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capitalallocation effectiveness over time for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2021 aftertax roic was 235 percent compared with 160 percent for the trailing twelve months ended february 1 2020 the calculation of roic is provided on page 24  

covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus disease covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency the rapid development and fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and financial performance which has been and could continue to be material states and local governments have taken various measures in response to covid19 including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings we have implemented numerous safety measures to protect our guests and team members — such as mandating face masks for all team members and guests in our stores more rigorous cleaning processes providing disposable face masks gloves and thermometers for team members installing distancing markers at stores limiting guest levels within our stores and installing partitions at all stores to date virtually all of our stores digital channels and distribution centers have remained open 

as the pandemic has evolved we have experienced unusually strong sales as guests rely on target for essential items like food medicine cleaning products and household stockup items as well as merchandise associated with guests spending more time at home underlying this trend we saw significant volatility in our sales mix including both category and channel sales mix and sameday fulfillment options 

• during the first quarter comparable sales increased 108 percent reflecting a 09 percent increase in store originated comparable sales and a 141 percent increase in digitally originated comparable sales the quarter began with strength across our multicategory portfolio followed by a shift to strong comparable sales growth in our food  beverage and beauty  household essentials core merchandising categories and significant comparable sales declines in apparel  accessories comparable sales in apparel  accessories recovered notably beginning midapril 

• during the second through fourth quarters comparable sales increased 217 percent reflecting store originated comparable sales growth of 91 percent and an increase in digitally originated comparable sales of 146 percent comparable sales growth was strong across our multicategory portfolio with slightly higher growth in lowermargin categories 

for the year ended january 30 2021 gross margin was negatively impacted by changes in both our category and channel sales mix additionally gross margin reflects the portion of investments in pay and benefits classified within cost of sales exceptionally low clearance and promotional markdown rates partially offset these pressures 

our sga expenses include significant incremental costs related to investments in pay and benefits for store team members the spikes in merchandise volume in stores and the supply chain incremental safety and cleaning supplies and the impact of additional team member hours dedicated to more rigorous cleaning routines in our facilities from an sga expense rate perspective these incremental costs were more than offset by cost leverage resulting from exceptionally strong sales growth 

to support our team and minimize potential disruptions in their work to serve our guests we modified our plans for some of our strategic initiatives including our previously announced remodel program we completed 132 remodels 





in 2020 down from the previous expectation of approximately 300 similarly we opened 29 new small format stores in 2020 rather than the 36 previously announced 

during the first quarter 2020 we issued 25 billion of 5year and 10year notes in an effort to increase our cash on hand additionally we entered into a 900 million 364day credit facility increasing our total undrawn committed credit facilities to 34 billion our operating performance during the second and third quarters of 2020 and financial position allowed us to repurchase 177 billion of debt before its maturity at a market value of 225 billion in october 2020 and terminate the 364day credit facility in november 2020 note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section provide additional information 

sale of dermstore 

in february 2021 we sold dermstore llc dermstore for approximately 350 million subject to working capital and other closing adjustments we expect to recognize a pretax gain in excess of 300 million in the first quarter of 2021 dermstore represented less than 1 percent of our consolidated revenues operating income and net assets 

analysis of results of operations 





note gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin sales less cost of sales divided by sales all other rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue 

a discussion regarding results of operations and analysis of financial condition for the year ended february 1 2020 as compared to the year ended february 2 2019 is included in part ii  item 7  mda to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 1 2020 





sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and our estimate of gift card breakage note 3 to the financial statements defines gift card breakage we use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales including shipment from stores to guests store order pickup or drive up and delivery via shipt digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers our vendors or other third parties 

sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our longterm profitability we expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth we believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment price convenience guest experience and other factors will over the longterm drive both increasing shopping frequency traffic and the amount spent each visit average transaction amount 

the increase in 2020 sales compared to 2019 is due to a 193 percent comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores the covid19 pandemic has affected the amount and mix of sales across channels and categories 





note amounts may not foot due to rounding 









note 3 to the financial statements provides additional product category sales information the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

td bank group offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards™ we monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a redcard at target redcard sales increased for all years presented below however redcard penetration declined as total sales increased at a faster pace 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

our gross margin rate was 284 percent in 2020 and 289 percent in 2019 this decrease reflected increased digital fulfillment and supply chain costs stemming from unusually strong growth in digital volume combined with the impact of higher pay and benefit costs classified within cost of sales and the impact of category sales mix as sales growth was strongest in lowermargin categories the decrease was partially offset by the net impact of merchandising actions most notably the benefit of exceptionally low clearance and promotional markdown rates 





selling general and administrative sga expense rate 

our sga expense rate was 199 percent in 2020 and 208 percent in 2019 incremental team member pay and benefits and investments to protect the health and safety of guests represented approximately 15 billion of the 24 billion increase in sga expenses for the year ended january 30 2021 compared with the prioryear periods from a rate perspective these increased costs were more than offset by leverage resulting from strong revenue growth 

store data 





a in thousands reflects total square feet less office distribution center and vacant space 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 977 million and 477 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase was primarily due to a 512 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2020 

provision for income taxes 

our 2020 effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 212 percent compared with 220 percent in 2019 the effective tax rate for 2020 reflects a larger rate benefit from discrete items primarily related to sharebased payments and resolution of certain income tax matters partially offset by the rate impact of higher earnings compared with the prior year 

note 19 to the financial statements provides additional information 





reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

a represents a loss on our investment in casper sleep inc casper which is not core to our continuing operations 

b represents discrete items related to the tax act refer to note 19 to the financial statements 

c for 2020 includes store damage and inventory losses related to civil unrest net of insurance recoveries for 2019 represents insurance recoveries related to the 2013 data breach 

d represents benefits from the resolution of certain income tax matters unrelated to current period operations 

earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes ebit and earnings from continuing operations before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda are nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures debt levels and for ebitda capital investment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap the most comparable gaap measure is net earnings from continuing operations ebit and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate ebit and ebitda differently limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparisons with other companies 



a represents total depreciation and amortization including amounts classified within depreciation and amortization and within cost of sales 





we have also disclosed aftertax roic which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of the addback of operating lease interest to operating income we believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 







a represents the addback to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within sga expenses operating lease interest is added back to operating income in the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors 

b calculated using the effective tax rates for continuing operations which were 212 percent and 220 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 includes tax effect of 14 billion and 10 billion respectively related to ebit and 18 million and 19 million respectively related to operating lease interest

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals 

in response to covid19 we suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020 in november 2020 we lifted the share repurchase suspension and in february 2021 began repurchasing shares we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance increased to 85 billion from 26 billion in 2019 our cash and cash equivalents balance includes shortterm investments of 76 billion and 18 billion as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

operating cash flows 

operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 105 billion in 2020 compared with 71 billion in 2019 the increase reflects stronger operating performance combined with higher payables leverage during 2020 due to increased inventory turnover driven by strong sales compared with 2019 additionally operating cash flows for 2020 reflect increased payrollrelated liabilities including the deferral of employer social security tax payments and higher incentive compensation 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 107 billion compared with 90 billion in 2019 inventory levels were higher as of january 30 2021 compared with february 1 2020 reflecting efforts to align inventory with sales trends 





capital expenditures 

capital expenditures decreased in 2020 from the prior year as we modified plans for some of our strategic initiatives including store remodels and new store openings as a result of covid19 we have completed over 800 remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017 including 132 in 2020 we expect to complete 150 fullstore remodels and open 30 to 40 new stores during 2021 

in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2020 2019 and 2018 with total future minimum lease payments of 764 million 669 million and 473 million respectively and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of 442 million 185 million and 11 million respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in 2021 of approximately 40 billion to support remodels new stores and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network including sortation centers beyond fullstore remodels we will invest in optimizing frontend space in our highestvolume locations increasing the efficiency of our pickup and drive up services as well as the buildout of ulta beauty shopinshops we also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 13 billion 268 per share in 2020 and 13 billion 260 per share in 2019 a per share increase of 31 percent we declared dividends totaling 14 billion 270 per share in 2020 and 13 billion 262 per share in 2019 a per share increase of 31 percent we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

share repurchases 

during 2020 and 2019 we returned 609 million and 15 billion respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii  item 5  market for the registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form 10k and note 21 to the financial statements for more information 





financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of january 30 2021 our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above 

in 2020 we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds in 2019 we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 

we have additional liquidity through a committed 25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks which expires in october 2023 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2020 or 2019 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally as of january 30 2021 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

note 16 to the financial statements provides additional information 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the lastin firstout method lifo our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality among other factors we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 107 billion and 90 billion as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively and is further described in note 9 to the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors including purchase volumes sales volumes and our pricing and promotion strategies 





we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 504 million and 464 million as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively vendor income is described further in note 5 to the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed primarily at the store level an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals obtaining valuations from thirdparty brokers or using other valuation techniques we recorded impairments of 62 million 23 million and 92 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively which are described further in note 1 1 to the financial statements 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 510 million and 465 million as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our selfinsurance expense by 25 million in 2020 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to part ii  item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 193 million and 188 million as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 19 to the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age length of service andor compensation the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate compensation growth rates mortality and retirement age these assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2020 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 610 percent was determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a 1 percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 40 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 





our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 59 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 24 to the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 15 to the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or similar words the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the funding of debt maturities the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension plan the expected return on plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for claims litigation and the resolution of tax matters our expectations regarding our contractual obligations liabilities and vendor income the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition the expected impact of changes in information technology systems future responses to and effects of the covid19 pandemic and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in part i  item 1a  risk factors to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as of january 30 2021 our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate shortterm investments as of january 30 2021 our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 61 billion based on our balance sheet position as of january 30 2021 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would increase our earnings before income taxes by 6 million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments for example our shortterm investments as of january 30 2021 exceeded our floating rate debt due to operating cash flow acceleration driven by strong operating results as well as the temporary suspension of share repurchases and reduced capital expenditures in the uncertain environment see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 16 and 17 to the financial statements 

the united kingdoms financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out libor over the next several years we do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statements liquidity or access to capital markets 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position as of january 30 2021 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 5 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 59 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and derivative instruments in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 65 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities 

as more fully described in note 23 to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests team members and vendors choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate target’s position or perceived lack of position on social environmental public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups or guests while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts governmental investigations or litigation in addition vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs may affect our reputation negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels and the value of our promotions are among the factors that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

our owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 





the retail industrys continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools consumers may also use thirdparty channels or devices such as voice assistants and smart home devices to initiate shopping searches and place orders which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures by vendors in managing their own channels content and technology systems to support these efforts could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests across multiple channels our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile social media voice assistants and smart home devices among others our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and from our vendors we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offerings providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times lowcost or free shipping and desired payment methods even when we are successful in meeting expectations for fulfillment if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our profitability 

investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our store remodel program is larger than historic levels and is being implemented using a custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and selective acquisitions to improve guest experiences across multiple channels and improve the speed accuracy and cost efficiency of our supply chain and inventory management systems the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments the value received from those investments may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition 





pursuing the wrong investment opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs or failing to effectively incorporate acquired businesses into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests 

we rely extensively on computer systems throughout our business we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches catastrophic events and implementation errors if our systems are damaged disrupted or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence for example during the past year we experienced disruptions in our pointofsale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transactions negatively impacted some guests’ experiences and generated negative publicity 

information security cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

if our efforts to provide information security cybersecurity and data privacy are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation and results of operations could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security cybersecurity and data privacy unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors 

prior to 2013 all data security incidents we encountered were insignificant our 2013 data breach was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have had data security incidents since the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether which could adversely affect our reputation sales and results of operations 

the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding and has enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data complying with new data protection requirements such as those imposed by the recently effective california data privacy laws may cause us to incur substantial costs require changes to our business practices limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 





supply chain and thirdparty risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax or trade policy interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our entire supply chain operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the us with china as our single largest source so any major changes in tax or trade policy such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products between the us and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity which could adversely affect our reputation sales and our results of operations 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses such as the recent coronavirus labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the us ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected for example if our guests unfavorably view cvs’s operations our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the us 

nearly all of our sales are in the us making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 

these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program we share in the profits generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or changes in consumer preferences concerning our credit card program could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profitsharing payments 





uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions natural disasters and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers facilities or key vendors in addition natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as the recent coronavirus outbreak in areas where we or our vendors have operations could cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests affect consumer purchasing power or reduce consumer demand which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 300000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business we also have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in those locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination and product defects could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors including any third parties selling through our digital channels must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have a social compliance audit process that perform audits on a regular basis but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity the risk of our standards not being met may increase negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 





our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 

our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by law changes or adverse judicial developments involving an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements health care mandates the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees and the classification of workers as either employees or independent contractors particularly as it applies to our shipt subsidiary a technology company that connects shipt members through its online marketplace with a network of independent contractors who select purchase and deliver groceries and household essentials ordered from target and other retailers the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors in particular is an area that is experiencing legal challenges and legislative changes if our shipt subsidiary is required to treat its independent contractor network as employees it could result in higher compensation and benefit costs 

changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting information security cybersecurity and data privacy product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

increases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law and related regulations tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the us may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

curation at scale

delivering ease and convenience through same day services 

• we have expanded our digital fulfillment capabilities which elevate the shopping experience and give our guests new reasons to choose target during 2019 over 70 of our comparable digital sales growth was driven by sameday fulfillment options order pickup drive up and delivery via our wholly owned subsidiary shipt 

these investments are translating into tangible financial results summarized below

sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and our estimate of gift card breakage note 2 to the financial statements defines gift card breakage we use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales including shipment from stores to guests store order pick up or drive up and delivery via shipt digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers our vendors or other third parties 

sales growth – from both comparable sales and new stores – represents an important driver of our longterm profitability we expect that c omparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth we believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment price convenience guest experience and other factors will over the longterm drive both increasing shopping frequency traffic and the amount spent each visit average transaction amount 

the increase in 2019 sales compared to 2018 is due to a 34 percent comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was  477 million and  461 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was primarily driven by a 10 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2019 

provision for income taxes 

our 2019 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 220 percent from 203 percent in 2018 which included discrete benefits related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax act and the resolution of certain income tax matters unrelated to 2018 operations 

note 18 to the financial statements provides additional information 





reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies

we have also disclosed aftertax roic  which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of the addback of operating lease interest to operating income we believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 





a represents the addback to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within sga expenses operating lease interest is added back to operating income in the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors 

b calculated using the effective tax rates for continuing operations which were 220 percent and 203 percent for the trailing twelve months ended february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively for the trailing twelve months ended february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 includes tax effect of 1026 million and 839 million respectively related to ebit and 19 million and 17 million respectively related to operating lease interest

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance increased to  2577 million from  1556 million in 2018 our cash and cash equivalents balance includes shortterm investments of 1810 million and 769 million as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals 

operating cash flows 

operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was  7099 million in 2019 compared with  5970 million in 2018 the 2019 operating cash flow increase was primarily driven by higher net earnings and a reduction in inventory during 2019 operating cash flow in 2019 also benefited from increased accounts payable due to timing of import inventory purchases which have longer payment terms compared with 2018 

inventory 

yearend inventory was  8992 million compared with  9497 million in 2018 inventory levels were lower as of february 1 2020 compared with february 2 2019 partially due to focused efforts to reduce inventory across multiple categories where we optimized onhand quantities and assortment additionally elevated inventory levels in the prior year reflected intentional investments in toys merchandise 





capital expenditures 

capital expenditures decreased i n 2019 from the prior year primarily due to project savings in our store remodel program and timing of certain planned expenditures we have completed over 700 remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017 and expect to maintain our pace of approximately 300 remodels in 2020 beginning in 2021 we expect to moderate the annual number of remodels to a range of 150 to 200 

in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2019 2018 and 2017 with total future minimum lease payments of 669 million 473 million and 438 million respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in 2020 of approximately 35 billion as we continue the current store remodel program open additional smallformat stores and accelerate investments in our supply chain we also expect to continue to invest in new store leases 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1330 million 260 per share in 2019 and 1335 million 252 per share in 2018 a per share increase of 32 percent we declared dividends totaling 1345 million 262 per share in 2019 and 1347 million  254 per share in 2018 a per share increase of 31 percent we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

share repurchases 

during 2019 and 2018 we returned  1518 million and  2067 million respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii  item 5  market for the registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form 10k and note 20 to the financial statements for more information 





financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of february 1 2020 our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above fitch raised our commercial paper rating from f2 to f1 during 2019 

in march 2019 we issued 10 billion of debt and in june 2019 we repaid 10 billion of debt at maturity in january 2020 we issued 750 million of debt and we redeemed 10 billion of debt before its maturity 

in both 2019 and 2018 we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 

we have additional liquidity through a committed 25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks which expires in october 2023 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2019 and 2018 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally as of february 1 2020 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements provide additional information 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase programs for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 





commitments and contingencies 



a represents principal payments only see note 15 to the financial statements for further information 

b finance and operating lease payments include  118 million and  901 million respectively related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised see note 17 to the financial statements for further information 

c the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees and the projected timing of future retirements 

d real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities 

e estimated tax contingencies of 188 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement see note 18 to the financial statements for further information 

f purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketingrelated contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met 

g real estate obligations include legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced and commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities 

h we have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of february 1 2020 our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 





critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the lastin firstout method lifo our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was  8992 million and  9497 million as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively and is further described in note 8 to the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 

we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was  464 million and  468 million as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively vendor income is described further in note 4 to the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets which is primarily at the store level an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals obtaining valuations from thirdparty brokers or using other valuation techniques we recorded impairments of  23 million  92 million and  91 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively which are described further in note 10 to the financial statements 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 465 million and 423 million as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our selfinsurance expense by 23 million in 2019 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to part ii  item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities 





the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 188 million and 334 million as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 18 to the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate compensation growth rates mortality and retirement age these assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2019 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 630 percent was determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a 1 percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 39 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 61 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 23 to the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 14 to the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201613  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2020 as required we do not expect the standard to materially affect our consolidated net earnings financial position or cash flows 

we do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 





forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or similar words the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the funding of debt maturities the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension plan the expected return on plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for claims litigation and the resolution of tax matters our expectations regarding our contractual obligations liabilities and vendor income the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition the expected impact of changes in information technology systems and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in part i  item 1a  risk factors to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as of february 1 2020 our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate shortterm investments as of february 1 2020 our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 300 million based on our balance sheet position as of february 1 2020 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements 

in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced the intent to phase out libor by the end of 2021 as a result we may amend our contracts that use libor as a benchmark but do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our financial statements liquidity and access to capital markets 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position as of february 1 2020 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 6 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 61 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 60 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities 

as more fully described in note 22 to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate target’s position or perceived lack of position on social environmental public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups or guests while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts governmental investigations or litigation in addition vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs may affect our reputation negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels and the value of our promotions are among the factors that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

our owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the retail industrys continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools consumers may also use thirdparty channels or devices such as voice assistants and smart home devices to initiate shopping searches and place orders which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures by vendors in managing their own channels content and technology systems to support these efforts could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests across multiple channels our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile social media voice assistants and smart home devices among others our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and costeffectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and from our vendors we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offerings providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times lowprice or free shipping and desired payment methods even when we are successful in meeting expectations for fulfillment if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional instore channel with efficiencies costsavings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our profitability 

investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our current store remodel program is larger than historic levels and is being implemented using a custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller nonstandard footprints located in fully developed markets which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more timeconsuming expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and selective acquisitions to improve guest experiences across multiple channels and improve our supply chain and inventory management systems the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments the value received from those investments may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition 

pursuing the wrong investment opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs or failing to effectively incorporate acquired businesses into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service targetbranded credit and debit card accounts and summarize and analyze results we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence 

data security and privacy risks 

if our efforts to provide information security are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation and results of operations could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors 

prior to 2013 all data security incidents we encountered were insignificant our 2013 data breach was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have had data security incidents since the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether which could adversely affect our sales reputation and results of operations 

the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding and has enhanced requirements for handling personal data complying with new data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs require changes to our business practices limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

supply chain and third party risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax or trade policy interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the us with china as our single largest source so any major changes in tax or trade policy such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products could require us to take certain actions such as raising prices on products we sell which could adversely affect our results of operations 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the us ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with third party service providers could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected for example if our guests unfavorably view cvs’s operations our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the us 

nearly all of our sales are in the us making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 

these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program although we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the profits generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or changes in consumer preferences concerning our credit card program could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters could adversely affect our operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 300000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business we also have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in those locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have a social compliance audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by significant legislative changes or other legal developments on workforcerelated issues including an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements and health care mandates changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting data privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

increases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law and related regulations tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the us may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

fiscal 2018  included the following notable items 

 

as described in note 2 to the financial statements certain prioryear amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting accounting standards update asu no 201409— revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu no 201602— leases topic 842 and   asu no 201707— compensation – retirement benefits topic 715 throughout this document to conform to the current year presentation 

sales were 74433 million  for 2018  an increase of 2647 million  or 37 percent  from the prior year due to a comparable sales increase of 50 percent  and the contribution from new stores partially offset by the impact of the extra week in 2017 operating income in 2018  decreased by 114 million  or 27  percent from 2017  to 4110 million  the analysis of results of operations discussion provides more information operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5970 million  for 2018  a decrease of 891 million  or 130 percent from 6861 million  for 2017  refer to the cash flows discussion within the liquidity and capital resources section of mda on page 24 for additional information

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capitalallocation effectiveness over time for the trailing twelve months ended february 2 2019  roic was 147  percent compared with 154  percent for the trailing twelve months ended february 3 2018  excluding the discrete impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act roic was 146 percent  and 136 percent  for the trailing twelve months ended february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 respectively a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 23 

analysis of results of operations 



 



note gross margin rate is calculated as gross margin sales less cost of sales divided by sales all other rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue 

 

sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage note 3  of the financial statements defines gift card breakage comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites our stores fulfill the majority of digital channel sales including through store pick up or drive up and delivery via our wholly owned subsidiary shipt digital channel sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers our vendors or other third parties 

the increase in 2018 sales compared with 2017 is due to a 50 percent  comparable sales increase and the contribution from new stores partially offset by the extra week in 2017 which contributed 1167 million of sales or 16 percent of 2017 sales   the increase in 2017 sales is due to a comparable sales increase of 13 percent  the extra week in 2017 and the contribution from new stores the extra week contributed 17 percentage points of increase over 2016 inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 



note 3  to the financial statements provides sales by product category the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

td bank group td offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on nearly all purchases and free shipping when they use a redcard at target we monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding in 2018 we refined our calculation of redcard penetration the prior period amounts have been updated to conform with the current methodology resulting in an increase of 02 percentage points to the total redcard penetration for 2017 and 2016 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 284 percent in 2018  288 percent in 2017  and 292 percent in 2016  the 2018 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment and supply chain costs the benefit of merchandising strategies including cost savings initiatives and efforts to improve pricing and promotions was partially offset by the impact of our sales mix 

the 2017 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment costs and supply chain costs benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by net investments in pricing and promotions 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

our sga expense rate was 209 percent in 2018  208 percent in 2017  and 202  percent in 2016  the increase in 2018  was primarily due to higher compensation primarily driven by store wages partially offset by cost savings across multiple expense categories 

the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher compensation costs including both bonus expense and store wages partially offset by cost savings primarily driven by efficiency in our technology operations 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales expense rate was 30 percent in 2018  31  percent in 2017  and 29  percent in 2016  the 2018 decrease was primarily due to the rate impact of higher sales the 2017 increase was primarily due to higher accelerated depreciation for planned store remodels partially offset by the rate impact of the 53rd week of sales 

store data 





 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 461 million  653 million  and 991 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively net interest expense for 2017 and 2016 included losses on early retirement of debt of 123 million and 422 million respectively 

provision for income taxes 

our 2018 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 203 percent from 199 percent in 2017  primarily due to lower discrete favorable benefits of the tax act which were 36 million in 2018 compared with 343 million in 2017 and less rate benefit from our global sourcing operations in 2018 compared with 2017 the lower 2018 benefit of discrete tax actrelated items was substantially offset by the fullyear benefit of a 21 percent federal statutory rate in 2018 compared with a 337 percent blended federal statutory rate in 2017 

our 2017 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 199 percent from 327 percent in 2016  driven primarily by the impact of the tax act 

note 19  of the financial statements provides additional information 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

 

earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes ebit and earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures debt levels and for ebitda capital investment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the most comparable gaap measure is net earnings from continuing operations ebit and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate ebit and ebitda differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



 

we have also disclosed aftertax roic which is a ratio based on gaap information we believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 







 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 1556 million  from 2643 million  in 2017  primarily because we repatriated cash previously held by entities located outside the us and deployed it during 2018 in support of our business objectives our cash and cash equivalents balance includes shortterm investments of 769 million and 1906 million as of february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals

operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5970 million  in 2018  compared with 6861 million  in 2017  and 5337 million  in 2016 the 2018 operating cash flow decrease was primarily due to a larger increase in inventory in 2018 compared with 2017 partially offset by lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the tax act 

the 2017 operating cash flow increase was due to increased payables leverage primarily driven by changes in vendor payment terms in 2017 partially offset by an inventory increase in 2017 compared with a decrease during 2016 the operating cash flow increase was also partially due to the payment of approximately 500 million of taxes during 2016 related to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 9497 million  compared with 8597 million  in 2017  we increased inventory in 2018 to support higher sales including market share opportunities in toys and babyrelated merchandise in addition inventory levels were increased to support new brand launches and our efforts to improve instock levels 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures increased in 2018  from the prior year primarily due to increased investments in existing stores as we further accelerated our current store remodel program this investment acceleration follows an increase in 2017 as we accelerated our store remodel program 

in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2018  2017  and 2016  with total future minimum lease payments of 473 million 438 million and 550 million respectively 

we expect capital expenditures in 2019 at a level consistent with 2018 as we continue the current store remodel program open additional smallformat stores and make other investments in our business we also expect to continue our current rate of investment in store leases 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1335 million  252 per share in 2018  and 1338 million  244 per share in 2017  a per share increase of 33 percent we declared dividends totaling 1347 million 254 per share in 2018  a per share increase of 33 percent over 2017  we declared dividends totaling 1356 million  246  per share in 2017  a per share increase of 42 percent over 2016  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

share repurchases 

during 2018 2017 and 2016 we returned 2067 million  1026 million  and 3686 million  respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k and note 21  to the financial statements for more information 

financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of february 2 2019  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above 

in 2018  we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper in 2017  we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds 

we have additional liquidity through a committed 25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october 2018 we extended this credit facility by one year to october 2023 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2018  2017  or 2016  

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at february 2 2019  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

note 16  of the financial statements provides more information about financing activities 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the lastin firstout method our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 9497 million  and 8597 million  at february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively and is further described in note 9  of the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 

we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 468 million  and 416 million at february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively vendor income is described further in note 5  of the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets which is primarily at the store level an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 92 million  91 million  and 43 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively which are described further in note 11  of the financial statements 

we applied the hindsight practical expedient for measurement of lease assets and liabilities and associated leasehold improvement assets in our adoption of asu no 201602— leases topic 842 which required significant judgment to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases in transition to the new standard using hindsight shortened lease terms for many leases operating lease assets and liabilities were 1965 million and 2170 million respectively at february 2 2019 finance lease assets and liabilities were 872 million and 1021 million  respectively at february 2 2019 leases are described further in notes 2  and 18  of the financial statements 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 423 million and 419 million at february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 21 million in 2018  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities 

we recognized the income tax effects of the tax act in our 2018 and 2017 financial statements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provides sec staff guidance for the application of asc topic 740 income taxes note 19  of the financial statements provides additional information 

the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 334 million and 363 million at february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 19  of the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2018  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 630 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a 1 percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 39 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 68 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 24  of the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 15  of the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2  note 3  and note 18  of the financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues leases and pension expense we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income including those resulting from the tax act the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension plan the expected returns on pension plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for investigations inquiries claims and litigation expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition the resolution of tax matters the expected impact of changes in information technology systems and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at february 2 2019  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a london interbank offered rate liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate shortterm investments at february 2 2019  our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate shortterm investments by approximately 700 million based on our balance sheet position at february 2 2019  the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 16  and 17  to the financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position at february 2 2019  the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 6 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 1 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 68 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 60 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in notes 12  and 23  to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in negative mainstream and social media publicity consumer boycotts governmental investigations or litigation in addition vendors and others with whom we choose to do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs may affect our reputation negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and technology development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels the effectiveness of our promotions the attractiveness of our third party offerings such as the clinics and pharmacies owned and operated by cvs and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands which help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights in these brands our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration of retailing to digital channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of factors we must compete by offering a consistent convenient shopping experience and value for our guests regardless of sales channel and by providing our guests and team members with reliable effective and easytouse digital tools any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures by vendors in managing their own channels content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using a variety of electronic devices and platforms to 

shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing new technology software and processes to be able to costeffectively fulfill guest orders directly from our vendors and from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers providing flexible fulfillment options is complex and may not meet guest expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping if we are unable to attract and retain team members contract with third parties or make selective acquisitions to obtain the specialized skills needed to support these efforts collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to support our personalization efforts allow realtime and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill orders using the fulfillment and payment methods guests demand or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests across all sales channels our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other technology systems do not appeal to our guests integrate with our vendors or other third parties reliably function as designed integrate across all sales channels or maintain the privacy of data we may experience a loss of guest confidence and lost sales which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our gross margins and hurting our profitability 

investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our current store remodel program is larger than historic levels and is being implemented using a custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller nonstandard footprints located in fully developed markets which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more timeconsuming expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities and lower than expected sales from those opportunities could adversely impact our results of operations 

our business also relies on investments in technology and selective acquisitions and the returns on these investments can be less predictable than remodeling and building stores we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and selective acquisitions to improve guest experiences across sales channels and improve our supply chain and inventory management systems these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments the value received from those investments may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition 

targeting the wrong investment opportunities failing to successfully meet our strategic objectives when making the correct investments being unable to make new concepts scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs or failing to effectively incorporate acquired businesses into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service targetbranded credit and debit card accounts and summarize and analyze results we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions engage in additional promotional activities to retain our guests and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence 

data security and privacy risks 

if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors 

until the data breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 all incidents we encountered were insignificant the data breach we experienced in 2013 was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors had data security incidents subsequent to the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether 

supply chain and third party risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax policy or trade relations interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source so any major changes in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of additional tariffs 

or duties on imported products could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations changes in trade policy trade restrictions tariffs or duties the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the united states ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs duties currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with third party service providers could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business if we fail to properly manage those third parties if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security then our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs or be limited in finding replacement providers or hiring and retaining team members to provide these services inhouse for example if our guests unfavorably view cvs’s operations or if our relationship with cvs does not meet our strategic objectives our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

virtually all of our sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on united states consumer confidence and the health of the united states economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 

these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program although we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the profits generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters could adversely affect our operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 300000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

we have offices in india and china where there has generally been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india or offices in china could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and integrity of sources of supply we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and sources of supply we have a social compliance audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived social compliance concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by significant legislative changes to workforcerelated issues including an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law and related regulations tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

fiscal 2017  a 53week year included the following notable items 

 

sales were 71879 million  for 2017  an increase of 2384 million  or 34 percent  from the prior year due to a comparable sales increase of 13 percent  the extra week in 2017 and the contribution from new stores earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2017  decreased by 657 million  or 132  percent from 2016  to 4312 million  the analysis of results of operations discussion provides more information operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 6849 million  for 2017 an increase of 1520 million or 285 percent from 5329 million  for 2016 refer to the cash flows discussion within the liquidity and capital resources section of mda on page 25 for additional information 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps a nongaap metric excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 22 

a consisted of 53 weeks 

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capitalallocation effectiveness over time for the trailing twelve months ended february 3 2018  roic was 159  percent compared with 150  percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 28 2017  excluding the discrete impacts of the tax act roic was 140 percent for the trailing twelve months ended february 3 2018  a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 24 

analysis of results of operations 

segment results 



note see note 30  of our financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes and more information about items recorded outside of segment sga 

 



note rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

 

sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage note 2  of the financial statements provides a gift card breakage definition digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our stores our distribution centers our vendors or other delivery options including store driveup and delivery via our wholly own subsidiary shipt 

the increase in 2017 sales is due to a comparable sales increase of 13 percent  the extra week in 2017 and the contribution from new stores the extra week contributed 1167 million of sales or 17 percentage points of increase over 2016 the decrease in 2016 sales compared to 2015 reflects a decrease of approximately 3815 million due to the pharmacy transaction and a 05 percent comparable sales decrease partially offset by the contribution from new stores   inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 



 

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate we removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 





note amounts may not foot due to rounding  



 

the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

td offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a redcard we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note excluding pharmacy and clinic sales total redcard penetration would have been 232 percent for 2015 the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total redcard penetration due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 289 percent in 2017  293 percent in 2016  and 292 percent in 2015  the 2017 decrease was primarily due to increased digital fulfillment costs benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by net investments in pricing and promotions 

the 2016 increase was primarily due to the pharmacy transaction and favorable category sales mix partially offset by increased digital fulfillment costs cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

our sga expense rate was 198 percent in 2017  192 percent in 2016  and 196  percent in 2015  the increase in 2017  was primarily due to higher compensation costs including both bonus expense and store wages partially offset by cost savings primarily driven by efficiency in our technology operations 

the decrease in 2016 primarily resulted from the benefit of the pharmacy transaction and technologyrelated cost savings partially offset by increased stores hourly payroll 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales expense rate was 31 percent in 2017  29  percent in 2016  and 27  percent in 2015  the 2017 increase was primarily due to higher accelerated depreciation for planned store remodels partially offset by the rate impact of the 53rd week of sales the 2016 increase was due to the rate impact of lower sales in 2016 than 2015 

store data 





 

other performance factors 

other selling general and administrative expenses 

we recorded 4 million and 216 million of selling general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2016  and 2015  respectively because they relate to discretely managed matters additional information about these discretely managed items is provided within note 30 of the financial statements 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 666 million  1004 million  and 607 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net interest expense for 2017 and 2016 included losses on early retirement of debt of 123 million and 422 million respectively 

provision for income taxes 

our 2017 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 197 percent from 327 percent in 2016  driven primarily by the impact of the tax act which among other matters reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 

the tax act reduced our 2017 income tax expense by 388 million comprised of the following 

 

 

certain other provisions of the tax act not expected to have a material impact on net income are as follows 

 

 

as described in note 23 of the financial statements certain aspects of our 2017 income tax provision related to the tax act amounts are provisional 

we expect a 2018 effective tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent we expect a corresponding 2018 operating cash flow benefit from the lower rate and to a lesser degree additional operating cash flow benefits from the immediate deductibility provision described above 

our 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 327 percent from 325 percent in 2015  driven primarily by the 2015 rate impact of the 112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward this comparative rate impact was partially offset by 27 million of excess tax benefit in 2016 related to sharedbased payments after the adoption of accounting standards update asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  and lower pretax earnings

see note 7  of the financial statements for information about our canada exit 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

a consisted of 53 weeks 

 

we have presented consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes ebit and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda nongaap financial measures because we believe that these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared to our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures debt levels and for ebitda capital investment these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the most comparable gaap measure is net earnings from continuing operations consolidated ebit and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate consolidated ebit and ebitda differently limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



a    consisted of 53 weeks 

 

we have also disclosed aftertax return on invested capital for continuing operations roic which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases operating leases are capitalized as part of the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure across companies this metric provides a measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently limiting the usefulness of the measure 







 

capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the most comparable gaap measure is total rent expense capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 



our calculation of aftertax roic will change when we adopt asu no 201602 leases in the first quarter of 2018 primarily resulting from replacing calculated operating lease obligations with gaap operating lease obligations and an interest adjustment specific to the lease portfolio we expect these changes to result in an roic decrease of approximately 0205 percentage points for all periods presented refer to note 22 to the financial statements for additional information 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance increased to 2643 million  from 2512 million  in 2016  as of february 3 2018 808 million  of cash and cash equivalents were held at entities located outside the united states there are no substantial taxes or restrictions to repatriate these holdings for domestic use our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals 

operating cash flows 

operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 6849 million  in 2017  compared with 5329 million  in 2016  the operating cash flow increase is due to increased payables leverage primarily driven by changes in vendor payment terms in 2017 partially offset by an inventory increase in 2017 compared to a decrease during 2016 the operating cash flow increase is also partially due to the payment of approximately 500 million of taxes during 2016 related to the pharmacy transaction 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 8657 million  compared with 8309 million  in 2016  we increased inventory in 2017 to support higher sales 

capital expenditures 

a in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2017  2016  and 2015  with total future minimum lease payments of 438 million 550 million and 338 million respectively 

capital expenditures increased in 2017  from the prior year primarily due to increased investments in existing stores as we accelerated our current store remodel program this investment acceleration follows an increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased remodels and guest experience enhancements in 2016 these increases were partially offset by capital expenditure reductions driven by efficiency gains in technology 

we expect capital expenditures in 2018 to increase to approximately 35 billion as we accelerate the rate of store remodels continue our current rate of smallformat store openings and continue to make supply chain investments we also expect to continue our current rate of investment in store leases 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1338 million  244 per share in 2017  and 1348 million  232 per share in 2016  a per share increase of 52 percent we declared dividends totaling 1356 million 246 per share in 2017  a per share increase of 42 percent over 2016  we declared dividends totaling 1359 million  236  per share in 2016  a per share increase of 73 percent over 2015  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

share repurchases 

during 2017 2016 and 2015 we returned 1026 million  3686 million  and 3441 million  respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k and note 25  to the financial statements for more information 

financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of february 3 2018  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above 

in 2017 we transitioned to longer payment terms with many of our suppliers because of these changes we expect less variability in our working capital needs throughout the year as we continue to better match payables to inventory levels in 2017  we funded our holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds in 2016  we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 

we have additional liquidity through a committed 25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october 2016 in october 2017 we extended this credit facility by one year to expire in october 2022 this unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in october 2018 no balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2017  2016  or 2015 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at february 3 2018  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

note 20 of the financial statements provides more information about financing activities 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 8657 million  and 8309 million  at february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively and is further described in note 12  of the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 

we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 416 million  and 385 million at february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively vendor income is described further in note 4  of the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 91 million  43 million  and 54 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively which are described further in note 14  of the financial statements 

goodwill we perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting unit could exist typically we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill during our qualitative assessment we make significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors including product and sga costs overall financial performance of the company changes in our share price and relevant companyspecific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill we perform the first step of the impairment process which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including the goodwill we have not been required to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill in 2017 or 2016 we recorded a 12 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to the wind down of noncore operations 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 419 million and 447 million at february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 21 million in 2017  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities 

we recognized the income tax effects of the tax act in our 2017 financial statements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 which provides sec staff guidance for the application of asc topic 740 income taxes in the reporting period in which the president signed the tax act into law note 23 of the financial statements provides additional information 

the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 363 million and 222 million at february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively 

and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 23  of the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2017  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 655 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 38 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 31 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 28  of the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 19 of the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 note 22 note 28 and note 29 of the financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues leases pension expense and accumulated other comprehensive income respectively we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the expected impact of the pharmacy transaction on our financial performance the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income including those resulting from the tax act the impact of certain tax act provisions on our cash flows the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact and timing of adopting new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension plan the expected returns on pension plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for investigations inquiries claims and litigation expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition the resolution of tax matters and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at february 3 2018  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments at february 3 2018  our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 900 million based on our balance sheet position at february 3 2018  the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 20  and 21  to the financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position at february 3 2018  the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 6 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 31 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in notes 15  and 27  to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in negative mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store and technology development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties in addition vendors and others with whom we choose to do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs may impact our reputation 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our instock levels the effectiveness of our promotions the attractiveness of our third party offerings such as the clinics and pharmacies owned and operated by cvs and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop and support our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights in these brands our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to digital channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel we must provide our guests and team members digital tools that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use failures to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other 

devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing new technology software and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders directly from our vendors and from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers providing flexible fulfillment options is complex and may not meet guest expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support these efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology in a timely manner collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to support our personalization efforts allow realtime and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests across all sales channels our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guest‑facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests reliably function as designed integrate across all sales channels or maintain the privacy of guest data we may experience a loss of guest confidence and lost sales which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise for example our apparel and home décor assortment is continually evolving and in other areas of our product assortment including food we are supporting guest wellness goals and offering more items that appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes failure to obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement effective promotions and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability 

technology investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in technology supply chain new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments and the returns on these investments can be less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to provide a consistent and improved guest experience across all sales channels and improve our supply chain and inventory management systems these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired return or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost our business also depends in part on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller and nonstandard footprints located in fully developed markets which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more timeconsuming expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets targeting the wrong technology or store opportunities failing to make the best investments being unable to make new concepts scalable or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service redcard accounts and summarize and analyze results we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions engage in additional 

promotional activities to retain our guests and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we continually make significant technology investments that are intended to help maintain and update our existing computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence 

data security and privacy risks 

if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests team members and vendors are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer 

we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members and vendors we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors vendors and temporary staff 

until the data breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 all incidents we encountered were insignificant the data breach we experienced in 2013 was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors had data security incidents subsequent to the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether 

supply chain and third party risks 

changes in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax policy or trade relations interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source the results of the recent united states elections may signal a change in trade policy between the united states and other countries because a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states major changes in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income 

political or financial instability currency fluctuations changes in trade policy trade restrictions tariffs or duties the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the united states ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs duties currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an 

adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with third party service providers could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers and aspects of our food offerings if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business if we fail to properly manage those third parties if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security then our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring and retaining team members to provide these services inhouse an example of our reliance on third parties is our relationship with cvs if our guests do not react favorably to cvs’s operations or if our relationship with cvs is ineffective our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition if we wish to have clinics and pharmacies in any new stores those clinics and pharmacies must be owned and operated by cvs which limits our flexibility in designing and operating new stores and new store concepts 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

virtually all of our sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on united states consumer confidence and the health of the united states economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins 

these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program although we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions alone or together with natural disasters could adversely affect our operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and directly to guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 300000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business and regulatory compliance is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other be 

nefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

we maintain a headquarters location in india and sourcing offices in china where there has generally been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india or offices in china could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channels information technology development and sourcing operations 

failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or targets or our guests’ expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and integrity of sources of supply we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities all of our vendors must also comply with our standards of vendor engagement which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and sources of supply we have a social compliance audit process but we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived social compliance concerns could hurt our reputation and result in lost sales for example we recently terminated a relationship with a vendor that supplied us with cotton sheets that were represented to be 100 percent egyptian cotton after we discovered that the vendor substituted nonegyptian cotton if that event or if similar events in the future cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs we could lose sales and it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate significant workforcerelated legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible workforcerelated legislative changes include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

fiscal 2016  included the following notable items 

 sales were 69495 million  for 2016  a decrease of 4290 million  or 58 percent  from the prior year primarily due to the pharmacy transaction earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2016  decreased by 561 million  or 101  percent from 2015  to 4969 million  primarily due to the 2015 gain on the pharmacy transaction operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5329 million  5254 million  and 5157 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively in 2015 proceeds from the pharmacy transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations refer to note 6 of the financial statements for additional information about the transaction 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps a nongaap metric excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 21 

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capitalallocation effectiveness over time for the trailing twelve months ended january 28 2017  roic was 150  percent compared with 160  percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016  excluding the net gain on the pharmacy transaction roic was 139 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016 a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 22 

analysis of results of operations 

segment results 



note see note 30  of our financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes and more information about items recorded outside of segment sga 

 



note rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

 

sales 

sales include all merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2  of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our distribution centers our vendors or our stores 

the decrease in 2016 sales reflects a decrease of approximately 3815 million due to the pharmacy transaction and a comparable sales decrease of 05 percent partially offset by the contribution from new stores the increase in 2015 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 21  percent and the contribution from new stores partially offset by a decrease of approximately 550 million due to the pharmacy transaction   inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 



 

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate we removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 





note amounts may not foot due to rounding  



 

further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores 

td offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at targetcom when they use a redcard we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note excluding pharmacy and clinic sales total redcard penetration would have been 232 percent and 219 percent for 2015 and 2014 respectively the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total redcard penetration due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 297 percent in 2016  295 percent in 2015  and 294 percent in 2014  the 2016 increase was primarily due to the pharmacy transaction and favorable category sales mix partially offset by increased shipping and digital fulfillment costs cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment 

the 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

our sga expense rate was 192 percent in 2016  196 percent in 2015  and 200  percent in 2014  the decrease in 2016  primarily resulted from the benefit of the pharmacy transaction and technologyrelated cost savings partially offset by increased stores hourly payroll 

the decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense partially offset by investments in other initiatives none of which were individually significant 

store data 





 

other performance factors 

other selling general and administrative expenses 

we recorded 4 million 216 million and 174 million of selling general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively because they relate to discretely managed matters additional information about these discretely managed items is provided within note 30 of the financial statements 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 1004 million  607 million  and 882 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively net interest expense for 2016 and 2014 included a loss on early retirement of debt of 422 million and 285 million respectively 

provision for income taxes 

our 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 327 percent from 325 percent in 2015  driven primarily by the 2015 rate impact of the 112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss this comparative rate impact was partially offset by 27 million of excess tax benefit in 2016 related to sharedbased payments after the adoption of accounting standards update asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  and lower pretax earnings note 23  of the financial statements provides a tax rate reconciliation 

our 2015 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 325 percent from 330 percent in 2014  driven primarily by the 112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss this benefit was partially offset by a yearoveryear decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 8 million and 35 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

discontinued operations 

see note 7  of the financial statements for information about our canada exit 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes certain items presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note amounts may not foot due to rounding 

 

we have also disclosed aftertax return on invested capital for continuing operations roic which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases operating leases are capitalized as part of the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors we believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 







 

capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the most comparable gaap measure is total rent expense capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 



analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to 2512 million  from 4046 million  in 2015  primarily reflecting deployment during 2016 of proceeds from the pharmacy transaction and payment of related taxes due to the timing of the sale late in 2015 we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015 shortterm investments of 1110 million and 3008 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016  and 2015  respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

capital allocation 

we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable longterm value and maintain our current operations and assets second we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals 

cash flows 

our 2016  operations were funded by internally and externally generated funds operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5329 million  in 2016  compared with 5254 million  in 2015  these cash flows combined with period yearend cash position allowed us to invest in the business fund early debt retirement and maturities pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program proceeds from the pharmacy transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations during 2015 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 8309 million  compared with 8601 million  in 2015  the decrease was due to our alignment of inventory levels with the slowing sales trend while appropriately supporting instocks 

share repurchases 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we returned 3686 million  3441 million  and 41 million  respectively to shareholders through share repurchase see part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k and note 25  to the financial statements for more information 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1348 million  232 per share in 2016  and 1362 million  216 per share in 2015  a per share increase of 74 percent we declared dividends totaling 1359 million 236 per share in 2016  a per share increase of 73 percent over 2015  we declared dividends totaling 1378 million  220  per share in 2015  a per share increase of 106 percent over 2014  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

shortterm and longterm financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities and manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of january 28 2017  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above 

in 2016  we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper in 2015 we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds 



we have additional liquidity through a committed 25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october 2016 which expires in october 2021 this new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in october 2018 no balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2016  2015  or 2014 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 28 2017  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund debt maturities pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

capital expenditures 

a in addition to these cash investments we entered into leases related to new stores in 2016 2015 and 2014 with total future minimum lease payments of 550 million 338 million and 85 million respectively 

capital expenditures increased in 2016 from the prior year because we increased our investments in existing stores including remodels and guest experience enhancements these increases were partially offset by continued efficiency gains in technology capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer largeformat stores and realized efficiency gains in technology partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments as noted in the footnote to the chart presented above we substantially increased our investments in leases in 2016 and 2015 

we expect capital expenditures in 2017 to increase to approximately 20 billion to 25 billion as we accelerate the rate of store remodels and flexibleformat store openings and continue to make supply chain investments we also expect our rate of investment in store leases to continue to increase 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 8309 million  and 8601 million  at january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively and is further described in note 12  of the financial statements 

vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 

we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of the yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 385 million and 384 million at january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 respectively vendor income is described further in note 4  of the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 43 million  54 million  and 124 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively which are described further in note 14  of the financial statements 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 447 million and 498 million at january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 22 million in 2016  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 222 million and 215 million at january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 23  of the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire age andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2016  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 68 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 37 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our 

benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 30 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 28  of the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 19 of the financial statements for further information on contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at january 28 2017  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments at january 28 2017  our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate shortterm investments by approximately 140 million based on our balance sheet position at january 28 2017  the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate shortterm investments would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 20  and 21  to the financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position at january 28 2017  the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 7 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 30 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in notes 15  and 27  to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks that we face for the convenience of the reader the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply but they may also apply to other categories 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store and technology development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties for example we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of a data breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 more recently the sale of our pharmacy and clinic assets to cvs means that cvs will be operating clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests’ perceptions of and experiences with cvs whether within our stores at independent cvs locations or otherwise may impact our reputation 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality and reliability of our digital channels our instock levels the effectiveness of our promotions the attractiveness of our third party offerings such as the clinics and pharmacies owned and operated by cvs and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies to drive traffic across all sales channels could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights in our owned and exclusive brands our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise offering certain services our guests desire in our stores through third parties such as cvs offering a compelling guest loyalty program and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our pricematch policy failures to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable experience for our guests regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website targetcom offer applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media retailing is rapidly evolving so that the majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing new technology software and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders directly from our vendors and from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers providing flexible fulfillment options is complex and may not meet guest expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support these efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology in a timely manner allow realtime and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests across all sales channels our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guest‑facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests reliably function as designed integrate across all sales channels or maintain the privacy of guest data or if we are unable consistently meet our guests expectations we may experience a loss of guest confidence and lost sales which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home décor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise for example our apparel and home décor assortment is continually evolving and in other areas of our product assortment including food we are supporting guest wellness goals and becoming more localized with items that appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes failure to obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement effective promotions and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability 

technology investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in technology supply chain new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments and the returns on these investments can be less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to support our efforts to provide a consistent guest experience across all sales channels implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology and evolve our supply chain and our inventory management systems information processes and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace which depends on our ability to accurately forecast our needs and is influenced by the amount and pace of investments by our competitors in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller and nonstandard footprints located in fully developed markets which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more timeconsuming expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service redcard accounts summarize and analyze results and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions engage in additional promotional activities to retain our guests and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence 

data security and privacy risks 

if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests team members and vendors are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer 

an important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests team members and vendors we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors vendors and temporary staff 

until the data breach in the fourth quarter of 2013 all incidents we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced in 2013 was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents subsequent to the 2013 data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether 

supply chain and third party risks 

interruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network increased commodity supply chain and fulfillment costs or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner as we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability currency fluctuations trade restrictions the outbreak 

of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the us ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur or worsen it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations 

a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including portions of our technology development and systems our digital platforms and distribution network operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers and aspects of our food offerings if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security then our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services inhouse if our guests do not react favorably to cvs’s operations or if our relationship with cvs is ineffective our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition if we wish to have clinics and pharmacies in any new stores those clinics and pharmacies must be owned and operated by cvs 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

virtually all of our sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and directly to guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of target team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 341000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business and regulatory compliance is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

we maintain a headquarters location in india where there has generally been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital sales channels and information technology development 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and children’s products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate significant workforcerelated legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible workforcerelated legislative changes include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

fiscal 2015 included the following notable items 

 sales were 73785 million  for 2015  an increase of 1167 million  or 16  percent from the prior year earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2015  increased by 995 million  or 220  percent from 2014  to 5530 million  operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5140 million  5131 million  and 7519 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations in 2013 operating cash flow provided by continuing operations includes 27 billion of proceeds from the sale of our us credit card receivables 



note adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps a nongaap metric excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued canadian operations management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 23 

we report aftertax return on invested capital roic from continuing operations as we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016  roic was 160  percent compared with 124  percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 31 2015  excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses roic was 139 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016 a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 24 

pharmacies and clinics transaction 

in december 2015 we closed the previously announced sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs for cash consideration of 19 billion cvs now operates the pharmacy and clinic businesses in our stores under a perpetual operating agreement subject to termination in limited circumstances no profitsharing arrangement exists but cvs will make an annual inflationadjusted occupancyrelated payment to us starting at 20 million to 25 million in the first year of the agreement we also entered into a development agreement with cvs through which we may jointly develop smallformat stores 

in connection with the sale we recognized a pretax gain of 620 million which we recorded outside of segment results and excluded from adjusted eps we also recorded deferred income of 694 million which we will amortize into income evenly over the 23year weighted average remaining accounting useful life of our stores 

during 2015 we used a portion of the 19 billion cash consideration to repurchase shares of our common stock and settle approximately 200 million of retained pharmacy and clinic net liabilities we expect to use the remaining proceeds to pay approximately 500 million of related taxes and repurchase shares 

had this transaction closed prior to this year our 2015 reported sales and cost of goods sold would have been lower by approximately 38 billion and 31 billion respectively with no notable effect on ebitda or ebit 

this transaction is expected to be accretive to eps in every period following the closing and should add 50 basis points or more to roic over time in addition due to the lower sales base without a significant effect on profits we expect the transaction to have a favorable impact on our ebitda and ebit margin rates 

refer to note 6  of the financial statements for additional information about the transaction 

analysis of results of operations 

segment results 



note effective january 15 2015 we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations excluding net interest expense data breach related costs and certain other expenses which are discretely managed our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital sales channels beginning with the first quarter of 2015 segment ebit includes the impact of the reduction of the beneficial interest asset for comparison purposes prior years segment ebit has been revised see note 30  of our financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

 



note rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2  of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage the increase in 2015 and 2014 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 21  percent and 13  percent respectively and the contribution from new stores partially offset by a decrease in 2015 of approximately 550 million due to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses   inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 



comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than 13 months digital acquisitions operating less than one year stores that have been closed and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate pharmacy and clinic sales for the comparable period following the sale to cvs are excluded from the calculation comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 





note amounts may not foot due to rounding  



 

further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores 

td offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at targetcom when they use a redcard we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note excluding pharmacy and clinic sales total redcard penetration would have been 232 percent 219 percent and 201 percent for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total redcard penetration due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 295 percent in 2015  294 percent in 2014  and 298 percent in 2013  the 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales 

the 2014 decrease was primarily due to promotional activity 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

our sga expense rate was 196 percent in 2015  200 percent in 2014  and 202  percent in 2013  the decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense partially offset by investments in other initiatives none of which were individually significant we will continue to seek efficiency savings to reinvest in our business however we do not expect the sga rate to continue to decline at the pace realized during 2014 and 2015 

the decrease in 2014 was primarily related to cost savings initiatives partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives none of which were individually significant 

store data 





 

other performance factors 

other selling general and administrative expenses 

we recorded 216 million 174 million and 81 million of selling general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 23 and note 30 of the financial statements 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 607 million  882 million  and 1049 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of 285 million and 445 million respectively 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 325 percent in 2015  from 330 percent in 2014  driven primarily by the 112 million tax benefit that resulted from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss related to our canada exit this benefit is recorded in continuing operations as the release of the valuation allowance is attributable to a capital gain generated by the cvs transaction the tax rate benefit from this valuation allowance release was partially offset by a yearoveryear decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 8 million and 35 million in 2015  and 2014  respectively note 23  of the financial statements provides a tax rate reconciliation 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 330 percent in 2014  from 346 percent in 2013  driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 35 million and 16 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

discontinued operations 

on january 15 2015 target canada co and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of target collectively canada subsidiaries comprising substantially all of our former canadian operations and our former canadian segment filed for protection the filing under the companies creditors arrangement act ccaa with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto the court and were deconsolidated as a result we recorded a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges collectively totaling 51 billion the canada subsidiaries are executing a liquidation through the ccaa process 

income from discontinued operations net of tax was 42 million  during 2015 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached settlements with two entities that controlled guaranteed leases representing approximately 46 percent of the recorded accrual at that time under the settlement terms these entities have subrogated to us their claims against the canada subsidiaries the settlement amounts were materially consistent with our previously recorded accruals 

as part of a march 2016 settlement between the canada subsidiaries and all of their former landlords we have agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the estate in exchange for a full release from obligations under guarantees of certain leases this agreement remains subject to creditor and court approval the financial impact of this agreement is materially consistent with amounts recorded in our financial statements 

for more information about our canada exit see note 7  of the financial statements 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes the impact of the 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses the 2013 sale of our us consumer credit card receivables portfolio losses on early retirement of debt net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate nongaap adjusted eps from continuing operations differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies prior year amounts have been revised to present adjusted eps on a continuing operations basis 



note the sum of the nongaap adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding 

 

we have also disclosed aftertax return on invested capital for continuing operations roic which is a ratio based on gaap information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases operating leases are capitalized as part of the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors we believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time other companies may calculate roic differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 







a   represents the addback to operating income driven by the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases using eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense and an estimated interest rate of six percent 

b   see the following reconciliation of capitalized operating leases table for the adjustments to our gaap total rent expense to obtain the hypothetical capitalization of operating leases and related operating lease interest 

c   calculated using the effective tax rate for continuing operations which was 325  percent and 330  percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  

d   calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense 

e   average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the prior period 

f   excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses roic was 139 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30 2016 

capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the most comparable gaap measure is total rent expense capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 



analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance increased to 4046 million  from 2210 million  in 2014  primarily reflecting the proceeds from the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses due to the timing of the sale late in 2015 we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015 shortterm investments of 3008 million and 1520 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2015  and 2014  respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

cash flows 

our 2015  operations were funded by internally generated funds operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5140 million  in 2015  compared with 5131 million  in 2014  proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations these cash flows combined with period yearend cash position allowed us to invest in the business pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program 

inventory 

yearend inventory was 8601 million  compared with 8282 million  in 2014  the increase was due to investments to drive growth in certain merchandise categories improve instocks and earlier receipts of certain merchandise 

share repurchases 

in june 2015 our board of directors authorized a 5 billion expansion of our existing share repurchase program to 10 billion under this program we have repurchased 946 million  shares of common stock through january 30 2016  at an average price of 6957  for a total investment of 66 billion  

during 2015 we repurchased 447 million  shares of our common stock for a total investment of 3441 million   7707  per share including shares repurchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements we did not repurchase any shares on the open market during 2014 however as described in note 25  to the financial statements we reacquired 08 million shares upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1362 million  in 2015  and 1205 million  in 2014  an increase of 130 percent we declared dividends totaling 1378 million 220 per share in 2015  a per share increase of 106 percent over 2014  we declared dividends totaling 1271 million 199 per share in 2014  a per share increase of 206 percent over 2013  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

shortterm and longterm financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of january 30 2016  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above 

in 2015  we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds in 2014 we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 



we have additional liquidity through a committed 225 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2015  2014  or 2013 under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 30 2016  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from canada pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future our exit from canada increased our aftertax cash flows beginning in 2015 we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

capital expenditures 



capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer largeformat stores and realized efficiency gains in technology partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments capital expenditures were less than our initial expectations reflecting efficiency gains in technology combined with the impact of project timing shifts as we aligned investments against specific initiatives to drive growth invest in our supply chain and build out our omnichannel capabilities capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores partially offset by increased technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements 

we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to return to a level comparable with 2013 and 2014 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however except as discussed below regarding canada exitrelated costs we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future 

estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 8601 million  and 8282 million  at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively and is further described in note 12  of the financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors vendor income vendor income is earned for a variety of programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions advertising allowances and compliance programs we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material excluding pharmacyrelated receivables which were insignificant at periodend vendor income receivable was 379 million  and 426 million  at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively the vendor income receivable balance is described further in note 4  of the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 54 million  124 million  and 77 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively which are described further in note 14  as of january 30 2016  a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of 7 million in 2015  historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments as appropriate we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing 

outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities forward commitments unsubordinated related party payables lease liabilities and other potential claims potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts based on our estimates the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets 

to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims 

our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates see note 7  of the financial statements for further information 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 498 million and 566 million at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 25 million in 2015  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 215 million and 195 million at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 23  of the financial statements 

pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the periodend benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year 

our 2015 expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 75 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 84 percent  72 percent  68 percent  and 85 percent  for the 5year 10year 15year and 20year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 35 million based on a change in our asset allocation policy in late 2015 our expected longterm rate of return is 68 percent for 2016  

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 32 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension benefits are further described in note 28  of the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents when a loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated 

range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of canada exitrelated loss exposures we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note 7  of the financial statements for further information on the canada exitrelated contingencies respectively 

new accounting pronouncements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases  to require organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the balance sheet the new standard is effective in 2019 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our financial statements 

we do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements

at january 30 2016  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments at january 30 2016  our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 1758 million based on our balance sheet position at january 30 2016  the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate shortterm investments net of our debt obligations would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 2 million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 20  and 21  of the notes to financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position at january 30 2016  the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 9 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 32 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 15  and note 27  of the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face for the convenience of the reader the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply but they may also apply to other categories 

competitive and reputational risks 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store and technology development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties for example we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the data breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 and while we now believe the incident will not have a longterm impact to our relationship with our guests it is an example of an incident that affected our reputation and negatively impacted our sales for a period of time in addition the longterm reputational impact of discontinuing our canadian operations on our guests team members vendors and other constituencies is unknown and we may need to take actions that could increase our expenses and adversely affect the results of our operations 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality and reliability of our digital channels our instock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine realtime product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our pricematch policy failure to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses 

if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our guests our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website targetcom offer applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our omnichannel retailing efforts include implementing new technology software and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers which is extremely complex and may not meet guest expectations for timely and accurate deliveries if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our omnichannel efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology in a timely manner allow realtime and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guest‑facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests reliably function as designed or maintain the privacy of guest data or if we are unable consistently meet our brand promise to our guests we may experience a loss of guest confidence lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise for example we are investing more of our overall resources including capital marketing and product development to focus on signature categories including baby kids wellness and style and tailor our food assortment to support guest wellness goals and become more specialized with unique and differentiated items failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability 

technology investments and infrastructure risks 

if our capital investments in technology new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments and the returns on these investments are less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology and evolve our inventory management system information processes and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller and nonstandard footprints located in fully developed markets which are generally more timeconsuming and expensive undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service redcard accounts and summarize and analyze results and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations the data breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 negatively impacted our ability to handle customer inquiries and we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the data breach similarly we experienced a temporary network disruption not involving a data breach in june 2014 that prevented many of our pointofsale registers from working in a limited geographic region this disruption caused checkout delays and generated negative publicity and we engaged in promotional activities to retain our customers during the delay 

we continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence 

data security and privacy risks 

if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests team members and vendors are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer 

an important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests team members and vendors we have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and temporary staff 

until the data breach in the fourth quarter of 2013 all incidents we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents other than the data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements if we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or pharmacy services or stop shopping with us altogether 

we have recorded significant expenses related to the data breach our losses could exceed the amounts we have recorded by material amounts and these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the data breach we experienced was significant went undetected for several weeks and involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the data breach and we are currently facing litigation seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach in addition state and federal agencies including state attorneys general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating events related to the data breach including how it occurred its consequences and our responses the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose on us fines andor other monetary relief andor injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security costs adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers furthermore three of the four major 

payment card networks which between them represent a substantial majority of the payment cards potentially impacted by the data breach have made written claims against us either directly or through our acquiring banks and we believe that it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make a claim against us collectively the claims investigations and other possible consequences of the data breach may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations in the future we may be subject to additional investigations and claims of this sort we have recorded data breachrelated expenses that include our estimated probable losses for these matters and it is reasonably possible that we may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued 

supply chain and third party risks 

interruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network increased commodity supply chain and fulfillment costs or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner as we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations for example the labor disputes impacting the ports on the west coast of the us that began in 2014 have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these disputes recur or worsen it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations we are unable to determine whether our decision to discontinue our canadian operations will negatively impact our relationships with vendors that also supply our us operations in a way that might cause less favorable terms increased costs result in less timely and efficient deliveries or impact their ability to sell to target 

a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including portions of our technology development and systems our digital platforms and distribution network operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program and aspects of our clinic and pharmacy operations if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services inhouse 

legal regulatory global and other external risks 

our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

virtually all of our sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins 

these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and directly to guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of target team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 347000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business changes many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations as of march 13 2015 none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

we maintain a headquarters location in india where there has been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channels and information technology development 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and children’s products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate significant workforcerelated legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible workforcerelated legislative changes include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment 

affecting medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices for example we are currently facing government inquiries related to the data breach that may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties in addition any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the recent retailindustry data breaches could increase or accelerate our compliance costs also our pharmacy and clinic operations are governed by various regulations and a significant change in or our noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our compliance costs and results of operations in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

financial risks 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we are unable to make a fair and orderly exit of our canadian operations or if our existing reserves are not adequate to cover our ultimate liability our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

on january 15 2015 we announced our decision to discontinue our canadian operations and authorized a filing by our direct wholly owned subsidiary target canada co and certain other subsidiaries under the companies’ creditors arrangement act canada during the fourth quarter ended january 31 2015 we reported pretax losses from our discontinued canadian operations including pretax exit losses a noncash pretax impairment charge and other operating losses the losses from discontinued operations include probable losses relating to certain claims that may be asserted against us as a result of our guaranty of certain obligations of target canada co or other claims that may be made against us our reserves relating to these matters may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability and amounts beyond our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may suffer other losses for which we have not established reserves although we believe that possibility is not probable if we are unable to effectively and efficiently execute the winddown of our canadian operations we may incur additional costs and cash outflows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

fiscal 2014 included the following notable items 

 

sales from continuing operations were 72618 million  for 2014  an increase of 1339 million  or 19  percent from the prior year earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2014  decreased by 636 million  or 123 percent from 2013  to 4535 million  cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5131 million  7519 million  and 5568 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in connection with the sale of our us credit card receivables we received cash of 57 billion during 2013 of this amount 27 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and 30 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations 



note adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps a nongaap metric excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued canadian operations management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 21 

 

canada exit 

on january 14 2015 following a comprehensive assessment of canadian operations our board of directors approved a plan to discontinue operating stores in canada as a result of this decision on january 15 2015 target canada co and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of target collectively canada subsidiaries filed for protection the filing under the companies creditors arrangement act ccaa with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto the court the canada subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our canadian operations and our canadian segment the canada subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and stores in canada will remain open during the liquidation to assist with the exit plan the court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors 

as a result of the filing we no longer have a controlling interest in the canada subsidiaries for this reason we deconsolidated the canada subsidiaries effective january 15 2015 resulting in a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges collectively totaling 51 billion  the pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amounts of the canada subsidiaries assets liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interests at fair value 

subsequent to deconsolidation we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the canada subsidiaries which has been reflected as zero in our consolidated statement of financial position at january 31 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the canada subsidiaries net assets loans to and accounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries are recorded at an estimated fair value of 326 million  our ultimate cash recovery on these claims is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and could vary materially from our estimates 

our canada exit represents a strategic shift in our business for this reason our canadian segment results for all periods prior to the january 15 2015 deconsolidation and costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations 

we have recognized a tax benefit of 16 billion in discontinued operations which primarily relates to the loss on our investment in canada and includes other tax benefits resulting from certain asset writeoffs and liabilities paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation we have realized the majority of these tax benefits in the first quarter of 2015 and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in 2015 

the recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us primarily under guarantees in certain leases our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated given the early stage of our exit and the filing our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries we are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the yearend accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved we believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods any such losses would be recorded in discontinued operations 

we expect to incur severance legal and professional services expenses associated with our canadian exit we will recognize these expenses within discontinued operations as services are received and liabilities are incurred we currently cannot predict the timing of such expenses and associated cash disbursements however we do not expect these amounts to be material to our results in future periods 

see note 6 of the financial statements for further information regarding our canada exit 

data breach 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network the data breach in 2014 we recorded 191 million of pretax data breachrelated expenses and 46 million of expected insurance proceeds for net expenses of 145 million these expenses were included in our consolidated statements of operations as selling general and administrative expenses sga but were not part of segment sga along with legal and other professional services these expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breachrelated claims including claims by the payment card networks our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these claims to be litigated 

as of january 31 2015 we have incurred 252 million of cumulative data breachrelated expenses partially offset by 90 million of expected insurance recoveries for net cumulative expenses of 162 million 

for more information about the data breach see note 17 of the financial statements 

analysis of results of operations 

segment results 



note effective january 15 2015 we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations excluding net interest expense data breach related costs and certain other expenses which are discretely managed our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores online or through mobile devices see note 28 of our financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

 



note rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage the increase in 2014 sales reflects a 13  percent increase in comparable sales and the contribution from new stores   the   sales decline in 2013  reflected the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales partially offset by the contribution from new stores inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length comparable sales include all sales from stores open at least 13 months digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites including those of acquired entities from the date of acquisition and may be fulfilled through our distribution centers or our stores comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 





note amounts may not foot due to rounding  



 

further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores 

td offers credit to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target visa credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a redcard at target we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total redcard penetration due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 294 percent in 2014  298 percent in 2013  and 297 percent in 2012  the 2014 decrease is primarily due to promotional activity 

the 2013 increase was primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs resulting in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of sga increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

our sga expense rate was 199 percent in 2014 200 percent in 2013 and 191  percent in 2012 the decrease in 2014 primarily related to companywide expense optimization efforts partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives none of which were individually significant 

the increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives changes in merchandise vendor contracts described above and other increases increases were partially offset by the benefit from our companywide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll 

store data 





 

other performance factors 

other selling general and administrative expenses 

in addition to segment selling general and administrative expenses we recorded certain other expenses during 2014 and 2013 for 2014 these expenses included 145 million of net data breachrelated costs 16 million of impairments related to undeveloped us land and 13 million of costs related to previously announced plans to convert existing cobranded redcards to mastercard cobranded chipandpin cards in 2015 to support the accelerated transition to chipandpinenabled redcards for 2013 these expenses included a 23 million workforcereduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs a 22 million charge related to parttime team member health benefit changes 19 million in impairment charges related to undeveloped us land and 17 million of net data breachrelated costs additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 21 

net interest expense 

net interest expense from continuing operations was 882 million  1049 million  and 684 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of 285 million and 445 million respectively 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 330 percent in 2014  from 346 percent in 2013  driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 35 million and 16 million in 2014  and 2013  respectively a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 346 percent in 2013  from 344 percent in 2012  driven by a lower yearoveryear benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 16 million and 58 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps this metric excludes the impact of the 2013 sale of our us consumer credit card receivables portfolio losses on early retirement of debt net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our continuing operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate nongaap adjusted eps from continuing operations differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies prior year amounts have been revised to present adjusted eps on a continuing operations basis 



note the sum of the nongaap adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding 

 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance was 2210 million  compared with 670 million  in 2013  shortterm investments of 1520 million and 3 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2014  and 2013  respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

cash flows 

our 2014  operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was 5131 million  in 2014 compared with 7519 million  in 2013 net cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2013 includes 57 billion of cash received in connection with the sale of our us consumer credit card receivables of which 27 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and 30 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations in june 2014 we issued 1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in june 2019 and 1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in july 2024 combined with our prior yearend cash position these cash flows allowed us to repurchase 725 million of debt at a market value of 1 billion pay current debt maturities invest in the business and pay dividends 

yearend inventory levels increased from 8278 million  in 2013  to 8790 million  in 2014  accounts payable increased   by 424 million  or 58 percent over the same period 

share repurchases 

in january 2012 we began repurchasing shares under a 5 billion program authorized by our board of directors since the second quarter of 2013 we have not repurchased any shares on the open market however as described in note 23 of the financial statements we reacquired 08 million  shares during 2014 upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans during the first half of 2013  we repurchased 219 million  shares of our common stock for a total investment of 1474 million   6741  per share 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1205 million  in 2014  and 1006 million  in 2013  an increase of 198 percent we declared dividends totaling 1271 million 199 per share in 2014  a per share increase of 206 percent over 2013  we declared dividends totaling 1051 million 165 per share in 2013  a per share increase of 196 percent over 2012  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

shortterm and longterm financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings as of january 31 2015  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above standard and poors lowered our longterm debt rating from a to a during 2014 but maintained our a1 commercial paper rating 

as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges which represents the ratio of pretax earnings from continuing operations before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 602 x in 2014  648x in 2013  and 710x in 2012 see exhibit 12 for a description of how the gain on sale of our us credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2014 2013 and 2012 calculations 

in 2014  and 2013 we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 



we have additional liquidity through a committed 225 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2014  or 2013  under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 31 2015  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring 

acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from canada fund obligations incurred as a result of the data breach and any related future technology enhancements pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we believe that our exit from canada will increase our aftertax cash flows beginning in 2015 we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

capital expenditures 



capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores partially offset by technology investments to support of our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements capital expenditures decreased in 2013 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores we expect approximately 21 billion of capital expenditures in 2015 reflecting our focus on becoming a leading omnichannel retailer through investments in technology and supply chain elevating signature categories and opening new stores including urban formats 

capital expenditures related to our discontinued canadian operations were 228 million 1567 million and 932 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual 

results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however except as discussed below regarding canada exit and data breachrelated costs we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 8790 million  and 8278 million  at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively and is further described in note 10 of the financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors vendor income vendor income is earned for a variety of programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions advertising allowances and compliance programs we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 493 million  and 536 million  at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively and is described further in note 4 of the financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 124 million  77 million  and 37 million  in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively which are described further in note 12 as of january 31 2015  a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of 5 million in 2014 historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities at the time of the filing we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments as appropriate we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing 

outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities forward commitments unsubordinated related party payables lease liabilities and other potential claims potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts based on our estimates the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets 

to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims 

our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries our ultimate recovery is subject to the 

final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates see note 6 of the financial statements for further information 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 566 million and 576 million at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 28 million in 2014  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters since the data breach we have recognized 90 million of expected insurance recoveries related to the data breach as of january 31 2015 we have a 60 million insurancerecovery receivable relating to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable however it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 195 million and 241 million at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 21 of the financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions used to determine the periodend benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 75 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 121 percent  83 percent  70 percent  and 97 percent  for the 5year 10year 15year and 20year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 31 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 29 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 26 of the financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents when a loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range 

if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of canada exit and data breachrelated loss exposures we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to notes 6 and 17 of the financial statements for further information on the canada exit and data breachrelated contingencies respectively 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans the expected returns on pension plan assets the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for investigations inquiries claims and litigation including those related to the data breach and discontinuing our canadian operations expected insurance recoveries expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition including net operating loss carryforwards and tax benefits related to discontinuing our canadian operations the process timing and effects of discontinuing our canadian operations the resolution of tax matters and changes in our assumptions and expectations 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at january 31 2015  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments at january 31 2015  our floating rate shortterm investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately 270 million based on our balance sheet position at january 31 2015 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate shortterm investments net of our debt obligations would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 03 million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 18 and 19 of the notes to financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january 31 2015  the annualized 

effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 9 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 29 million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 13 and note 25 of the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests’ shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is increasingly important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality and reliability of our digital channels our instock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price we work with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encourage our guests to shop with confidence with our price match policy failure to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels and content could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties for example we experienced weaker than expected us segment sales following the announcement of the data breach and are unable to determine whether there will be a longterm impact to our relationship with our guests and whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activities to regain their trust  

if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable multichannel experience for our guests our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website targetcom applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments and technology investments by our competitors if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our multichannel efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology in a timely manner or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guest‑facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests or reliably function as designed we may experience a loss of guest 

confidence lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which if significant could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‑right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability 

our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

most of our stores and all of our digital sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‑sharing payments   

we rely on a large global and changing workforce of target team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 366000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing many team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations as of march 14 2014 none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

we have a concentration of support functions located in india where there has been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channels and information technology development 

if our capital investments in technology new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments and the returns on these investments are less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to support our multichannel efforts implement improvements to our guest‑facing technology and transform our information processes and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best 

investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 

in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are located in fully developed markets which are generally more timeconsuming and expensive undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets 

interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations in addition changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and children’s products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

the data breach we experienced in 2013 has resulted in government inquiries and private litigation and if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests and team members are unsuccessful future issues may result in additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests and team members we have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and temporary staff until the fourth quarter of 2013 all incidents we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced was significant and went undetected for several weeks we experienced weaker than expected us segment sales immediately following the announcement of the data breach and we are currently facing more than 80 civil lawsuits filed on behalf of guests payment card issuing banks and shareholders in addition state and federal agencies including state attorneys general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating events related to the data breach including how it occurred its consequences and our responses those claims and investigations may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations 

if we experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or pharmacy services or stop shopping with us altogether 

our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states canada and other countries in which we operate significant workforcerelated legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible workforcerelated legislative changes include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment affecting medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices for example we are currently facing government inquiries related to the data breach that may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties in addition any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the recent retailindustry data breaches could increase or accelerate our compliance costs also our pharmacy and clinic operations are governed by various regulations and a significant change in or our noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our compliance costs and results of operations in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income 

a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions manage guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service redcard accounts and summarize and analyze results and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to 

damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations the data breach we experienced negatively impacted our ability to timely handle customer inquiries and we experienced weaker than expected us segment sales following the announcement of the data breach 

we continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence 

if we do not positively differentiate the target experience and appeal to our new canadian guests our financial results could be adversely affected 

in fiscal 2013 we opened 124 target stores in canada which was our first retail store expansion outside of the united states our initial sales and operating results in canada have not met our initial expectations improving our sales in canada is contingent on our ability to deploy new marketing programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada and achieve market acceptance by canadian guests in addition our sales and operating results in canada are dependent on our ability to manage our inventory to offer the expected assortment of merchandise to our canadian guests while avoiding overstock situations and general macroeconomic conditions in canada if we do not effectively execute our marketing program and manage our inventory in canada our financial results could be adversely affected 

a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including our canadian supply chain portions of our technology development and systems our multichannel platforms and distribution network operations credit and debit card transaction processing and extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if those third parties fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services inhouse 

we experienced a significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and are not yet able to determine the full extent of its impact and the impact of government investigations and private litigation on our results of operations which could be material 

the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network our investigation of the matter is ongoing and it is possible that we will identify additional information that was accessed or stolen which could materially worsen the losses and reputational damage we have experienced for example when the intrusion was initially identified we thought the information stolen was limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information was also stolen 

we are currently subject to a number of governmental investigations and private litigation and other claims relating to the data breach and in the future we may be subject to additional investigations and claims of this sort these investigations and claims could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or profitability our financial liability arising from such investigations and claims will depend on many factors one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards while that portion of our network was determined to be compliant by an independent thirdparty assessor in the fall of 2013 we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks to claim that we were not in compliance another factor is whether and if so to what extent any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders card issuers andor the payment card networks on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the data breach can be properly attributed to the data breach and whether and if so to what extent it would in any event be our legal responsibility in addition the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose on us fines andor other monetary relief andor injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security costs adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers 

finally we believe that the greatest risk to our business arising out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our guests as well as the possibility of decreased participation in our redcards rewards loyalty program which our internal analysis has indicated drives meaningful incremental sales we experienced weaker than expected us segment sales after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be a longterm impact to our relationship with our guests or whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activities to regain their trust which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or profitability

note we have disclosed adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted eps a nongaap metric which excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations including the impact of our canadian market entry management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful in order to provide periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 25 

 

data breach 

description of event 

as previously disclosed we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network the data breach based on our investigation to date we believe that the intruder accessed and stole payment card data from approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts of guests who shopped at our us stores between november 27 and december 15 2013 through malware installed on our pointofsale system in our us stores on december 15 we removed the malware from virtually all registers in our us stores   payment card data used in transactions made by 56 additional guests in the period between december 16 and december 17 was stolen prior to our disabling malware on one additional register that was disconnected from our system when we completed the initial malware removal on december 15 in addition the intruder stole certain guest information including names mailing addresses phone numbers or email addresses for up to 70 million individuals our investigation of the matter is ongoing and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties 

expenses incurred and amounts accrued   

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded 61 million of pretax data breachrelated expenses and expected insurance proceeds of 44 million for net expenses of 17 million 11 million after tax or 002 per diluted share these expenses were included in our consolidated statements of operations as selling general and administrative expenses sga but were not part of our segment results expenses include costs to investigate the data breach provide creditmonitoring services to our guests increase staffing in our call centers and procure legal and other professional services 

the 61 million of fourth quarter expenses also includes an accrual related to the expected payment card networks’ claims by reason of the data breach the ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and nonordinary course operating expenses such as card reissuance costs that the payment card networks believe they or their issuing banks have incurred in order for us to have liability for such claims we believe that a court would have to find among other things that 1 at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards in a manner that contributed to the data breach and 2 the network operating rules around reimbursement of operating costs and counterfeit fraud losses are enforceable while an independent thirdparty assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013 we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those standards at the time of the data breach we base that expectation on our understanding that in cases like ours where prior to a data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent thirdparty assessor to be fully compliant with those standards the networkapproved forensic investigator nonetheless regularly claims that the breached entity was not in fact compliant with those standards as a result we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us we expect to dispute the payment card networks’ anticipated claims and we think it is likely that our disputes would lead to settlement negotiations consistent with the experience of other entities that have suffered similar payment card breaches we believe such negotiations would effect a combined settlement of both the payment card networks counterfeit fraud loss allegations and their nonordinary course operating expense allegations we based our yearend accrual on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements of the payment card networks’ anticipated claims and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claims were they to be litigated currently we can only reasonably estimate a loss associated with settlements of the networks expected claims for nonordinary course operating expenses the yearend accrual does not include any amounts associated with the networks expected claims for alleged incremental counterfeit fraud losses because the loss associated with settling such claims while probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received thirdparty fraud reporting from the payment card networks we are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the yearend accrual related to the expected settlement of the payment card networks’ claims because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved we believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods 

litigation and governmental investigations 

in addition more than 80 actions have been filed in courts in many states and other claims have been or may be asserted against us on behalf of guests payment card issuing banks shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach state and federal agencies including the state attorneys general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating events related to the data breach including how it occurred its consequences and our responses although we are cooperating in these investigations we may be subject to fines or other obligations which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations while a loss from these matters is reasonably possible we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses because our investigation into the matter is ongoing the proceedings remain in the early stages alleged damages have not been specified there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved further we do not believe that a loss from these matters is probable therefore we have not recorded a loss contingency liability for litigation claims and governmental investigations in the fourth quarter see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

future costs 

we expect to incur significant investigation legal and professional services expenses associated with the data breach in future periods we will recognize these expenses as services are received we also expect to incur additional expenses associated with incremental fraud and reissuance costs on target redcards 

insurance coverage 

to limit our exposure to data breach losses we maintain 100 million of networksecurity insurance coverage above a 10 million deductible this coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure we will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under the policies as of february 1 2014 we have recorded a 44 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage which partially offsets the 61 million of expense relating to the data breach 

future capital investments 

we plan to accelerate a previously planned investment of approximately 100 million to equip our proprietary redcards and all of our us store card readers with chipenabled smartcard technology by the first quarter of 2015 

in addition we may accelerate or make additional investments in our information technology systems but we are unable to estimate such investments because the nature and scope has not yet been determined we do not expect such amounts to be material to any fiscal period 

effect on sales and guest loyalty 

we believe the data breach adversely affected our fourth quarter us segment sales prior to our december 19 2013 announcement of the data breach our us segment fourth quarter comparable sales were positive followed by meaningfully negative comparable sales results following the announcement comparable sales began to recover in january 2014 the collective interaction of yearoveryear changes in the retail calendar  eg  the number of days between thanksgiving and christmas combined with the broad array of competitive consumer behavioral and weather factors makes any quantification of the precise impact of the data breach on sales infeasible 

fourth quarter sales penetration on our redcards was 209 percent up 54 percentage points from 2012 while the rate of increase slowed following the data breach yearoveryear penetration continued to grow 

we know our guests confidence in target and the broader us payment system has been shaken we are committed to and actively engaged in activities to restore their confidence we cannot predict the length or extent of any ongoing impact to sales 

credit card receivables transaction 

in march 2013 we sold our entire us consumer credit card portfolio to td and recognized a gain of 391 million this transaction was accounted for as a sale and the receivables are no longer reported in our consolidated statements of financial position consideration received included cash of 57 billion equal to the gross par value of the 

outstanding receivables at the time of closing and a 225 million beneficial interest asset the beneficial interest asset effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profitsharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold based on historical payment patterns we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a fouryear period following the sale with larger reductions in the early years as of february 1 2014 a 127 million beneficial interest asset remained concurrent with the sale of the portfolio we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 20062007 series variable funding certificate at par of 15 billion resulting in net cash proceeds of 42 billion 

td now underwrites funds and owns target credit card and target visa consumer receivables in the us td controls risk management policies and oversees regulatory compliance and we perform account servicing and primary marketing functions we earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios income from the td profitsharing arrangement and our related account servicing expenses are classified within sga expenses in the us segment 

beginning with the first quarter of 2013 we no longer report a us credit card segment 

analysis of results of operations 

us segment 



note prior period segment results have been revised to reflect the combination of our historical us retail segment and us credit card segment into one us segment quarterly and fullyear historical information for the three most recently completed years reflecting the results for the us segment and canadian segment are attached as exhibit 99 to our current report on form 8k filed april 16 2013 

note see note 28 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

 





rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage the decrease in sales in 2013 reflects the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales partially offset by the contribution from new stores   sales growth in 2012  resulted from higher comparable sales the contribution from new stores and a 17 percentage point benefit from an additional week in the fiscal year inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies comparable sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than thirteen months 





 20 

 

the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

credit is offered by td to qualified guests through targetbranded credit cards the target credit card and the target visa credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards ®  guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a redcard at target we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target 



note the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total store redcard penetration due to rounding 

gross margin rate 

                   

our gross margin rate was 298 percent in 2013  297 percent in 2012  and 301 percent in 2011  the 2013 increase is primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program 

the 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts resulted in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of sga this change increased our gross margin rate for 2013 with an equal and offsetting increase in our sga rate and has no impact on ebitda or ebit margin rates 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

  

a represents revised us segment results 

our sga expense rate was 200 percent in 2013  and 191 percent in both 2012  and 2011  the increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives changes in merchandise vendor contracts described on the previous page and other increases increases were partially offset by the benefit from our companywide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll during 2012 investments in technology and supply chain were offset by improvements in store hourly payroll and disciplined expense management across the company 

store data 





 

canadian segment 





note rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

due to the startup nature of our canadian segment the rates above may not be indicative of future results 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage 

we opened 124 canadian target general merchandise stores during 2013 with 142 million total retail square feet canadian sales of 1317 million  represent a partial year of operation with approximately 55 percent of the stores opened during the first half of the year 20 percent during the third quarter and the remaining 25 percent during the fourth quarter 

credit is offered to guests by royal bank of canada rbc through our cobranded credit card the target rbc mastercard additionally we offer a proprietary target debit card consistent with our branded payment products in the us these payment products are referred to as redcards guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a redcard at target 



gross margin rate 

the gross margin rate of 149  percent reflects efforts to clear excess inventory following lower than anticipated sales and supply chain startup challenges 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

in addition to operating expenses during 2013 our canadian segment sga expense for 2013 2012 and 2011 included startup costs including compensation benefits and thirdparty service expenses 

other performance factors 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses 

in addition to our selling general and administrative expenses recorded within our segments we recorded certain other expenses during 2013 these expenses included a 23 million workforcereduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs a 22 million charge related to parttime team member health benefit changes 19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land and 17 million of data breachrelated costs net of expected insurance proceeds additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 25 

net interest expense 

net interest expense was 1126 million  in 2013  this increase of 477 percent or 364 million  from 2012  was due to a 445 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2013 partially offset by the benefit from 2013 debt reductions 

net interest expense was 762 million  for 2012  this decrease of 120 percent or 104 million from 2011  was primarily due to an 87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate increased to 365 percent in 2013  from 349 percent in 2012  which was driven by the net effect of increased losses related to canadian operations combined with a lower yearoveryear benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by 16 million and 58 million in 2013  and 2012  respectively a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

our effective income tax rate increased to 349 percent in 2012  from 343 percent in 2011  primarily due to a lower benefit associated with the favorable resolution of various income tax matters combined with the effect of increased losses related to canadian operations various income tax matters were resolved in 2012  and 2011  which reduced tax expense by 58 million and 85 million respectively 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes the impact of our 2013 canadian market entry the gain on receivables transaction favorable resolution of various income tax matters the loss on early retirement of debt and other matters presented below we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our us operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share nongaap adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate nongaap adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note a nongaap financial measures summary is provided on page 16 the sum of the nongaap adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding 

a total canadian losses include interest expense of 77 million 78 million and 44 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

b  2013 adjustment represents consideration received in the first quarter from the sale of our us credit card receivables in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables consideration included a beneficial interest asset of 225 million the 2012 adjustment represents the gain on receivables held for sale 

c  other includes a 23 million workforcereduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs a 22 million charge related to parttime team member health benefit changes and 19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land 

d  for 2013 we recorded 61 million of pretax data breachrelated expenses and expected insurance proceeds of 44 million for net pretax expenses of 17 million 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance was 695 million  compared with 784 million  in 2012  shortterm investments highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase of 3 million and 130 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2013  and 2012  respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

cash flows 

our 2013  operations were funded by both internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of our consumer credit card receivables portfolio cash flow provided by operations was 6520 million  in 2013  compared with 5325 million  in 2012  our cash flows combined with our prior yearend cash position allowed us to pay current debt maturities invest in the business pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program 

concurrent with the sale of our us credit card portfolio described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 20062007 series variable funding certificate at par of 15 billion also 

during the first quarter of 2013 we used 14 billion of the net proceeds received from the sale to repurchase at market value 970 million of debt we have applied additional proceeds from the sale to reduce our debt and repurchase shares 

yearend inventory levels increased from 7903 million  in 2012  to 8766 million  in 2013  about half of which was for our 2013 canadian market entry accounts payable increased by 627 million  or 89 percent over the same period 

share repurchases 

during the first quarter of 2012 we completed a 10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 and began repurchasing shares under a new 5 billion program authorized by our board of directors in january 2012 during 2013  we repurchased 219 million  shares of our common stock for a total investment of 1474 million   6741  per share we did not repurchase any shares during the second half of 2013 due to our performance and desire to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings during 2012  we repurchased 322 million  shares of our common stock for a total investment of 1900 million   5896  per share 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 1006 million  in 2013  and 869 million  in 2012  for an increase of 158 percent we declared dividends totaling 1051 million 165 per share in 2013  for an increase of 164 percent over 2012  we declared dividends totaling 903 million 138 per share in 2012  an increase of 162 percent over 2011  we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

shortterm and longterm financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings as of february 1 2014  our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each credit rating agency reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above our standard and poor’s rating currently carries a negative outlook and we believe that our recent operating performance may cause standard and poor’s to lower their longterm debt rating by one level 

as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was 47x in 2013  61x in 2012  and 59x in 2011 refer to exhibit 12 for a description of how the gain on sale of our us credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2013 calculation 

in 2013  we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper in 2012 we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds 



we have additional liquidity through a committed 225 billion revolving credit facility obtained in october 2011 which was amended during 2013 to extend the expiration date to october 2018 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2013  or 2012  under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at february 1 2014  no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund obligations incurred as a result of the data breach and any related future technology enhancements pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

capital expenditures 



capital expenditures increased in 2013 from the prior year due to canadian expenditures in advance of 2013 store openings partially offset by fewer remodels and new stores in the us  the decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the 2011 purchase of zellers leases in canada and fewer 2012 us store remodels partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the us and canada and technology and multichannel investments we expect approximately 24 to 27 billion of capital expenditures in 2014 reflecting an estimated 21 to 23 billion in our us segment including the previously discussed acceleration of our investment in chipenabled smart card technology and approximately 03 to 04 billion in our canadian segment 

commitments and contingencies 



 

off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets 

and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 8766 million  and 7903 million  at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively and is further described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 555 million and 621 million at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively and is described further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of 77 million 37 million and 43 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and are described further in note 12 as of february 1 2014  a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of 7 million in 2013 historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 576 million and 627 million at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 28 million in 2013  historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters as of february 1 2014 we have recognized a 44 million insurancerecovery receivable relating to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable however it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 241 million and 280 million at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as of february 1 2014 we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 1466 million which are available to offset future income these carryforwards are primarily related to the startup operations of the canadian segment and expire between 2031 and 2033 we establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that we believe will not be realized we have evaluated the positive and negative evidence and consider it more likely than not that these carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to expiration therefore we have not established a valuation allowance income taxes are described further in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions used to determine the periodend benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 104 percent  83 percent  72 percent  and 92 percent  for the 5year 10year 15year and 20year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 29 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 30 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal and other contingencies we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents when a loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of data breachrelated loss exposures we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods 

for data breachrelated exposures we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of probable loss in excess of the recorded payment card network contingent losses we believe that losses from the payment card networks in excess of the amounts recorded in fiscal 2013 are reasonably possible and that these losses could be material to our results of operations in future periods but we are unable to estimate a range of such reasonably possible 

losses we are also unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses arising from data breachrelated litigation and governmental investigations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the data breachrelated contingencies 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include our financial performance statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans the expected returns on pension plan assets the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserves for investigations inquiries claims and litigation including those related to the data breach expected insurance recoveries expected changes to our contractual obligations the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities including foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the resolution of tax matters 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at february 1 2014  our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments at february 1 2014  our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short term investments by approximately 1 billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at february 1 2014 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our shortterm investments would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 1 million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate shortterm investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 18 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at february 1 2014  the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 8 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 30 million the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 13 and note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

working capital 

because of the seasonal nature of our business our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from thanksgiving to the end of december the increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and shortterm borrowings additional details are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our instock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses 

we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands discussed on page 2 these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected 

the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price we have been working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price match policy failure to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failure of our vendors to manage their own channels and content could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities while reputations may take decades to build even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties 

if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable multichannel experience for our guests our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels instore online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website targetcom applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments and technology investments by our competitors if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the 

specialized skills needed to support our multichannel efforts implement improvements to our guestfacing technology in a timely manner or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guestfacing technology systems do not reliably function as designed we may experience a loss of guest confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which if significant could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability 

our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

most of our stores and all of our digital sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence and guest financial situations could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td bank group td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profitsharing payments 

if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 361000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain qualified team members many of those team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations as of march 20 2013 none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and 

businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developers ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store sites is located in fully developed markets which is generally a more timeconsuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets 

interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations in addition changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including labor fuel tariffs and currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

if our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our guests and team members are unsuccessful we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests and team members we have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents to date all incidents we have experienced have been insignificant if we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of redcards decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping with us altogether the loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving team members could hurt our reputation cause team member recruiting and retention challenges increase our labor costs and affect how we operate our business 

our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales 

weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales 

changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations in addition the expansion of our retail store operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions service redcard accounts and summarize and analyze results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter a loss of guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we do not effectively execute our plan to expand retail store operations into canada our financial results could be adversely affected 

our 2013 entry into the canadian retail market is our first retail store expansion outside of the united states our ability to successfully open the expected number of canadian target stores on schedule depends in large measure upon our ability to remodel existing assets build our supply chain capabilities and technology systems and recruit hire and retain qualified team members in addition our ability to offer the expected assortment of merchandise in certain markets may be impacted by the availability of local vendors of certain types of goods the effective execution of our canadian retail store expansion is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada and achieve market acceptance by canadian guests if we do not effectively execute our expansion plan in canada our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations 

we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including our canadian supply chain portions of our technology systems multichannel platforms and distribution network and extensions of credit for our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if those third parties fail to meet our performance standards and expectations our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services inhouse

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest january 31 the 2012 period includes 53 weeks while 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks 

consolidated revenues were 73301 million for 2012 an increase of 3436 million or 49 percent from the prior year consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2012 increased by 49 million or 09 percent over 2011 to 5371 million cash flow provided by operations was 5325 million 5434 million and 5271 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively diluted earnings per share in 2012 increased 56 percent to 452 from 428 in the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share which we believe is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our us operations increased 79 percent to 476 in 2012 from 441 in the prior year

a consisted of 53 weeks b adjustments represent the diluted eps impact of our 2013 canadian market entry the gain on receivables held for sale favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt 

our 2012 financial results in our us retail segment reflect increased sales of 51 percent over the same period last year due to a 27 percent comparablestore increase the contribution from new stores and the additional week in 2012 our 2012 us retail segment earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda margin rate decreased slightly from the prior period primarily due to a lower gross margin rate from our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program our earnings before interest expense and income taxes ebit margin rate remained consistent with the prior year due to a decrease in our depreciation and amortization rate 

in the us credit card segment we experienced a decrease in segment profit due to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year and lower finance charge revenue resulting from a smaller portfolio these changes were partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of 2769 million in collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as the additional week in 2012 

the 2012 and 2011 loss in our canadian segment totaling 369 million and 122 million respectively is comprised of startup costs and depreciation related to our 2013 entry into the canadian retail market 

credit card receivables transaction 

on october 22 2012 we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to td bank group td historically our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts with this agreement our receivables are classified as held for sale at february 2 2013 and are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value we recorded a gain of 161 million outside of our segments in 2012 representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost par or fair value 

on march 13 2013 we completed the sale to td for cash consideration of 57 billion equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing concurrent with the sale of the portfolio for 57 billion we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 20062007 series variable funding certificate at par of 15 billion resulting in net cash proceeds of 42 billion as of march 20 2013 we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of 12 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt over time we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investmentgrade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program 

following this sale td will underwrite fund and own target credit card and target visa receivables in the us td will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance and we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions we will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios this transaction will be accounted for as a sale and the receivables will no longer be reported on our consolidated statements of financial position 

in the first quarter of 2013 we will recognize a gain on sale of 391 million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables consideration received includes cash of 57 billion and a beneficial interest asset of 225 million the beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profitsharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold based on historical payment patterns we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period with larger reductions in the early years as a result a portion of the profitsharing payments we receive from td in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our consolidated statements of operations 

following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013 income from the profitsharing arrangement net of account servicing expenses will be recognized within sga expenses including the profitsharing arrangement in the us segment will reduce the sga rate below the historical us retail segment sga rate and raise ebitda and ebit margin rates above historical us retail segment rates 

for comparison purposes historical us retail segment and us credit card segment results will be restated to form a new us segment the combination of these two historical segments into a single us segment will result in a higher sga rate in 2013 compared with 2012 2011 and 2010 reflecting credit card profit that will be retained by td beginning in 2013 

although we expect lower ebitda and ebit margin rates in the us segment compared with prior periods we expect that the impact of the receivables sale transaction will become neutral and ultimately accretive to eps over time 

analysis of results of operations 

us retail segment 



note see note 29 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

a consisted of 53 weeks b effective with the october 2010 nationwide launch of our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program we changed the formula under which the us retail segment charges the us credit card segment to better align with the attributes of this program loyalty program charges were 300 million 258 million and 102 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to sga expenses within the us retail segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the us credit card segment 



rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

a consisted of 53 weeks 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns and gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage sales growth in 2012 and 2011 resulted from higher comparablestore sales and the contribution from new stores with 2012 also benefitting by 17 percentage points from the additional week inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented 

refer to the merchandise section in item 1 business for additional product category information 

comparablestore sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparablestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparablestore sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies comparablestore sales include all sales except sales from stores open less than thirteen months 



the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

credit is offered to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards the target credit card and the target visa target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards® since october 2010 guests receive a 5percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a redcard in november 2011 guests also began to receive free shipping at targetcom when they use their redcard 

we monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target with the remainder representing a shift in tender type 



gross margin rate 

our gross margin rate was 297 percent in 2012 301 percent in 2011 and 305 percent in 2010 the decrease in each period reflects the impact of our integrated growth strategies of our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program which impacted the rate by 04 percent and 05 percent in 2012 and 2011 respectively partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in 2011 the redcard rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive a 5percent discount on virtually all items purchased the remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a strongerthanaverage mix in lowerthanaverage gross margin rate product categories primarily food 

we changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in 2013 as a result we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about 20 to 25 basis points from prior years with an equal and offsetting increase in our sga rate this shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within sga this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our sga rate will increase by the same amount 

in january 2013 we announced plans to price match top online retailers yearround based on our experience during the 2012 holiday season we do not expect this change to significantly affect our gross margin rate 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

our sga expense rate was 199 percent 201 percent and 203 percent in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in 2012 was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense which impacted the rate by 01 percent and continued disciplined expense management across the company partially offset by technology and multichannel investments which impacted the rate by nearly 02 percent the change in 2011 was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the us credit segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense 

as noted above a 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our sga rate by about 20 to 25 basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain advertising expenses this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount 

following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013 income from the profitsharing arrangement net of account servicing expenses will be recognized as an offset to sga expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 28 percent 30 percent and 31 percent in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in 2012 was due to the favorable impact of higher sales combined with stable depreciation and amortization expenses reflecting the moderate pace of capital investments in recent years and the impact from the additional week in 2012 

store data 



a in thousands reflects total square feet less office distribution center and vacant space us credit card segment 

credit is offered to qualified guests through the target credit cards which support our core retail operations and are important contributors to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges late fees and other revenue and third party merchant fees which are amounts received from merchants who accept the target visa 



note see note 29 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

a consisted of 53 weeks b the combination of bad debt expense and operations and marketing expenses less amounts the us retail segment charges the us credit card segment for loyalty programs within the us credit card segment represent credit card expenses on the consolidated statements of operations for 2012 fourth quarter bad debt expense was replaced by net writeoffs in this calculation see footnote b to our us retail segment results table for an explanation of our loyalty program charges c amounts represent the portion of average credit card receivables at par funded by target for 2012 2011 and 2010 these amounts exclude 1423 million 3801 million and 4335 million respectively of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables d roic is return on invested capital this rate equals our segment profit divided by average credit card receivables at par funded by target expressed as an annualized rate e as a percentage of average credit card receivables at par for 2012 the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results to the prior period 



note numbers are individually rounded 

a consisted of 53 weeks b balanceweighted onemonth libor c spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor d as a percentage of average credit card receivables at par for 2012 the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results to the prior period 

our primary measure of segment profit is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we also measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor we 

continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our us credit card segment which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost par or fair value on a consolidated basis net writeoffs are reported within credit card expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

in 2012 and 2011 segment revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue in 2012 segment expense increases were driven by higher bad debt expense primarily attributable to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year in 2011 segment expenses decreased from the prior year as we significantly reduced our bad debt reserve due to improved trends in key measures of risk segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined in both 2012 and 2011 due to lower outstanding nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables 



  



a writeoffs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously writtenoff balances these amounts combined represent net writeoffs 

periodend and average credit card receivables at par have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in target visa charges at thirdparties partially offset by an increase in charges at target over the past two years the decrease in charges at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new target visa accounts 

canadian segment 

during 2012 and 2011 startup costs reported in sga expense in the consolidated statements of operations totaled 272 million and 74 million respectively and primarily consisted of compensation benefits and thirdparty 

service expenses additionally we recorded 97 million and 48 million in depreciation for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense was 762 million in 2012 including 78 million of interest on canadian capitalized leases this decrease of 120 percent or 104 million from 2011 was primarily due to an 87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011 as of march 20 2013 we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of 12 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt which will impact interest expense in 2013 

net interest expense was 866 million for 2011 increasing 144 percent or 109 million from 2010 this increase was due to an 87 million loss on early retirement of debt 44 million of interest on canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate increased to 349 percent in 2012 from 343 percent in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in canada which are tax effected at a lower rate than us earnings various income tax matters were resolved in 2012 and 2011 which reduced tax expense by 58 million and 85 million respectively a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 343 percent in 2011 from 351 percent in 2010 primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate this reduction was slightly offset by a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in canada which are tax effected at a lower rate than us earnings various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by 85 million and 102 million respectively 

we expect a 2013 consolidated effective income tax rate of 357 percent to 367 percent excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes the impact of our 2013 canadian market entry the gain on receivables held for sale favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our us operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share nongaap adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate nongaap adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note a nongaap financial measures summary is provided on page 14 the sum of the nongaap adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding 

a consisted of 53 weeks b represents interest expense net of interest income not included in us credit card segment profit for 2012 2011 and 2010 us credit card segment profit included 13 million 72 million and 83 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables respectively these amounts along with other net interest expense equal consolidated gaap net interest expense c represents the gain on receivables held for sale recorded in our consolidated statements of operations plus the difference between us credit card segment bad debt expense and net writeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2012 d taxes are allocated to our business segments based on income tax rates applicable to the operations of the segment for the period e for 2012 2011 and 2010 average diluted shares outstanding were 6633 million 6839 million and 7294 million respectively f represents the effect of resolution of income tax matters the 2012 results also include a 55 million tax expense for the adjustment related to receivables held for sale while the 2011 results include a 32 million tax benefit related to the loss on early retirement of debt g represents the loss on early retirement of debt 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance was 784 million compared with 794 million in 2011 shortterm investments highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase of 130 million and 194 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2012 and 2011 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

cash flows 

our 2012 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds cash flow provided by operations was 5325 million in 2012 compared with 5434 million in 2011 during 2012 we issued 15 billion of unsecured debt that matures in july 2042 and we amended the 20062007 series variable funding certificate to obtain additional funding of 500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013 these cash flows combined with our prior yearend cash position allowed us to fund capital expenditures pay current maturities pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program 

our 2012 periodend credit card receivables at par were 6024 million compared with 6357 million in 2011 a decrease of 52 percent average credit card receivables at par in 2012 decreased 51 percent compared with 2011 levels this change was driven by the factors indicated in the us credit card segment above as of february 2 2013 1500 million of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties 

on october 22 2012 we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to td bank group td on march 13 2013 we completed the sale to td for cash consideration of 57 billion equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing concurrent with the sale of the portfolio we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 20062007 series variable funding certificate at par of 15 billion resulting in net cash proceeds of 42 billion as of march 20 2013 we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of 12 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt over time we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investmentgrade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program 

yearend inventory levels decreased slightly from 7918 million in 2011 to 7903 million in 2012 primarily due to supply chain management improvements and continued disciplined inventory management partially offset by an increase in inventory for our 2013 canadian retail market entry accounts payable increased by 199 million or 29 percent over the same period 

share repurchases 

during the first quarter of 2012 we completed a 10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 and began repurchasing shares under a new 5 billion program authorized by our board of directors in january 2012 during 2012 we repurchased 322 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of 1900 million 5896 per share during 2011 we repurchased 372 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of 1894 million 5089 per share 

dividends 

we paid dividends totaling 869 million in 2012 and 750 million in 2011 for an increase of 159 percent we declared dividends totaling 903 million 138 per share in 2012 for an increase of 162 percent over 2011 we declared dividends totaling 777 million 115 per share in 2011 an increase of 178 percent over 2010 we have 

paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

shortterm and longterm financing 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the longterm debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings as of february 2 2013 our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above 

as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was 61x in 2012 59x in 2011 and 61x in 2010 

in 2012 we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds in 2011 we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued 



we have additional liquidity through a committed 225 billion revolving credit facility obtained in october 2011 and expiring in october 2017 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2012 or 2011 under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends additionally at february 2 2013 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and longterm financing 

capital expenditures 



a see note 29 to our consolidated financial statements for capital expenditures by segment 

the decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the purchase of zellers leases in canada in 2011 and fewer store remodels in the us in 2012 partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the us and canada and technology and multichannel investments we expect approximately 38 billion of capital expenditures in 2013 reflecting an estimated 23 billion in our us segment and approximately 15 billion in our canadian segment 

commitments and contingencies 



a represents principal payments only and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in longterm debt under derivative and hedge accounting rules see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information b total contractual lease payments include 3323 million and 2039 million of capital and operating lease payments respectively related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised these payments also include 947 million and 181 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2013 or later for capital and operating leases respectively capital lease obligations include interest see note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information c real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities d deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees forecasted investment returns and the projected timing of future retirements 25 

e estimated tax contingencies of 280 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement see note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information f real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities g purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketingrelated contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met h we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of february 2 2013 our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 7903 million and 7918 million at february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 respectively and is further described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 621 million and 592 million at february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 respectively and is described further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

credit card receivables accounting historically our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables were recorded we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future writeoffs the allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other creditrelated fees we estimated future writeoffs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends accounts were automatically written off when they became 180 days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations 

as of february 2 2013 our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card receivables transaction lower of cost par or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and creditquality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost par because fair value exceeds cost delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our credit card receivables 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation andor disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of february 2 2013 would result in additional impairment of 4 million in 2012 historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 627 million and 646 million at february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 31 million in 2012 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were 280 million and 318 million at february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected longterm rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions used to determine the periodend benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 57 percent 100 percent 78 percent and 95 percent for the 5year 10year 15year and 20year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected longterm rate of return would increase annual expense by 27 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 28 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 28 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include for our us credit card segment aggregate portfolio risks for our canadian segment the timing and amount of future capital investments in canada and our subsequent financial performance on a consolidated basis statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the fair value of our consumer credit card receivables the pending sale of these receivables and related gain including beneficial interest the application of proceeds from the sale and the impact on our future results of operations earnings and rates the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures the expected effective income tax rate the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans the expected returns on pension plan assets the impact of future changes in foreign currency exchange rates the expected changes in gross margin and sga rates the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation and property loss the expected outcome of claims and litigation the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities including foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the resolution of tax matters 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at february 2 2013 our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a primebased floatingrate historically to manage our net interest margin we generally maintained levels of floatingrate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuated the degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate environments at february 2 2013 the amount of floatingrate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floatingrate debt obligations by approximately 1 billion see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 20 and 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio funding risk was transferred to td bank group following the sale our interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at february 2 2013 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 9 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by 28 million the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against 

declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 36 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 15 and note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

we are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we will be further exposed to this risk as we commence canadian operations during 2013 during 2012 and 2011 gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant as all stores were located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise was purchased in us dollars 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic operational compliance reputational and financial risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our instock levels the convenience and reliability of our multichannel guest experience and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margin and expenses 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target including our owned and exclusive brands 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts loss of new store development opportunities or team member recruiting difficulties 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands such as market pantry up  up target home merona and mossimo these brands generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales totaling approximately onethird of sales in 2011 if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin rate could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our guests our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our guests are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online as part of our multichannel strategy we offer full and mobile versions of our website targetcom and applications for mobile phones and tablets in addition we use social media as a way to interact with our guests and enhance their shopping experiences multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills needed to support our multichannel platforms or are unable to implement improvements to our guestfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if targetcom and our other guestfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of guest confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margin and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions in apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations 

we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

all of our stores are currently located within the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales these same considerations impact the success of our us credit card segment deterioration in macroeconomic conditions can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to fully anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit resulting in higher bad debt expense demand for consumer credit is also impacted by consumer choices regarding payment methods and our performance could be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use thirdparty debit cards or other forms of payment 

if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 365000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain qualified team members many of those team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations as of march 15 2012 none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 

lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developers ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store sites is located in fully developed markets which is generally a more timeconsuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets 

interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our results 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or 

indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations in addition changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including labor fuel tariffs and currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on gross margin expenses and results of operations 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests and team members we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests and team members if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping at our stores or targetcom altogether the loss of confidence from a data security breach involving team members could hurt our reputation and cause team member recruiting and retention challenges 

our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our expenses 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations 

uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are more prevalent those natural disasters could result in 

significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors changes in the tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced inversely by capital market returns due to the taxfree nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital and the assetbacked securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures 

a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our plan to expand retail operations into canada could adversely affect our financial results 

our plan to enter the canadian retail market is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the united states our ability to successfully open the expected number of canadian target stores on schedule depends in large measure upon our ability to remodel existing assets build our supply chain capabilities and technology systems and recruit hire and retain qualified team members in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to offer the expected assortment of merchandise in certain markets the effective execution of our strategy is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada if we do not effectively execute our expansion plan in canada our financial performance could be adversely affected

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

consolidated revenues were 69865 million for 2011 an increase of 2475 million or 37 percent from the prior year consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2011 increased by 70 million or 13 percent over 2010 to 5322 million cash flow provided by operations was 5434 million 5271 million and 5881 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively diluted earnings per share in 2011 increased 70 percent to 428 from 400 in the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share which we believe is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our us operations increased 143 percent to 441 in 2011 from 386 in the prior year

a adjustments represent the diluted eps impact of our 2013 canadian market entry favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt 

our financial results for 2011 in our us retail segment reflect increased sales of 41 percent over the same period last year due to a 30 percent comparablestore increase combined with the contribution from new stores in 2011 we experienced a slight reduction in us retail segment ebitda margin rate compared to 2010 due primarily to a decrease in gross margin rate partially offset by a favorable selling general and administrative sga expense rate us retail segment ebit margin rate in 2011 was consistent with the 2010 rate we opened 21 new stores in 2011 13 net of 5 relocations and 3 closures during 2010 we opened 13 new stores 10 net of 1 relocation and 2 closures 

in the us credit card segment we achieved an increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk in our accounts receivable portfolio 

our canadian segment was initially reported in our first quarter 2011 financial results as a result of entering into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in canada operated by zellers inc zellers we acquired leasehold interests in 189 zellers sites for 1861 million and sold our right to acquire 54 of these sites to thirdparty retailers and landlords for 225 million these transactions resulted in a final net purchase price of 1636 million we believe this transaction will allow us to open 125 to 135 target stores in canada primarily during 2013 during 2011 canadian segment startup costs totaled 74 million and primarily consisted of compensation benefits and consulting expenses these expenses are reported in selling general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations

ebit is earnings before interest expense and income taxes 

note see note 28 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

a effective with the october 2010 nationwide launch of our 5 redcard rewards loyalty program we changed the formula under which the us retail segment charges the us credit card segment to better align with the attributes of this program loyalty program charges were 258 million in 2011 102 million in 2010 and 89 million in 2009 in all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to sga expenses within the us retail segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the us credit card segment 



rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns from our stores and our online business as well as gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage total sales for the us retail segment for 2011 were 68466 million compared with 65786 million in 2010 and 63435 million in 2009 all periods were 52week years growth in total sales between 2011 and 2010 as well as between 2010 and 2009 resulted from higher comparablestore sales and additional stores opened inflation did not materially affect sales during 2011 or 2010 during 2009 we experienced a deflationary impact on sales of approximately 36 percentage points 

refer to the merchandise section in item 1 business for additional product category information 

comparablestore sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores by measuring the change in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparablestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparablestore sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

comparablestore sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year including 

• sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open including our current store remodel program • sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes comparablestore sales do not include 

• sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted or relocated within the same trade area to a supertarget store format • sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled expanded or reconstructed 

in 2011 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by a slight increase in the number of transactions and an increase in the average transaction amount reflecting an increase in units per transaction and a slight increase in selling price per unit in 2010 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

our us credit card segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards the target visa credit card and the target credit card target credit cards additionally we offer a branded proprietary target debit card collectively we refer to these products as redcards® beginning october 2010 guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a redcard at any target store or on targetcom 

we monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target with the remainder representing a shift in tender type 



gross margin rate 

gross margin rate represents gross margin sales less cost of sales as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price expressed as a percentage of its retail price factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations vendor income sourcing strategies market forces like raw material and freight costs and competitive influences markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous 

price of retail merchandise factors that affect markdowns include inventory management competitive influences and economic conditions 

our gross margin rate was 301 percent in 2011 decreasing from 305 percent in the prior year reflecting the impact of our integrated growth strategies of 5 redcard rewards and remodel program partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories the redcard rewards program reduces category gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive 5 off on virtually all items purchased in our stores and online the remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a strongerthanaverage mix in lowerthanaverage gross margin rate product categories primarily food 

our gross margin rate was 305 percent in 2010 unchanged from prior year as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral there were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

our selling general and administrative expense rate represents sga expenses as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of costs included in sga expenses sga expenses exclude depreciation and amortization as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations which are reflected separately in our consolidated statements of operations 

sga expense rate was 201 percent in 2011 compared with 203 percent in 2010 and 205 percent in 2009 the change in the rate in 2011 was primarily due to increased charges to the us credit segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense the change in the sga expense rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales in 2011 our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 30 percent compared with 31 percent in 2010 and 32 percent in 2009

us credit card segment 

we offer credit to qualified guests through the target credit cards our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests beginning october 2010 guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a redcard at any target store or on targetcom 

credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges late fees and other revenue and third party merchant fees which are amounts received from merchants who accept the target visa credit card 

in january 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio in january 2012 we announced that we temporarily suspended our efforts to sell the receivables portfolio until later in 2012 we intend to execute a transaction only if appropriate strategic and financial conditions are met and we will classify the credit card receivables portfolio as held for sale when a transaction that allows us to meet our objectives has been agreed upon with a potential buyer 



note see note 28 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes 

a see footnote a to our us retail segment results table on page 15 for an explanation of our loyalty program charges b amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by target for 2011 2010 and 2009 these amounts exclude 3801 million 4335 million and 5484 million respectively of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables c roic is return on invested capital and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by target expressed as an annualized rate d as an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables 



a balanceweighted onemonth libor b spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor c as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables 

our primary measure of segment profit is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor 

in 2011 segment profit increased to 606 million from 541 million driven mostly by a decline in bad debt expense partially offset by lower total revenues the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were 1399 million a decrease of 205 million or 128 percent from the prior year which was primarily driven by lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue segment expenses were 721 million a decrease of 259 million or 265 percent from prior year driven by lower bad debt expense due to improved trends in key measures of risk segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables 

in 2010 segment profit increased to 541 million from 201 million driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were 1604 million a decrease of 318 million or 165 percent from the prior year which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees segment expenses were 980 million a decrease of 644 million or 397 percent from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected writeoffs segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables 



  



a writeoffs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously writtenoff balances these amounts combined represent net writeoffs 

periodend and average gross receivables have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in target visa credit card charges at thirdparties partially offset by an increase in charges at target over the past two years the decrease in charges on our credit cards at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new target visa accounts and we undertook risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higherrisk cardholders during 2009 and 2010 

we expect to report periodoverperiod declines in segment profit in 2012 primarily because our 2011 results benefited from significant allowance reductions 

canadian segment 

during 2011 startup costs totaled 74 million and primarily consisted of compensation benefits and consulting expenses these expenses are reported in sga expense within the consolidated statement of operations additionally we recorded 48 million in depreciation for 2011 related to capital lease assets and leasehold interests acquired in our zellers asset purchase 

we have begun to invest capital to prepare for site renovation establish supply chain capabilities and build supporting infrastructure 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense including interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the us credit card segment results above was 866 million for 2011 increasing 144 percent or 109 million from 2010 this increase is due to an 87 million loss on early retirement of debt 44 million of interest on canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate 

in 2010 net interest expense was 757 million decreasing 55 percent or 44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a 16 million charge related to the early retirement of longterm debt in 2009 partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 343 percent in 2011 and 351 percent in 2010 the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate this was slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in canada which are tax effected at a lower rate than the us rate various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by 85 million and 102 million respectively a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

our effective income tax rate was 351 percent in 2010 and 357 percent in 2009 the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters as noted above 

we expect a 2012 consolidated effective income tax rate of 367 percent to 377 percent excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap measures 

our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions to provide additional transparency we have disclosed nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes the impact of our 2013 canadian market entry favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt we believe this information is useful in providing periodtoperiod comparisons of the results of our us operations this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share nongaap adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis 

of our results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate nongaap adjusted eps differently than we do limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies 



note a nongaap financial measures summary is provided on page 14 the sum of the nongaap adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding 

a represents interest expense net of interest income not included in us credit card segment profit for 2011 2010 and 2009 us credit card segment profit included 72 million 83 million and 97 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables respectively these amounts along with other interest expense equal consolidated gaap interest expense b in 2011 taxes are allocated to our business segments based on income tax rates applicable to the operations of the segment for the period c for 2011 2010 and 2009 average diluted shares outstanding were 6839 million 7294 million and 7548 million respectively d represents the loss on early retirement of debt e represents the effect of resolution of income tax matters the 2011 and 2009 results also include tax effects of 32 million and 6 million respectively related to losses on early retirement of debt 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our periodend cash and cash equivalents balance was 794 million compared with 1712 million in 2010 shortterm investments highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase of 194 million and 1129 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our shortterm investments this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 

our 2011 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds cash flow provided by operations was 5434 million in 2011 compared with 5271 million in 2010 during 2011 target issued 35 billion of debt that matures between january 2013 and january 2022 this cash flow combined with our prior yearend cash position allowed us to fund capital expenditures retire outstanding debt obligations pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program during 2011 we also completed our real estate transaction with zellers this transaction resulted in a final net purchase price of 1636 million 

our 2011 periodend gross credit card receivables were 6357 million compared with 6843 million in 2010 a decrease of 71 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2011 decreased 111 percent compared with 2010 levels this change was driven by the factors indicated in the us credit card segment above 

during 2011 we retired our 2008 credit card financing with jpmorgan chase by making principal and makewhole payments totaling 3080 million as of january 28 2012 1 billion of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties we intend to pursue a sale of our credit card receivables portfolio which may provide additional liquidity in 2012 

yearend inventory levels increased 322 million or 42 percent from 2010 inventory levels were higher to support trafficdriving strategic initiatives such as our remodel program including expanded food assortment and pharmacy offerings in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage accounts payable increased by 232 million or 35 percent over the same period 

during 2011 we repurchased 372 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 1894 million 5089 per share under a 10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 in 2010 we repurchased 478 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 2508 million 5244 per share during january 2012 our board of directors authorized a 5 billion share repurchase plan we expect to begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current program we intend to complete this new program primarily through open market transactions in the next 2 to 3 years 

we paid dividends totaling 750 million in 2011 and 609 million in 2010 an increase of 231 percent we declared dividends totaling 777 million 115 per share in 2011 an increase of 178 percent over 2010 in 2010 we declared dividends totaling 659 million 092 per share an increase of 311 percent over 2009 we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs 

our ability to access the longterm debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings the ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing as of january 28 2012 our credit ratings were as follows 



if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above 

as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was 59x in 2011 61x in 2010 and 51x in 2009 

in 2011 we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued in 2010 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and longterm debt issuance 



an additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed 225 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october 2011 which will expire in october 2016 this new revolving credit facility replaced a 2 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in april 2012 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2011 or 2010 under either facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends additionally at january 28 2012 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we expect approximately 33 billion of capital expenditures in 2012 reflecting an estimated 25 billion in our us retail segment and approximately 800 million in our canadian segment we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2012 and we continue to anticipate ample access to longterm financing see the commitments and contingencies table on page 24 for detailed information on material commitments and contingencies as of january 28 2012 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 4368 million in 2011 compared with 2129 million in 2010 and 1729 million in 2009 this increase was driven by our purchase of zellers leases in canada as well as store remodels 



a see note 28 to our consolidated financial statements for capital expenditures by segment 

commitments and contingencies 

at january 28 2012 our contractual obligations were as follows 



a required principal payments only excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in longterm debt as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules b total contractual lease payments include 2894 million and 1910 million of capital lease payments and operating lease payments respectively related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised these payments also include 828 million and 171 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2012 or later for capital and operating leases respectively capital lease obligations include interest c real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities d deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees forecasted investment returns and the projected timing of future retirements e estimated tax contingencies of 318 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement f real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities g purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketingrelated contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met h we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of january 28 2012 our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for substantially all inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand customer preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 7918 million and 7596 million at january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 respectively and is further described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 589 million and 517 million at january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 respectively and is described further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables are recorded we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future writeoffs this allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other creditrelated fees we estimate future writeoffs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends substantially all pastdue accounts accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased 260 million from 690 million or 101 percent of gross credit card receivables at january 29 2011 to 430 million or 68 percent of gross credit card 

receivables at january 28 2012 credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of january 28 2012 would result in additional impairment of 6 million in 2011 historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 646 million and 628 million at january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by 32 million in 2011 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain including interest and penalties were 318 million and 397 million at january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility for and the level of these benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 51 percent 78 percent and 83 percent for the 5year 10year and 15year periods respectively benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the longterm rate of return used a one percentage point decrease in the expected longterm rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by 26 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates historically 

this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used and a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by 25 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements although we will be presenting a separate statement of comprehensive income in accordance with accounting standard update 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 beginning in 2012 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include for our us credit card segment aggregate portfolio risks and the level of the allowance for doubtful accounts anticipated segment profit and the pursuit and timing of a portfolio sale for our canadian segment our performance timing and amount of future capital investments in canada on a consolidated basis statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the continued execution of our share repurchase program and the expected duration of the approved programs our expected capital expenditures the expected effective income tax rate the expected compliance with debt covenants the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements our intentions regarding future dividends contributions related to our pension and postretirement health care plans the expected returns on pension plan assets the impact of future changes in foreign currency the effects of macroeconomic conditions the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation property loss the expected outcome of claims and litigation the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities including foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the resolution of tax matters 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floatingrate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a primebased floatingrate to manage our net interest margin we generally maintain levels of floatingrate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments at january 28 2012 the amount of floatingrate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floatingrate debt obligations by approximately 2 billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at january 28 2012 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate credit card assets and shortterm investments would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 2 million see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes 19 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january 28 2012 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by 9 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by 29 million at january 28 2012 the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged 35 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 14 and note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

our investment in canada during 2011 has exposed us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar that we were not exposed to in previous years similar foreign currency risk will exist as new target stores are opened in canada and inventory is purchased in both us and canadian dollars during 2011 gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant currently we do not have significant direct exposure to other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as all of our stores are located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in us dollars 

there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic operational compliance and financial risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our instock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margin and expenses 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margin and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions in apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target including our owned and exclusive brands 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of targets reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects on our business including consumer boycotts loss of new store development opportunities or team member recruiting difficulties 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands such as market pantry up  up target home merona and mossimo these brands generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales totaling approximately onethird of sales in 2010 if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin rate could be adversely affected 

we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

all of our stores are located within the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales these same considerations impact the success of our credit card segment deterioration in macroeconomic conditions can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to fully anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit resulting in higher bad debt expense demand for consumer credit is also impacted by consumer choices regarding payment methods and our performance could be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use debit cards or other forms of payment 

if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our results of operations could be adversely affected 

with approximately 355000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain a growing number of qualified team members many of those team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developers ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store sites are located in fully developed markets which is generally a more timeconsuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and exurban markets 

interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions increased tariffs currency exchange rates the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping at our stores altogether such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our expenses 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

given the geographic concentration of our stores natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations 

our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors changes in the tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate in addition our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due to the taxfree nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital and the assetbacked securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures 

a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in 2011 we expect to migrate our online presence targetcom from a platform currently operated by amazon inc to our own proprietary platform if this new platform does not function as designed we may experience a loss of guest confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases 

our announced plan to expand retail operations into canada could adversely affect our financial results 

our plan to enter the canadian retail market is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the united states our ability to convert the leased locations that we acquire from zellers inc to target stores depends in large measure upon our ability to negotiate acceptable modifications to existing lease terms remodel existing assets and recruit hire and retain qualified team members in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to offer a full assortment of merchandise in certain markets the effective execution of our strategy is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing and promotional programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for canada our financial performance could be adversely affected

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

our 2010 retail segment sales increased 37 percent over last year due to a 21 percent comparablestore increase combined with the contribution from new stores our retail segment ebitda and ebit increased 49 percent and 58 percent respectively compared with the prior year in the credit card segment we achieved a significant increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk 

cash flow provided by operations was 5271 million 5881 million and 4430 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we opened 13 new stores and 76 new stores in 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2010 we remodeled 341 stores significantly more than the 67 stores we remodeled in 2009 additionally during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 478 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 2508 million 5244 per share and 479 million 4854 per share respectively 

in january 2011 we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in canada currently operated by zellers inc in exchange for c1825 million canadian dollars due in two payments one in may 2011 and one in september 2011 we believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 target stores in canada primarily during 2013 we expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over c1 billion a portion of which may be funded by landlords at january 29 2011 the value of c100 approximated the value of 100 

additionally in january 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio as of january 29 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was 6843 million of which 3954 million was funded by third parties and 2889 million was funded by target refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further description of historical financing transactions related to our credit card receivables 

managements discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

analysis of results of operations 

retail segment 



ebitda is earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization 

ebit is earnings before interest expense and income taxes 

a loyalty program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our retail segment effective with the october 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5 redcard rewards loyalty program we changed the formula under which our credit card segment reimburses our retail segment to better align with the attributes of the new program these reimbursed amounts were 102 million in 2010 89 million in 2009 and 117 million in 2008 in all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to sga expenses within the retail segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the credit card segment 



retail segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns from our stores and our online business as well as gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage total sales for the retail segment for 2010 were 65786 million compared with 63435 million in 2009 and 62884 million in 2008 all periods were 52week years growth in total sales between 2010 and 2009 resulted from higher comparablestore sales and additional stores opened whereas between 2009 and 2008 growth in total sales resulted from sales from additional stores opened partially offset by lower comparablestore sales in 2010 deflation affected sales growth by approximately 02 percentage points compared with a deflationary impact of approximately 36 percentage points in 2009 and an inflationary impact of 22 percentage points in 2008 



refer to the merchandise section in item 1 business for a description of our product categories 

comparablestore sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparablestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparablestore sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

comparablestore sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year including 

• sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open • sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes comparablestore sales do not include 

• sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted or relocated within the same trade area to a supertarget store format • sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled expanded or reconstructed 

the comparablestore sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length 

in 2010 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit in 2009 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction as well as a slight decrease in the number of transactions the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 

beginning april 2010 all new qualified credit card applicants receive the target card and we no longer issue the target visa to credit card applicants existing target visa cardholders are not affected beginning october 2010 guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a redcard at any target store or on targetcom 

we monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target with the remainder of the incremental purchases on the redcards representing a shift in tender type 



since launching our new 5 redcard rewards program in october 2010 we have experienced an increase in redcard penetration redcard penetration for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 74 percent compared to 56 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 

gross margin rate 

gross margin rate represents gross margin sales less cost of sales as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales markup is the 

difference between an items cost and its retail price expressed as a percentage of its retail price factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations vendor income sourcing strategies market forces like raw material and freight costs and competitive influences markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise factors that affect markdowns include inventory management competitive influences and economic conditions 

our gross margin rate was 305 percent in 2010 unchanged from prior year as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral there were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate 

our gross margin rate was 305 percent in 2009 compared with 298 percent in 2008 our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin rate categories generally product categories of household essentials and food the impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 11 percentage point increase for 2009 this increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns the impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 04 percentage point reduction 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

our selling general and administrative sga expense rate represents sga expenses as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of costs included in sga expenses sga expenses exclude depreciation and amortization as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations which are reflected separately in our consolidated statements of operations 

sga expense rate was 203 percent in 2010 compared with 205 percent in 2009 and 204 percent in 2008 the change in the rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses the change in the sga expense rate in 2009 was primarily driven by an approximate 04 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results which was partially offset by an approximate 02 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales in 2010 our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 31 percent compared with 32 percent in 2009 and 29 percent in 2008 the rate was essentially unchanged from the same period last year in 2009 the increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that were replaced as part of our remodel program 

store data

credit card segment 

we offer credit to qualified guests through the target visa and the target card our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests beginning april 2010 all new qualified credit card applicants receive the target card and we no longer issue the target visa to credit card applicants existing target visa cardholders are not affected beginning october 2010 guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a redcard at any target store or on targetcom this new redcard rewards program replaced the existing rewards program in which account holders received an initial 10 percentoff coupon for opening the account and earned points toward a 10 percentoff coupon on subsequent purchases these changes are intended to simplify the program and to generate profitable incremental retail sales 

credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges late fees and other revenue and third party merchant fees or the amounts received from merchants who accept the target visa credit card 



a loyalty program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our retail segment effective with the october 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5 redcard rewards loyalty program we changed the formula under which our credit card segment reimburses our retail segment to better align with the attributes of the new program these reimbursed amounts were 102 million in 2010 89 million in 2009 and 117 million in 2008 in all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to sga expenses within the retail segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the credit card segment b amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by target for 2010 2009 and 2008 these amounts exclude 4335 million 5484 million and 4503 million respectively of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables c roic is return on invested capital and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by target expressed as an annualized rate d as an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables 



a balanceweighted onemonth libor b spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor c as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables 

our primary measure of segment profit in our credit card segment is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor 

effective april 2009 we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate apr applied to cardholder account balances under these terms finance charges accrue at a fixed apr if the benchmark prime rate is less than 6 if the prime rate is greater than 6 finance charges accrue at the benchmark prime rate plus a spread because the prime rate was less than 6 during 2009 the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed apr subsequent to this terms change as a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio effective january 2010 we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum apr for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate and we eliminated penalty pricing for all current or nondelinquent accounts penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time generally 12 months and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments additionally beginning in august 2010 late fee limitations went into effect that resulted in reduced late fee revenue 

in 2010 credit card segment profit increased to 541 million from 201 million driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were 1604 million a decrease of 318 million or 165 percent from the prior year which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees segment expenses were 980 million a decrease of 644 million or 397 percent from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected writeoffs segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables 

in 2009 credit card segment profit increased to 201 million from 155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance spread to libor and significantly lower funding costs the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were 1922 million a decrease of 143 million or 69 percent from the prior year the decrease in revenue was driven by a lower prime rate lower average receivables higher finance charge and latefee writeoffs and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and april 2009 segment expenses were 1624 million a decrease of 118 million or 68 percent from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses on both a dollar and rate basis segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower libor rate compared to the prior year 



  



a writeoffs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously writtenoff balances these amounts combined represent net writeoffs 

our 2010 periodend gross credit card receivables were 6843 million compared to 7982 million in 2009 a decrease of 143 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 149 percent compared with 2009 levels in response to regulatory changes and credit card industry trends we have undertaken risk management and underwriting initiatives that have reduced available credit lines for higherrisk cardholders additionally we have experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charges at thirdparties 

our 2009 periodend gross credit card receivables were 7982 million compared with 9094 million in 2008 a decrease of 122 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 40 percent compared with 2008 levels this change was driven by the tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives described above fewer new accounts being opened and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests partially offset by the impact of lower payment rates 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense which includes the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the credit card segment results above was 757 million for 2010 decreasing 55 percent or 44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a 16 million charge related to the early retirement of longterm debt in 2009 partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate of 53 percent in 2010 compared with 48 percent in 2009 in 2009 net interest expense was 801 million decreasing 75 percent or 65 million from 2008 this decline was due to a lower average portfolio interest rate of 48 percent in 2009 compared with 53 percent in 2008 partially offset by a 16 million charge related to the early retirement of longterm debt 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 351 percent in 2010 and 357 percent in 2009 the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters which reduced income tax expense by approximately 100 million 

our effective income tax rate was 357 percent in 2009 and 374 percent in 2008 the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009 compared with nondeductible losses in 2008 the 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our period end cash and cash equivalents balance was 1712 million compared with 2200 million in 2009 marketable securities of 1129 million and 1617 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009 respectively our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our marketable securities this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct shortterm instruments that mature in 60 days or less we also place certain limitations on the aggregate dollars invested and percentage of total fund value held when making shortterm investment decisions 

our 2010 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds cash flow provided by operations was 5271 million in 2010 compared with 5881 million in 2009 this cash flow combined with our prior yearend cash position and the debt issuance described below allowed us to fund capital expenditures of 2129 million and pay off 2259 million of debt in addition in 2010 we increased our share repurchases and raised dividends paid to our shareholders 

our 2010 periodend gross credit card receivables were 6843 million compared with 7982 million in 2009 a decrease of 143 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 149 percent compared with 2009 levels this change was driven by the factors indicated in the credit card segment above this trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into 2011 due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables target receivables llc tr llc formerly known as target receivables corporation trc using cash flows from the receivables repaid an affiliate of jpmorgan chase jpmc 566 million and 163 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively under the terms of our agreement with them as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to the extent the receivables balance continues to decline tr llc expects to continue to pay jpmc a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by jpmc would not exceed 47 percent 

yearend inventory levels increased 417 million or 58 percent from 2009 inventory levels were higher to support trafficdriving strategic initiatives such as our expanded food assortment in general merchandise stores and pharmacy in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage accounts payable increased by 115 million or 18 percent over the same period 

during 2010 we repurchased 478 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 2508 million 5244 per share under a 10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 in 2009 we repurchased 99 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 479 million 4854 per share 

we paid dividends totaling 609 million in 2010 and 496 million in 2009 an increase of 227 percent we declared dividends totaling 659 million 092 per share in 2010 an increase of 311 percent over 2009 in 2009 we declared dividends totaling 503 million 067 per share an increase of 68 percent over 2008 we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs as described in note 19 in july 2010 we issued 1 billion of longterm debt at 3875 that matures in july 2020 there were no amounts issued in 2009 

our ability to access the longterm debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to target in the past our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the economic environment our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings the ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing as of january 29 2011 our credit ratings were as follows 



a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc 

if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above 

as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the secs applicable rules was 61x in 2010 51x in 2009 and 43x in 2008 

at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program in past years we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued in 2010 and 2009 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and the longterm debt issuance indicated above 



an additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in april 2007 which will expire in april 2012 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2010 or 2009 under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 29 2011 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

we believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2011 including our plan to enter the canadian retail market by paying c1825 million to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites currently operated by zellers inc we may issue new longterm debt for these and other initiatives and we anticipate ample access to longterm financing further in january 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio which may provide additional funding as of january 29 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables 

portfolio was 6843 million of which 3954 million was funded by third parties and 2889 million was funded by target 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 2129 million in 2010 compared with 1729 million in 2009 and 3547 million in 2008 this increase was driven by higher capital expenditures for remodels partially offset by reduced expenditures for new stores our 2010 capital expenditures include 482 million related to stores that will open in 2011 and later years net property and equipment increased 213 million in 2010 following a decrease of 475 million in 2009 



in connection with the previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in canada we expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over c1 billion primarily during 2012 and 2013 a portion of which may be funded by landlords 

commitments and contingencies 

at january 29 2011 our contractual obligations were as follows 



a required principal payments only excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in longterm debt as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules principal includes the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to jpmc at the principal amount in the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance accelerated repayment of this obligation may occur b total contractual lease payments include 1949 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised these payments also include 28 million and 241 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2011 or later for capital and operating leases respectively capital lease obligations include interest c real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities d deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees forecasted investment returns and the projected timing of future retirements e estimated tax contingencies of 397 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement f these payments vary with libor and are calculated assuming libor of 025 percent plus a spread for each year outstanding g real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities h purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketing related contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met i in january 2011 we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in canada currently operated by zellers inc in exchange for c1825 million at january 29 2011 the value of c100 approximated the value of 100 this commitment does not include future minimum lease payments on sites that may be selected in 2011 j we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of january 29 2011 our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate 

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand customer preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was 7596 million and 7179 million at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 respectively and is further described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was 517 million and 390 million at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 respectively and is described further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables are recorded we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future writeoffs this allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other creditrelated fees we estimate future writeoffs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the 

factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations during 2010 we continued risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higherrisk cardholders in addition we experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charge activity from reductions in card usage by our guests as a result of these trends our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased 326 million from 1016 million or 127 percent of gross credit card receivables at january 30 2010 to 690 million or 101 percent of gross credit card receivables at january 29 2011 credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of january 29 2011 would result in additional impairment of approximately 12 million in 2010 historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of longlived assets 

goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value of goodwill and intangible assets growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth rates and other factors as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 we had 223 million and 239 million of goodwill and intangible assets respectively while we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets exceeds its carrying value materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or other factors could result in impairment losses 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was 628 million and 653 million at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are adequate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our selfinsurance expense by approximately 30 million in 2010 historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item 7a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain including interest and penalties were 397 million and 579 million at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility for and the level of these benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the longterm rate of return used a one percentage point decrease in the expected longterm rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately 24 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates historically this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used and a 05 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately 23 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods 

new accounting pronouncements 

recent adoptions 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 140 sfas 166 codified in the transfers and servicing accounting principles which amends the derecognition guidance in former fasb statement no 140 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying specialpurpose entities we adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r sfas 167 codified in the consolidation accounting principles which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities the amendments significantly affected the overall consolidation analysis under former fasb interpretation no 46r we adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and the adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position 

outlook 

our outlook is based on the application of business judgment in light of current business trends our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic environment and estimates of the impact of current initiatives the most significant of which are our store remodel program the new 5 percent redcard rewards program and our planned canadian expansion 

in the retail segment we expect that comparablestore sales will increase in the 4 to 5 percent range in 2011 we expect that our store remodel program will contribute incremental comparablestore sales and net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption this impact will grow to a run rate of about 15 percentage points as we progress through the year separately we expect that the sales contribution of our 5 redcard rewards program will grow more rapidly in its importance adding up to 2 percentage points to our same store sales growth later in 2011 these estimates are based on extrapolations of the current performance of these programs 

in 2011 we expect to produce a fullyear ebit margin rate consistent with 2010 due to favorable leverage of sga and depreciation and amortization expenses offsetting the gross margin rate declines associated with our store remodel and new rewards strategies this offsetting impact is unlikely to occur in the spring particularly in the first quarter resulting in modest pressure on ebit margin rate in the spring and modest favorability on this measure in the fall 

in our credit card segment we expect receivables will continue to decline in 2011 with the pace of the decline moderating as the year progresses we expect that the allowance for doubtful accounts will continue to decline in 2011 as well due to this decline in receivables and expected continued improvement in portfolio risks we also expect measures of our rate of portfolio profitability to remain strong in 2011 additionally in january 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio as of january 29 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was 6843 million of which 3954 million was funded by third parties and 2889 million was funded by target 

in january 2011 we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in canada currently operated by zellers inc in exchange for c1825 million due in two payments one in may 2011 and one in september 2011 we believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 target stores in canada primarily during 2013 we expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over c1 billion a portion of which may be funded by landlords our direct costs associated with entry into canada may add expenses equating to an earnings per share eps equivalent in the range of 010 for 2011 an estimate that will continue to evolve over time we currently believe the aggregate effect of our canadian expansion could result in a 015 to 020 unfavorable impact on 2011 eps reflecting direct incremental expenses and the indirect impact of the canadian investment on the pace of share repurchase we expect that the 2012 dilutive eps impact of the canadian expansion will exceed the 2011 dilutive eps impact due primarily to a full year of leaserelated expenses 

we expect 2011 capital expenditures related to our us retail operations to be approximately 25 billion driven primarily by a larger remodel program we expect to open 21 new stores in the us in 2011 adding approximately 15 new locations net of closings and relocations 

we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan although at a slower pace due to our canadian expansion investing in the range of 15 billion to 20 billion during 2011 the timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market conditions and the amount of future net earnings and cash flows 

we expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 37 percent 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include for our retail segment our outlook for sales comparablestore sales trends including the impact of our store remodel and 5 redcard rewards programs and ebit margin rates for our credit card segment our outlook for yearend gross credit card receivables future writeoffs of current receivables rate of portfolio 

profitability the allowance for doubtful accounts improvement in portfolio risks and the pursuit of a portfolio sale on a consolidated basis details on the expected investment in canada and its impact on our results statements regarding the adequacy of our sources of liquidity the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2011 the expected effective income tax rate the expected compliance with debt covenants our intentions regarding future dividends our expected future sharebased compensation expense our expected return on plan assets our expected expense contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental the potential impact of changes in our critical accounting estimates the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate to manage our net interest margin we generally maintain levels of floatingrate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments at january 29 2011 the amount of floatingrate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floatingrate debt obligations by approximately 2 billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at january 29 2011 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 2 million see further description in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january 29 2011 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 10 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by 25 million at january 29 2011 the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at yearend we had hedged approximately 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 14 and note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

we do not currently have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in us dollars our previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in canada will expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar beginning in 2011 

overall there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic operational compliance and financial risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our instock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margin and expenses 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margin and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions in apparel home décor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations 

our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of the target brand 

we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary 

constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects on our business including consumer boycotts loss of new store development opportunities or team member recruiting difficulties 

we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 

all of our stores are located within the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales these same considerations impact the success of our credit card segment as any deterioration can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit resulting in higher bad debt expense the recent credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 has significantly restricted our ability to make changes to cardholder terms that are commensurate with changes in the risk profile of our credit card receivables portfolio demand for consumer credit is also impacted by macroeconomic conditions and other factors and our performance can also be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use debit cards or other forms of payment 

if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our results of operations could be adversely affected 

with over 350000 team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain a growing number of qualified team members many of those team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developers ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur within fully developed markets which is generally a more timeconsuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and exurban markets 

interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions increased tariffs currency exchange rates the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise andor adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping at our stores altogether such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our expenses 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce which is not represented by unions as of the end of 2009 could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

given the geographic concentration of our stores natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations 

our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors changes in the tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate in addition our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due to the taxfree nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital and the assetbacked securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures 

a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could adversely affect our results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

our 2009 financial results in both of our business segments were affected by the challenging economy in which we operated in light of that environment performance in our retail segment was remarkable as the segment generated the highest ebit in the corporations history in a year when comparablestore sales declined 25 percent in the credit card segment disciplined management led to a 294 percent increase in segment profit in a year when targets average investment in the portfolio declined about 32 percent representing a neardoubling of segment pretax return on invested capital 

cash flow provided by operations was 5881 million 4430 million and 4125 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2009 we opened 76 new stores representing 58 stores net of 13 relocations and 5 closings in 2008 we opened 114 new stores representing 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings 

managements discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

analysis of results of operations 

retail segment 



ebitda is earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization 

ebit is earnings before interest expense and income taxes 

a new account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales our retail segment charges these discounts to our credit card segment and the reimbursements of 89 million in 2009 117 million in 2008 and 114 million in 2007 are recorded as a reduction to sga expenses within the retail segment  



retail segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns from our stores and our online business as well as gift card breakage refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage total sales for the retail segment for 2009 were 63435 million compared with 62884 million in 2008 and 61471 million in 2007 all periods were 52week years growth in total sales between 2009 and 2008 as well as between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from additional stores opened offset by lower comparablestore sales in 2009 deflation affected sales growth by approximately 

4 percentage points compared with an inflationary impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2008 and a deflationary impact of 2 percentage points in 2007 



refer to the merchandise section in item 1 business for a description of our product categories 

comparablestore sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparablestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparablestore sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

comparablestore sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and supertarget stores open longer than one year including 

• sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open • sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes comparablestore sales do not include 

• sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted or relocated within the same trade area to a supertarget store format • sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled expanded or reconstructed 



  the comparablestore sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length 

in fiscal 2009 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction in 2008 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction transactionlevel metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and comparablestore sales rates are negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores 

gross margin rate 

gross margin rate represents gross margin sales less cost of sales as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of expenses included in cost of sales markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price expressed as a percentage of its retail price factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations vendor income sourcing strategies market forces like raw material and freight costs and competitive influences markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise factors that affect markdowns include inventory management competitive influences and economic conditions 

in 2009 our gross margin rate was 305 percent compared with 298 percent in 2008 our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories partially offset by the mix impact of faster 

sales growth in lower margin rate categories generally product categories of household essentials and food the impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 11 percentage point increase for 2009 this increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns the impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 04 percentage point reduction 

in 2008 our gross margin rate was 298 percent compared with 302 percent in 2007 our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix which resulted in a 06 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories this mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment which had a combined impact on gross margin rate of an approximate 02 percentage point increase 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

our selling general and administrative sga expense rate represents sga expenses as a percentage of sales see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of expenses included in sga expenses sga expenses exclude depreciation and amortization as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations which are reflected separately in our consolidated statements of operations 

sga expense rate was 205 percent in 2009 compared with 204 percent in both 2008 and 2007 the change in the rate was primarily driven by an approximate 04 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results the rate increase was partially offset by an approximate 02 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores within sga expenses in 2008 and 2007 there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales when compared with prior periods 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales in 2009 our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 32 percent compared with 29 percent in 2008 and 27 percent in 2007 the increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that will be replaced as part of our 340store 2010 remodel program the comparative increase in 2008 was due to increased capital expenditures specifically related to investments in new stores

credit card segment 

credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges late fees and other revenue and third party merchant fees or the amounts received from merchants who accept the target visa credit card 



a new account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales our retail segment charges the cost of these discounts to our credit card segment and the reimbursements of 89 million in 2009 117 million in 2008 and 114 million in 2007 are recorded as an increase to operations and marketing expenses within the credit card segment b amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by target for 2009 2008 and 2007 these amounts exclude 5484 million 4503 million and 2387 million respectively of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables c roic is return on invested capital and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by target expressed as an annualized rate d as an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables 



a balanceweighted onemonth libor b as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables c spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor our primary measure of segment profit in our credit card segment is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor for the first quarter of 2009 the vast majority of our portfolio accrued finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate effective april 2009 we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate apr applied to cardholder account balances under these terms finance charges accrue at a fixed apr if the benchmark prime rate is less than 6 if the prime rate is greater than 6 finance charges accrue at the benchmark prime rate plus a spread because the prime rate was less than 6 during 2009 the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed apr subsequent to this terms change as a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio effective january 2010 we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum apr for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate and we eliminated penalty 

pricing for all current or nondelinquent accounts penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time generally 12 months and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments 

in 2009 credit card segment profit increased to 201 million from 155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance spread to libor and significantly lower funding costs the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were 1922 million a decrease of 143 million or 69 percent from the prior year the decrease in revenue was driven by a lower prime rate lower average receivables higher finance charge and latefee writeoffs and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and april 2009 segment expenses were 1624 million a decrease of 118 million or 68 percent from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses on both a dollar and rate basis segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower libor rate compared to the prior year 

segment profit and dollar spread to libor measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense segment revenues were 2064 million an increase of 168 million or 89 percent from the prior year driven by a 195 percent increase in average receivables on a rate basis revenue yield decreased 24 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the prime rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees this negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield segment expenses were 1742 million an increase of 776 million or 803 percent from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of 770 million the increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net writeoff rate from 59 percent in 2007 to 93 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of 440 million for anticipated future writeoffs of current receivables segment profit decreased from 163 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense the reduction in receivables owned and funded by target and the impact of a lower prime rate during 2008 



a represents charges at target including sales taxes and gift cards divided by sales which excludes sales taxes and gift cards 



a net writeoffs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges less current period principal recoveries 17 

our 2009 periodend gross credit card receivables were 7982 million compared with 9094 million in 2008 a decrease of 122 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 40 percent compared with 2008 levels this change was driven by tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives that have significantly reduced available credit lines for higherrisk cardholders fewer new accounts being opened and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests partially offset by the impact of a decline in payment rates 

our 2008 periodend gross credit card receivables were 9094 million compared with 8624 million in 2007 an increase of 54 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2008 increased 195 percent compared with 2007 levels this growth was driven by the annualization of the prior years product change from proprietary target cards to higherlimit target visa cards and the impact of industrywide declines in payment rates offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk cardholders 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense was 801 million at the end of 2009 decreasing 75 percent or 65 million from 2008 this decline was due to a decrease in the annualized average portfolio interest rate from 53 percent to 48 percent partially offset by a 16 million charge related to the early retirement of longterm debt in 2008 net interest expense was 866 million compared with 647 million in 2007 an increase of 338 percent this increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment share repurchase and the receivables portfolio partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 357 percent in 2009 and 374 percent in 2008 the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009 compared with nondeductible losses in 2008 the 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items 

our effective income tax rate for 2008 was 374 percent compared with 384 percent in 2007 the decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues the 2008 effective income tax rate was also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions these rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans gains and losses from these investments are not taxable 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our 2009 operations were entirely funded by internally generated funds cash flow provided by operations was 5881 in 2009 compared with 4430 million in 2008 this strong cash flow allowed us to fund capital expenditures of 1729 million and pay off 13 billion of maturing debt with internally generated funds in addition we accelerated the payoff of a 550 million 2010 debt maturity restarted our share repurchase program earlier than expected and experienced a 13 billion increase in marketable securities at january 30 2010 

our 2009 periodend gross credit card receivables were 7982 million compared with 9094 million in 2008 a decrease of 122 percent average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 40 percent compared with 2008 levels this change was driven by the factors indicated in the credit card segment above this trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into 2010 due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables target receivables corporation trc using cash flows from the receivables repaid an affiliate of jpmorgan chase jpmc 163 million during 2009 under the terms of our agreement with them as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to the extent the receivables balance continues to decline trc expects to continue to pay jpmc a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by jpmc would not exceed 47 percent 

yearend inventory levels increased 474 million or 71 percent from 2008 primarily due to unusually low inventory levels at the end of 2008 in response to the challenging economic environment inventory levels were also higher to support trafficdriving strategic initiatives such as food and pharmacy in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage accounts payable increased by 174 million or 27 percent over the same period 

during 2009 we repurchased 99 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 479 million 4854 per share under a 10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 in 2008 we repurchased 672 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 3395 million 5049 per share 

we paid dividends totaling 496 million in 2009 and 465 million in 2008 an increase of 67 percent we declared dividends totaling 503 million 067 per share in 2009 an increase of 68 percent over 2008 in 2008 we declared dividends totaling 471 million 062 per share an increase of 38 percent over 2007 we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs 

maintaining strong investmentgrade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy our current debt ratings are as follows 



a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc at january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program in past years we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued in 2009 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds additionally and as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during 2008 we sold to jpmc an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately 38 billion we received proceeds of approximately 36 billion reflecting a 7 percent discount 

an additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in april 2007 which will expire in april 2012 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2009 or 2008 under this facility 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 30 2010 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the secs applicable rules was 51x in 2009 43x in 2008 and 64x in 2007 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 1729 million in 2009 compared with 3547 million in 2008 and 4369 million in 2007 this decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores remodels and technologyrelated assets our 2009 capital expenditures include 232 million related to stores that will open in 2010 and 

later years net property and equipment decreased 475 million in 2009 following an increase of 1661 million in 2008 



commitments and contingencies 

at january 30 2010 our contractual obligations were as follows 



a required principal payments only excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in longterm debt as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules principal amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to jpmc at the principal amount in the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance accelerated repayment of this obligation may occur b these payments vary with libor and are calculated assuming libor of 025 percent plus a spread for each year outstanding c total contractual lease payments include 2016 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised these payments also include 196 million and 88 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2010 or later for capital and operating leases respectively capital lease obligations include interest refer to note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of leases d estimated tax contingencies of 579 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketingrelated contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts 

we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation 

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate further information on these plans including our expected contributions for 2010 is included in note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand customer preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory is further described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter vendor income is described further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables are recorded we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future writeoffs this allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other creditrelated fees we estimate future writeoffs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations credit card receivables are described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

analysis of longlived and intangible assets for impairment we review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows usually at the store level on an annual basis or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss on a longlived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounting future cash flows this test is performed at least annually or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the 

carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable impairment on longlived assets of 49 million in 2009 2 million in 2008 and 7 million in 2007 were recorded as a result of the tests performed 

our estimates of future cash flows require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results real estate values and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted we believe that the amounts accrued are adequate although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided refer to item 7a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility for and the level of these benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the longterm rate of return used and a 01 percent decrease in the expected longterm rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately 2 million 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities historically this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used and a 01 percent decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately 4 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

future adoptions 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 140 sfas 166 codified in the transfers and servicing accounting principles which amends the derecognition guidance in former fasb statement no 140 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying specialpurpose entities this guidance will be effective for the 

corporation beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r sfas 167 codified in the consolidation accounting principles which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities the amendments will significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis under former fasb interpretation no 46r this guidance will be effective for the corporation beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position 

outlook 

in the retail segment we expect to generate increases in comparablestore sales likely in the range of 2 to 4 percent for the year including an expected 1 percentage point lift from our remodel program while our comparablestore sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall the expected incremental sales resulting from remodels will grow as the year progresses additionally we expect total sales to increase by a midsingle digit percentage 

in 2010 we expect to generally preserve our 2009 ebit margin rate in our retail segment which if achieved would result in our retail segment ebit increasing in line with total sales growth 

in our credit card segment we expect the lower consumer usage of credit and our risk management strategies to continue throughout 2010 resulting in a low doubledigit percentage decline in gross credit card receivables by the end of the year we also expect to maintain segment profit on a dollar basis at generally the level earned in 2009 generating a higher pretax segment roic in 2010 than in 2009 

we expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our longterm structural rate likely in the range of 370 to 375 percent 

we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization 

we expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of 2 to 25 billion reflective of projects we will complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for our 2011 and 2012 new store programs our expectation is that our 2010 new store program will result in approximately 13 new stores and that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores 

due to the early repayment of an august 2010 debt maturity the only significant remaining 2010 maturity prior to our seasonal working capital peak which typically occurs in october or november is the 900 million public series borrowing collateralized by our credit card receivables due in october 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include for our retail segment our outlook for sales expected merchandise returns comparablestore sales trends and ebit margin rates for our credit card segment our outlook for yearend gross credit card receivables portfolio size future writeoffs of current receivables profit roic and the allowance for doubtful accounts on a consolidated basis the expected effective income tax rate the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2010 and 2011 the expected compliance with debt covenants our intentions regarding future dividends the anticipated impact of new accounting pronouncements our expected future sharebased compensation expense our expected contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a primebased floating rate to manage our net interest margin we generally maintain levels of floatingrate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments at january 30 2010 the amount of floatingrate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floatingrate debt obligations by approximately 1 billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at january 30 2010 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 1 million see further description in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january 30 2010 the annualized effect of a 05 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 9 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by 22 million at january 30 2010 the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 14 and note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

we do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in us dollars 

overall there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests and a brand they trust meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various operational and financial risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

our success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers 

the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores and our instock levels are also factors in our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margin and expenses if we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margin and profitability could suffer 

a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions in apparel home décor seasonal offerings and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to lost sales increased markdowns on inventory and adversely affect our results of operations 

all of our stores are located within the united states making us highly susceptible to deteriorations in us macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence 

all of our stores are located within the united states making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states the success of our credit card business is also highly dependent on consumers willingness to use credit cards over other payment methods their ability to pay and our ability to anticipate changes to the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively impact our business in many ways including 

• slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales • reducing gross margins • increasing our expenses including bad debt expense 4 

if we do not continually attract train and retain qualified employees our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members many of those team members are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels health care costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer and we could experience delays in opening new stores those factors together with increased wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

inability to build new stores in suitable locations could slow our growth and difficulty in building new stores could increase our costs and capital requirements 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developers ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing and expanding our stores a significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur within fully developed markets which is generally a more timeconsuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and exurban markets delays in new store openings could have an adverse effect on our sales growth and increased costs associated with new stores and store expansions could adversely affect our results of operations 

interruptions in our supply chain could adversely affect our results 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security or other events that could slow port activities and impact foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and adversely affect our results of operations 

product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 

if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products decline to use our pharmacy 

services or stop shopping at our stores altogether such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in federal state or local laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce none of which is represented by unions as of the end of 2008 could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employers obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition certain aspects of our business such as our pharmacy and credit card operations are more heavily regulated than other areas changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

given the geographic concentration of our stores natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations 

our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors including statutory tax rates the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and due to the method by which we economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities changes in capital market returns changes in the tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate in addition our effective income tax rate bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due principally to our use of companyowned life insurance as an investment vehicle to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 

if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer 

we are dependent on a stable liquid and wellfunctioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital and the assetbacked securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures

sec rule sk item 103 requires that companies disclose environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority when such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions of 100000 or more 

we are a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by the california attorney general in october 2008 alleging that we sold certain products that contained volatile organic compounds in excess of regulated limits windshield washer fluid and air fresheners and other products that were not approved for sale in california gas cans and gas generators the case is in its early stages and settlement discussions are continuing we anticipate that any resolution of this matter is likely to exceed 100000 but will not be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we are one of many defendants in a lawsuit filed on february 13 2008 by the state of california involving environmental matters that may involve potential monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 the allegation initially made by the california air resources board in april 2006 involves a nonfood product hairspray that allegedly contained levels of a volatile organic compound in excess of permissible levels we anticipate that the settlement to be fully indemnified by the vendor is likely to exceed 100000 but will not be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of adverse economic conditions on our business segments our retail segment results were affected by changes in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted our traffic and sales particularly in higher margin discretionary categories creating an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales our credit card segment performance like that of other credit card issuers was adversely affected by the deteriorating credit and risk environment as a result we incurred higherthanexpected bad debt expense as we both wroteoff accounts and added significantly to our allowance for doubtful accounts in light of this challenging retail and credit environment we have suspended our share repurchase program and reduced spending on new store construction and remodels 

sales totaled 62884 million in 2008 61471 million in 2007 and 57878 million in 2006 increasing 23 percent in 2008 and 62 percent in 2007 comparablestore sales as defined below in 2008 declined 29 percent from 2007 comparablestore sales in 2007 grew 30 percent from 2006 credit card revenues were 2064 million 1896 million and 1612 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively increasing 89 percent in 2008 and 176 percent in 2007 the combination of retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of 4402 million in 2008 5272 million in 2007 and 5069 million in 2006 decreasing 165 percent in 2008 and increasing 40 percent in 2007 cash flow provided by operations was 4430 million 4125 million and 4862 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively additionally we paid dividends of 465 million in 2008 442 million in 2007 and 380 million in 2006 we opened 114 new stores in 2008 or 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings in 2007 we opened 118 new stores representing 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing

ebit is earnings before interest expense and income taxes 

a new account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales our retail segment charges these discounts to our credit card segment and the reimbursements of 117 million in 2008 114 million in 2007 and 109 million in 2006 are recorded as a reduction to sga expenses within the retail segment 

retail segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales 

sales 

sales include merchandise sales net of expected returns from our stores and our online business as well as gift card breakage refer to note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage total sales for the retail segment for the 2008 year were 62884 million compared with 61471 million in 2007 and 57878 million in 2006 the 2008 and 2007 periods were 52week years compared to the 2006 period that was a 53week year growth in total sales between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from stores opened in 2008 offset by lower comparablestore sales the increase in total sales between 2007 and 2006 is attributable to both new stores and comparablestore sales increases in 2008 inflation affected sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points compared with a deflationary impact of 2 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006 



comparablestore sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable prioryear period of equivalent length the method of calculating comparablestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparablestore sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies additionally beginning in 2007 we changed our comparablestore sales calculation to include sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated multichannel approach to our business 

comparablestore sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and supertarget stores open longer than one year including 

• sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open • sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes comparablestore sales do not include 

• sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted or relocated within the same trade area to a supertarget store format • sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled expanded or reconstructed 

  the comparablestore sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length 

in 2008 the change in comparablestore sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction in fiscal 2007 the comparable store sales increase was driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount when compared to 2006 with both the number of units and selling price per unit sold each representing roughly half of the increase attributable to average transaction amount transactionlevel metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors and comparablestore sales rates is negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores 

gross margin rate 

gross margin rate represents gross margin sales less cost of sales as a percentage of sales see note 3 for a description of expenses included in cost of sales markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price expressed as a percentage of its retail price factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations vendor income sourcing strategies market forces like raw material and freight costs and competitive influences markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise factors that affect markdowns include inventory management competitive influences and economic conditions 

in 2008 our consolidated gross margin rate was 298 percent compared with 302 percent in 2007 our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix which resulted in a 06 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates generally nondiscretionary product categories of consumables and commodities outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories this mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment which had a combined favorable impact on gross margin rate of approximately 02 percentage point 

in 2007 our consolidated gross margin rate was consistent with the 2006 gross margin rate our gross margin rate for 2007 benefited from higher margin rates within merchandise categories substantially all of this benefit was offset by the adverse effects from sales of lower margin merchandise categories outpacing sales of higher margin merchandise categories during 2007 rate improvement within categories was driven generally by an array of inventory control initiatives that minimized markdowns 

selling general and administrative expense rate 

our selling general and administrative sga expense rate represents sga expenses as a percentage of sales see note 3 for a description of expenses included in sga expenses sga expenses exclude depreciation and amortization as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations which are reflected separately in our consolidated statements of operations 

sga expense rate was 204 percent in 2008 which was the same as 2007 and consistent with 203 percent in 2006 within sga expenses in 2008 and 2007 there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales when compared to prior periods these expense rates reflect sustained productivity gains in our stores and disciplined expense control across the corporation 

depreciation and amortization expense rate 

our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales in 2008 our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 29 percent compared with 27 percent in 2007 and 26 percent in 2006 the comparative increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to increased capital expenditures specifically related to investments in new stores during 2006 we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 28 million

credit card segment 

credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges late fees and other revenues and third party merchant fees or the amounts received from merchants who accept the target visa credit card 



a new account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales our retail segment charges these discounts to our credit card segment and the reimbursements of 117 million in 2008 114 million in 2007 and 109 million in 2006 are recorded as an increase to operations and marketing expenses within the credit card segment b amounts represent the portion of average credit card receivables funded by target for 2008 2007 and 2006 these amounts exclude 4503 million 2387 million and 1782 million respectively of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables c roic is return on invested capital and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average receivables funded by target expressed as an annualized rate d as an annualized percentage of average receivables 

a balanceweighted onemonth libor b as a percentage of average receivables c spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the vast majority of our portfolio earns finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor our primary measure of profitability in our credit card segment is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital target has invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the vast majority of our portfolio accrues finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor 

segment profit and dollar spread to libor measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense segment revenues were 2064 million an increase of 168 million or 89 percent from the prior year driven by a 195 percent increase in average receivables on a rate basis 

revenue yield decreased 24 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the prime rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees this negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield segment expenses were 1742 million an increase of 776 million or 803 percent from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of 770 million the increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net writeoff rate from 59 percent in 2007 to 93 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of 440 million for anticipated future writeoffs of current receivables segment profit decreased from 163 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense the reduction in receivables owned and funded by target and the impact of a lower prime rate during 2008 

2007 segment revenues were 1896 million an increase of 284 million or 176 percent from the prior year driven by a higher average receivables balance the annualized rates for the components of segment revenue were consistent with prior periods segment expenses were 966 million an increase of 136 million or 164 percent from 2006 this increase was due to bad debt expense in 2007 which rose reflecting an increase in net writeoffs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of higher expected future losses on periodend receivables segment roic benefited from a slightly higher percentage of third party funding of our credit card receivables 

we implemented a terms change to our portfolio effective in april 2009 that establishes a minimum annual percentage rate apr applied to a receivables balance as a finance charge under this terms change finance charges will accrue at a fixed apr if the benchmark prime rate is less than a threshold amount if the prime rate is greater than the threshold finance charges will accrue at the benchmark prime rate plus a spread 





a net writeoffs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges less current period principal recoveries our 2008 periodend gross receivables were 9094 million compared with 8624 million in 2007 an increase of 54 percent average receivables in 2008 increased 195 percent compared with 2007 levels this growth was driven by the annualization of the prior years product change from proprietary target cards to higherlimit target visa cards and the impact of industrywide declines in payment rates offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk guests 

2007 periodend receivables were 8624 million compared with 6711 million in 2006 an increase of 285 percent average receivables in 2007 increased 181 percent to 7275 million from 6161 million this growth in receivables measure was driven primarily by a product change from proprietary target cards to target visa cards for a group of higher creditquality target card guests a product change to a target visa card generally results in a higher receivables balance because it can be used for purchases outside of target stores and has a higher credit limit accounts converted from a target card to a target visa accounted for approximately 20 percentage points of the growth in periodend receivables the remainder of our yearoveryear receivables growth was primarily due to a reduction in payment rates on nonconverted accounts 

other performance factors 

net interest expense 

net interest expense was 866 million at the end of 2008 increasing 338 percent or 219 million from 2007 this increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment share repurchase and the receivables portfolio partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate in 2007 net interest expense was 647 million compared with 572 million in 2006 an increase of 132 percent this increase related to higher average debt balances including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable the average portfolio interest rate was 53 percent in 2008 61 percent in 2007 and 62 percent in 2006 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 374 percent in 2008 384 percent in 2007 and 380 percent in 2006 the decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues the 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions these rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans gains and losses from these investments are not taxable the increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to lower capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006 

workforce reduction 

in 2008 we recorded a 47 million charge related to workforce reduction actions approximately 21 million of which related to actions announced in january 2009 affecting our headquarters population this charge was comprised of severance and benefit costs of 37 million and other expenses primarily early lease exit costs of 10 million at the end of 2008 the remaining liability balance relating to severance costs was approximately 31 million we believe that the liability will be substantially extinguished by the end of the first quarter of 2009 the liability is recorded as a component of other current liabilities and the expenses are recorded as a component of sga 

we will incur costs in 2009 for workforce reduction actions announced in 2008 but where team members are required to provide future services we estimate those costs will be approximately 11 million and generally represent severance and benefits costs to be paid during 2009 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to fund our operations and growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing cash flow provided by operations was 4430 million in 2008 compared with 4125 million in 2007 

our 2008 periodend gross receivables were 9094 million compared with 8624 million in 2007 an increase of 54 percent average receivables in 2008 increased 195 percent compared with 2007 levels this growth was driven by the annualization of the prior years product change from proprietary target cards to higherlimit target visa cards and the impact of industrywide declines in payment rates offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly 

reduced credit lines and from notable reductions in card usage as further described in note 10 we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a jpmorgan chase affiliate jpmc the interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction 

yearend inventory levels decreased 75 million or 11 percent from 2007 reflecting inventory management initiatives responding to declining consumer demand offset by increased inventory levels required to support comparatively higher retail square footage accounts payable decreased by 57 percent over the same period 

during 2008 we repurchased 672 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 3395 million 5049 per share under a 10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in november 2007 in 2007 we repurchased 462 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of 2642 million 5724 per share in november 2008 we announced that in light of our business outlook we were temporarily suspending our openmarket share repurchase program 

we declared dividends totaling 471 million 062 per share in 2008 an increase of 38 percent over 2007 in 2007 we declared dividends totaling 454 million 054 per share an increase of 146 percent over 2006 we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 

our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs 

maintaining strong investmentgrade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy our current debt ratings are as follows 



a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc at january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program we fund our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and typically use the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued additionally and as described in note 10 we sold to jpmc an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately 38 billion we received proceeds of approximately 36 billion reflecting a 7 percent discount 

an additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in april 2007 which will expire in april 2012 no balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities 

most of our longterm debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january 31 2009 no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our longterm debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our longterm debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade 

our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the secs applicable rules was 43x in 2008 64x in 2007 and 71x in 2006 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 3547 million in 2008 compared with 4369 million in 2007 and 3928 million in 2006 this decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores remodels and technologyrelated assets our 2008 capital expenditures include 1258 million related to stores that will 

open in 2009 and later years net property and equipment increased 1661 million in 2008 following an increase of 2664 million in 2007 



commitments and contingencies 

at january 31 2009 our contractual obligations were as follows 



a required principal payments only excludes statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fair market value adjustments recorded in longterm debt principal amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to jpmc at the principal amount b these payments vary with libor and are calculated assuming libor of 05 percent plus a spread for each year outstanding c total contractual lease payments include 1830 million of lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes 164 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2009 or later refer to note 21 for a further description of leases d estimated tax contingencies of 447 million including interest and penalties are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketingrelated contracts software acquisitionlicense commitments and service contracts 

we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation 

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate further information on these plans including our expected contributions for 2009 is included in note 27 

we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the lastin firstout lifo method as determined by applying a costtoretail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than six months inventory is further described in note 11 

vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendorsponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned the majority of all yearend vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter vendor income is described further in note 4 

allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables are recorded we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future writeoffs this allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other creditrelated fees we estimate future writeoffs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations we believe that the allowance recorded at january 31 2009 is sufficient to cover currently anticipated losses credit card receivables are described in note 10 

analysis of longlived and intangible assets for impairment we review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows usually at the store level an impairment loss on a longlived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounted future cash flows no material impairments were recorded in 2008 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed 

insuranceselfinsurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we estimate 

our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted we believe that the amounts accrued are adequate although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks refer to item 7a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies 

income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note 22 

pension and postretirement health care accounting we fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility for and the level of these benefits varies depending on team members fulltime or parttime status date of hire andor length of service 

our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions 

the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities historically this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and postretirement health care expense for the following plan year effective february 4 2007 we adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in note 27 benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used and a 01 percent increase to the weighted average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately 4 million 

based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorterservice pensioneligible team members than it does for older longerservice pensioneligible team members 

pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 27 

new accounting pronouncements 

2008 adoptions

outlook for fiscal year 2009 

we anticipate that the challenging economic and consumer environment we experienced in 2008 will continue into 2009 in the first half of 2009 in our retail segment we expect a continuation of recent sales trends – specifically midsingle digit declines in overall comparablestore sales with stronger growth in our lowermargin nondiscretionary categories than in our highermargin home and apparel categories this sales performance will likely lead to a moderate decline in our gross margin rate because it is unlikely that we will be able to offset the impact of the adverse sales mix with rate improvements within categories even in light of continued strong expense control we expect a moderate deleveraging in our sga expense rate as a result of our expectation for soft comparable store sales as a result we expect to generate ebitda and ebit in our retail segment below last years levels for the first half of the year 

in our credit card segment we expect net writeoffs to stabilize in the range of 300 million in each of the first two quarters of 2009 levels which were anticipated in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of fiscal 2008 we do not anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future especially in light of the high likelihood that we will experience modest decreases in gross receivables overall we expect to generate moderate rates of profit in the credit card segment in the first two quarters of 2009 though it is not likely to be as strong as the profits generated in the first two quarters of 2008 

in light of the current environment we are being very deliberate in the management and application of cash resources this means that we have planned for fewer stores to open in 2009 particularly in our october cycle than we would have in a more robust environment specifically we expect to open about 75 stores in 2009 or about 60 stores net of rebuilds and relocations based on these store opening expectations our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over 2 billion with the possibility that it might be as high as 25 billion if we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that lead us to approve incremental store openings in 2010 and beyond 

we expect to again generate more than 4 billion in cash from operations in 2009 which in light of our current suspension of substantially all share repurchase activity would provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments pay dividends on our common stock and fund the 13 billion of debt that is maturing in 2009 all without the need to access the term debt capital markets during the year 

our expectation is for earnings per share diluted in the first two quarters of 2009 to be well below 2008 levels in line with our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008 whether our performance will improve in the 

last two quarters of 2009 will depend on the extent to which economic conditions improve and in turn to what extent our retail segment sales improve and to a lesser degree when and to what extent we begin to experience clear and measurable benefits of recent risk management efforts in the credit card segment 

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains forwardlooking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forwardlooking statements in this report include the expected earnings per share diluted for the first two quarters of 2009 for our retail segment our outlook for sales trends gross margin rates sga expense rate and ebitda and ebit for our credit card segment our outlook for future writeoffs of current receivables profit and the allowance for doubtful accounts the expected cash generated from operations in 2009 our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2009 the expected compliance with debt covenants and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation property loss team member medical and dental claims workforce reduction costs the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties 

all such forwardlooking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forwardlooking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item 1a to this form 10k which should be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a liborplus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a primebased floating rate to manage our net interest margin we generally maintain levels of floatingrate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate our degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments at january 31 2009 our level of floatingrate credit card assets exceeded our level of net floatingrate debt obligations by approximately 13 billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at january 31 2009 the annualized effect of a half percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 7 million see further description in note 20 

we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically and in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january 31 2009 the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately 19 million 

in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by 18 million at january 31 2009 the resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold highquality longduration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 

as more fully described in note 14 and note 26 we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 

we do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in us dollars 

overall there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year
