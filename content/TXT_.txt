us government contracts and other governmental regulation 

our operations products and services are subject to various government regulations including regulations related to us government business international regulation of aviation products and services and environmental regulations 

contracts with the us government including contracts under the us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program generated approximately 26 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 primarily in our bell and textron systems segments we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified and covered defense information and the export of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones can significantly increase our costs reducing our profitability 

our contracts with the us government generally may be terminated by the us government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract if the us government terminates a contract for convenience we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination including if applicable reasonable profit on such work as well as reasonable termination costs if however the us government terminates a contract for default generally a we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered an agreedupon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the us government b the us government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract c the us government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the “feeforservice” contracts and d we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source see aerospace and defense industry section in item 1a risk factors for additional information related to regulation of us government business herein

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business is being adversely impacted and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

our businesses have experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the covid19 pandemic the effects of covid19 have included and could continue to include disruption of the operation or temporary closure of certain of our facilities or the facilities of our customers suppliers or business partners as well as other disruptions in our supply chains or our customers’ supply chains particularly in the supply chains serving our recreational vehicle products and in our automotive oem supply chains disruptions in which have caused and may continue to cause reduced demand for our automotive products we have experienced and may continue to experience lower revenues andor increased costs as a result of these business and production disruptions 

economic and other impacts from the pandemic initially resulted in and could again result in reduced demand for our aviation and commercial helicopter products and services the delay or cancellation of existing orders by our customers and lower flight hours and consequently lower demand for parts and maintenance in addition new regulations by us or foreign governments and government agencies addressed to the aviation or travel industry could impose additional regulatory aircraft security travel restrictions or other requirements or restrictions related to the pandemic that could adversely impact demand for aircraft and rotorcraft or significantly reduce hours flown resulting in a reduction in revenues andor increased costs 

the extent to which the pandemic could continue to impact our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and also will depend on future developments most of which are outside our control such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the emergence of variants of the virus that cause severe illness andor are resistant to the developed vaccines the development of and access to effective treatments the acceptance of and access to effective vaccines and the effects of actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak 

see also risks related to our finance segment under financial risks section below 

aerospace and defense industry risks 

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast unexpected events such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted demand for our aircraft products and may continue to do so therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions has in the past caused and in the future may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled deferred or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2021 we derived approximately 26 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the us government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than fullyear appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and in the future may result in a loss of anticipated revenues a loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending as well as the potential impact of sequestration could affect the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

us government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity can significantly increase our costs reducing our profitability our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the us government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract withhold cash on contract payments and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture or reduction of profits suspension or reduction of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

the use of certain contract award types by the us government increases pricing pressure and cost 

the us government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types including indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity other transaction agreements and multiaward contracts which have the potential to create increased pricing pressure as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids or share in costs in addition multiaward contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to compete for task orders and delivery orders under the contract further the competitive bidding process is costly and demands employee and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors even if we are successful in obtaining an award we may encounter bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards bid protests could result in significant expenses associated with justifying the selection or due to potential program delays and could result in contract modifications that alter schedule or scope or even cause the loss of the contract award even when a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award the resolution could postpone commencement of contract activity resulting in additional cost and delay in the recognition of revenue and profit 

our profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs  

under fixedprice contracts generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations additionally fixedprice contracts generally require progress payments rather than performancebased payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows under fixedprice incentive contracts we share with the us government cost underrun savings which are derived from total cost being less than target costs we also share in cost overruns which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs due to the nature of our work under government contracts we sometimes experience unforeseen technological or schedule difficulties and cost overruns under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates 

are incorrect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

the market for us government defense business is highly competitive which may affect our ability to win new contracts for major government programs and result in reduced future revenues 

our defense businesses operate in highly competitive markets in which they participate in rigorous increasingly competitive bidding processes against other defense companies for us government business the competitive bidding process is costly and in some instances may require significant research and development andor engineering efforts to participate despite our best efforts the us government customer may choose competitive offerings over our offerings the competition from other government contractors combined with the increasingly competitive nature of the government contract bidding and award process results in an intensely competitive market environment in which there can be no assurance that our businesses will be selected for government programs with significant longterm revenues if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or do not win government programs with significant longterm revenues we may experience declines in future revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and or cash flows 

strategic risks 

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete and the market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate 

a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future contracts for our us government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts a substantial change to schedule a material change in an anticipated market or the failure of our products or services to achieve customer acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that in some cases have resulted and in the future could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses 

business and operational risks 

our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other disruptions 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes as a us defense contractor we face persistent security threats including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing  malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources 

we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risknetwork protection mitigation plans and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure additionally we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks further our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident 

while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated and we may not always be successful in timely detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents future attacks or breaches of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information exposing us to liability or regulatory action such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources increase costs that may not be covered by insurance and result in reputational damage potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers in addition our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations for example certain of our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by suppliers which were unable to perform as anticipated due to impacts of the pandemic the risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business 

during 2021 we derived approximately 31 of our revenues from international business including us exports conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries risks related to international operations include import export economic sanctions and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against us goods impacts related to the voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit restrictions on 

technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges compliance with increasingly rigorous data privacy and protection laws competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

natural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

natural disasters including hurricanes fires tornados floods and other forms of severe weather the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change other impacts of climate change such as rising sea waters as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics power outages and industrial accidents have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business any of these events could result in physical damage to andor complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities temporary or longterm disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events the occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial risks 

if our finance segment has difficulty collecting on its finance receivables our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions such as the recent deterioration of the economy due to the impact from the covid19 pandemic as a result of the pandemic our finance segment modified a significant number of the loans in its portfolio in order to provide temporary payment relief to its customers and has provided extended payment relief to certain customers while a majority of these modified loans have returned to paying status our ultimate recovery on these assets could be delayed or impacted in addition a substantial number of the originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in the event of borrower default which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting on its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods software and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines we also may voluntarily take such action and from time to time have done so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future 

increased regulation and stakeholder expectations related to global climate change could negatively affect our operating results 

increased worldwide public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted and is likely to continue to result in more legislative and regulatory efforts to address the negative impacts of climate change such laws and regulations may include more restrictive or expansive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions by our facilities or our products that produce carbon emissions more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics andor other compliance requirements because the impact of any future climate changerelated legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards we are unable to predict their potential impact at this time moreover our investors customers employees and other stakeholders increasingly expect us to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated by our operations and our products and publicly report our plans and progress on these efforts laws and regulations addressing climate change and our efforts to meet the expectations of our stakeholders could lead to the necessity of additional investment in product development changes to our manufacturing processes sourcing from new suppliers changes to our facilities andor equipment and greater internal resources all of which could increase our costs and negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims are from time to time asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties can be costly infringement claims also have resulted in legal restrictions on our businesses engaging in sales of allegedly infringing products if such a restriction were imposed upon a material product line our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats 

risks related to human capital 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to hire and retain a qualified workforce 

our success is highly dependent upon our ability to hire and retain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to develop and manufacture the products desired by our customers we need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including among others engineering manufacturing information technology cybersecurity flight operations business development and strategy and management because many of our businesses experience cyclical demand they face challenges in maintaining their workforce at levels appropriate to market demand which in the past has necessitated workforce reductions at some of our businesses as demand decreased conversely our businesses sometimes need to increase the size of their workforce in order to keep pace with production needs due to increased customer demand furthermore for our defense businesses the uncertainty of being awarded followon contracts and the related timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 

in addition from time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures and some of our most experienced employees are retirementeligible which may adversely impact retention to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise it is critical for us to develop other employees hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge competition for skilled employees is intense and we may incur higher labor recruiting andor training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills we may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7000 or 27 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result from time to time we experience work stoppages which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers loss or delay of revenues andor increased cost the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

overview 

in 2021 textron’s revenues increased 6 and segment profit increased 51 compared with 2020 reflecting higher volume and pricing along with performance improvements higher earnings and working capital improvements during the year resulted in a yearoveryear increase of 636 million in net cash flows from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses while most of our commercial businesses have not yet returned to 2019 prepandemic levels we experienced a rebound in customer demand in these businesses during 2021 customer demand for our textron aviation aircraft products in particular increased throughout the year enabling the business to return to a more normalized and efficient manufacturing cadence and resulted in a 25 billion 157 increase in backlog during the year we have been impacted by ongoing pandemicrelated global supply chain shortages and delays as well as inflation primarily in the industrial segment and we continue to manage through these challenges 

key financial highlights for 2021 include 

• generated 15 billion of net cash from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses

consolidated results of operations 



revenues 

revenues increased 731 million 6 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily at the textron aviation and industrial segments textron aviation revenues were higher by 592 million largely due to higher citation jet volume of 330 million and higher aftermarket volume of 204 million revenues at industrial were higher by 130 million largely due to a favorable impact of 142 million from pricing principally in the specialized vehicles product line 

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

cost of sales includes cost of products and services sold for the manufacturing group in 2021 cost of sales increased 203 million 2 compared with 2020 largely due to higher net volume and mix described above and an unfavorable impact from inflation of 117 million principally reflecting higher material costs in the industrial segment these increases were partially offset by the impact of costs incurred in 2020 including idle facility costs of 142 million primarily at the textron aviation segment and a 55 million inventory charge related to the tru canada business discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased 350 basis points in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher margin at the textron aviation segment reflecting the impact of higher product sales

income taxes 



in 2021 the effective tax rate of 144 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits which included a 12 million benefit recognized for additional credits related to prior years in 2020 the effective tax rate of 96 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to an audit settlement with respect to certain state income tax returns that resulted in a 52 million benefit and the favorable impact of research and development credits 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

bell’s backlog decreased 15 billion 28 in 2021 primarily as a result of revenues recognized on our us government contracts in excess of new contracts received 

textron systems 



textron systems revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2021 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 



revenues at textron systems decreased 40 million 3 in 2021 compared with 2020 lower volume of 16 million included a 79 million decrease from our feeforservice contracts primarily reflecting the impact from the us army’s withdrawal from afghanistan partially offset by higher volume at atac of 69 million primarily from increased demand for its military tactical air services the other decrease of 24 million in the table above included the impact of a 28 million reduction in revenues as a result of the cessation of manufacturing at the tru simulation  training canada inc tru canada facility which occurred in the second quarter of 2020 related to the impact of the pandemic on that business in january 2021 we sold tru canada as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

textron systems’ operating expenses decreased 77 million 7 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily related to the cessation of manufacturing at tru canada and lower net volume described above

textron systems’ segment profit increased 37 million 24 in 2021 compared with 2020 due to a favorable impact from performance and other which included a 19 million impact from tru canada related to unfavorable performance and other in 2020 

textron systems backlog 

backlog at textron systems’ decreased 412 million in 2021 primarily due to revenues recognized in excess of new contracts received 

industrial 



industrial revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2021 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 



industrial segment revenues increased 130 million 4 in 2021 compared with 2020 due to a favorable impact of 142 million from pricing principally in the specialized vehicles product line and 50 million from foreign exchange rate fluctuations largely related to the euro and the chinese yuan in the fuel systems and functional components product line these increases were partially offset by lower volume and mix of 62 million largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line due to the impact of global supply chain shortages on our original equipment manufacturer customers 

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 101 million 3 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily reflecting inflation of 105 million largely in material costs and an unfavorable impact of 54 million from foreign exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix described above 

industrial segment profit 

factors contributing to 2021 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 



segment profit for the industrial segment increased 29 million 26 in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to a favorable impact of 37 million from pricing net of inflation largely in the specialized vehicles product line and a favorable impact of 10 million from performance partially offset by lower volume and mix as described above 

finance 



finance segment revenues decreased 6 million in 2021 compared with 2020 and segment profit increased 9 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower provision for loan losses the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables 



since the first quarter of 2020 the finance segment has worked with certain customers impacted by the pandemic to provide payment relief through loan modifications the majority of loans modified have returned to paying principal and interest we believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts loan modifications and key portfolio quality indicators are discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible products and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

assessment of liquidity and significant future cash requirements 

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 



we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of our capacity to add further leverage 

we expect to have sufficient cash to meet our needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and the availability of our existing credit facility in addition to our manufacturing operating cash requirements future material cash outlays include our contractual combined debt and interest payments for the manufacturing group of 117 million in 2022 119 million in 2023 461 million in 2024 and 32 billion thereafter and for the finance group of 274 million in 2022 20 million in 2023 16 million in 2024 and 390 million thereafter 

for the manufacturing group we also have purchase obligations that require material future cash outlays totaling 25 billion in 2022 392 million in 2023 and 86 million thereafter purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates as well as property plant and equipment approximately 29 of our purchase obligations represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years without the option to deduct these expenses in the year incurred we estimate that our tax payments will increase by approximately 300 million in 2022 depending on the final amount of research and development expenses incurred during the year under the assumption that this legislation is not modified or repealed the impact will continue over the fiveyear amortization period but will decrease each year 

credit facilities and other sources of capital 

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit we may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to 13 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment the facility expires in october 2024 subject to up to two oneyear extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility at both january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 

we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities 

in august 2021 we repaid 50 million of the finance group’s 150 million variablerate loan due september 2021 on september 20 2021 the loan was amended to extend the maturity date to september 2022 for the remaining 100 million principal amount the annual interest rate was unchanged at libor plus 155 which is an annual interest rate of 165 at january 1 2022 

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below 



cash flows from operating activities were 15 billion in 2021 compared with 833 million in 2020 the 636 million yearoveryear increase in net cash inflow was primarily due to higher earnings and working capital improvements the working capital improvements reflected the impact of lower payments to settle accounts payable in 2021 compared with 2020 which had a 613 million cash outflow and a 253 million yearoveryear increase in contract liabilities largely reflecting higher customer deposits at the textron aviation segment partially offset by yearoveryear changes in inventories and accounts receivable net tax payments were 72 million and 34 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively pension contributions were 52 million and 47 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

in 2021 and 2020 investing cash flows primarily included capital expenditures of 375 million and 317 million respectively cash flows used by financing activities in 2021 included 921 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 135 million shares of our common stock under a 2020 share repurchase plan and 524 million of payments on longterm debt in 2020 cash flows provided by financing activities included 11 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 377 million of proceeds from borrowings against corporateowned life insurance policies partially offset by 548 million of payments on longterm debt 377 million of payments on borrowings against corporateowned life insurance policies and 183 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 41 million shares of our common stock 

on january 25 2022 we announced the authorization of the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock this new plan allows us to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from stockbased compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes the 2022 plan has no expiration date and replaced the prior 2020 share repurchase authorization which was utilized in 2021 and 2020 for repurchases 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 18 million in both 2021 and 2020 

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below 



the finance group’s cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables totaling 250 million and 128 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively and finance receivable originations of 100 million and 195 million respectively cash flows used in financing activities included payments on longterm and nonrecourse debt of 97 million and 45 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 



consolidated cash flows from operating activities were 16 billion in 2021 compared with 769 million in 2020 the 830 million yearoveryear increase in net cash inflow was primarily due to higher earnings and working capital improvements the working capital improvements reflected the impact of lower payments to settle accounts payable in 2021 compared with 2020 which had a 613 million cash outflow a 253 million yearoveryear increase in contract liabilities largely reflecting higher customer deposits at the textron aviation segment and a yearoveryear cash inflow of 220 million from captive finance receivables partially offset by yearoveryear changes in inventories and accounts receivable net tax payments were 93 million and 42 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively pension contributions were 52 million and 47 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

in 2021 and 2020 investing cash flows included capital expenditures of 375 million and 317 million respectively cash flows used by financing activities in 2021 primarily included 921 million of share repurchases and 621 million of payments on outstanding debt in 2020 cash flows provided by financing activities included 11 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 377 million from borrowings against corporateowned life insurance policies partially offset by 593 million of payments on outstanding debt 377 million of payments on borrowings against corporateowned life insurance policies and 183 million of share repurchases 

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and preowned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below 



under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement as amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2021 and 2020 to maintain compliance with the support agreement 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data which includes other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

a substantial portion of our revenues is related to longterm contracts with the us government including those under the us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program for the design development manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related parts and services we generally use the costtocost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under this measure the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred 

due to the number of years it may take to complete these contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on the contracts the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and accordingly is subject to change in estimating total costs at completion we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed engineering requirements product performance subcontractor performance availability and cost of materials labor productivity availability and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and costs of satisfying offset obligations among other variables our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change when our estimate of the total costs to be incurred on a contract exceeds the estimated total transaction price a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

at the outset of each contract we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements eg a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule eg the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspects of the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate 

changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate we utilize the cumulative catchup method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract under this method the inceptiontodate impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified the impact of our cumulative catchup adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below 



due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a reporting unit we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates and operating margins that are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts which include our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions the longterm revenue growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve the discount rates utilized in this analysis are based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

based on our annual impairment review the fair value calculated using the estimates discussed above exceeded the carrying value by an adequate amount for each reporting group accordingly we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

retirement benefits 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and international pension plans for certain of our employees beginning on january 1 2010 we initiated actions to commence the closure of the pension plans to new entrants we provide employees hired subsequent to these closures with defined contribution benefits our pension benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses or benefits include the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and discount rates we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2021 and 2020 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 710 and 755 respectively for 2021 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 725 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2021 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 262 compared with 336 in 2020 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 270 in 2021 compared with 345 in 2020 a decrease of 50 basispoints in this weightedaverage discount rate in 2021 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 20 million 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was 272 million and 318 million at january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively we also may hedge exposures to certain of our foreign currency assets and earnings by funding those asset positions with debt in the same foreign currency so the exposures are naturally offset 

interest rate risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we generally limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements we had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 289 million at january 1 2022 and 294 million at january 2 2021 which effectively converted certain floatingrate debt to a fixedrate equivalent 

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding finance lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business is being adversely impacted and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

our businesses have experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption and reduced demand for certain of our products due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the covid19 pandemic the effects of covid19 have included and could continue to include disruption of the operation or temporary closure of certain of our facilities or the facilities of our 

table of contents 

customers suppliers or business partners as well as other disruptions in our supply chains challenges resulting from the pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact the ability of many of our employees to work effectively due to illness quarantines facility closures changes in manufacturing processes to accommodate social distancing guidelines remote working arrangements or other governmentimposed operating restrictions we have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs as a result of these business and production disruptions likewise we have incurred and may continue to incur additional expenses related to implementing processes and procedures to comply with required operating restrictions and to enhance the safety of our facilities to protect the health of our employees 

our commercial businesses have been and may continue to be adversely impacted due to a general slowdown in demand for our general aviation products and services recreational and other specialized vehicles and automotive products we have experienced a decline in orders for our aviation products and services as well as lower deliveries of commercial helicopters and fixedwing aircraft because of reduced demand and travel restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic economic and other impacts from the pandemic may also result in future weak demand for our aviation and commercial helicopter products and services the delay or cancellation of existing orders by our customers and lower flight hours and consequently lower demand for parts and maintenance in addition new regulations by us or foreign governments and government agencies addressed to the aviation or travel industry could impose additional regulatory aircraft security travel restrictions or other requirements or restrictions related to the pandemic that could adversely impact demand for aircraft and rotorcraft or significantly reduce hours flown as a result our costs may further increase as a result of the covid19 outbreak these cost increases may not be fully recoverable negatively impacting our profitability and may continue even after the business environment has improved 

it is possible that the continued spread of covid19 and actions taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak could also further cause disruption in our supply chain or in the operations of our business partners impacting their ability to perform their obligations which could impact our ability to perform our contractual obligations cause delay by or limit the ability of the us government and other customers to perform including in making timely payments to us and cause other unpredictable events limitations on government operations could impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries in addition there may be changes in our us and foreign government customers’ priorities as they confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources these changes may impact current and future programs government payments and other practices procurements and funding decisions 

the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries the resulting economic downturn the severity and length of which cannot be predicted may cause continued reduced demand for our products delays or cancellations of customer orders the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products bankruptcies of our suppliers customers or other business partners adverse impact to investment performance of our pension plans and continued volatility in the global capital markets adversely impacting our access to capital the extent to which the pandemic could impact our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and also will depend on future developments most of which are outside our control such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the severity of the disease the development of treatments or vaccines and the effects of actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak 

see also risks related to our finance segment under financial risks section below 

aerospace and defense industry risks 

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast unexpected events such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted demand for our aircraft products and may continue to do so therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions has in the past caused and in the future may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled deferred or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2020 we derived approximately 30 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis 

table of contents 

even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the us government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than fullyear appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and in the future may result in a loss of anticipated revenues a loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending as well as the potential impact of sequestration could affect the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

us government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity can significantly increase our costs reducing our profitability our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the us government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract withhold cash on contract payments and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture or reduction of profits suspension or 

table of contents 

reduction of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

the use of multiaward contracts by the us government increases competition pricing pressure and cost 

the us government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types including indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity and multiaward contracts which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids in addition multiaward contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract further the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors 

our profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs  

under fixedprice contracts generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations additionally fixedprice contracts generally require progress payments rather than performancebased payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows under fixedprice incentive contracts we share with the us government cost underrun savings which are derived from total cost being less than target costs we also share in cost overruns which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs due to the nature of our work under government contracts we sometimes experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

strategic risks 

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our us government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment the market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that in some cases have resulted and in the future could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses 

business and operational risks 

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations we also outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing  malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources 

we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risknetwork protection mitigation plans and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure additionally we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks further our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident 

while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated and we may not always be successful in detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents future attacks or breaches of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information exposing us to liability or regulatory action such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources increase costs that may not be covered by insurance and result in reputational damage potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers in addition our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft

industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business 

during 2020 we derived approximately 32 of our revenues from international business including us exports conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries risks related to international operations include import export economic sanctions and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against us goods impacts related to the voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges compliance with increasingly rigorous data privacy and protection laws competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

natural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

natural disasters including hurricanes fires tornados floods and other forms of severe weather the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change other impacts of climate change such as rising sea waters as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics power outages and industrial accidents have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business any of these events could result in physical damage to andor complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities temporary or longterm disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events the occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial risks 

if our finance segment has difficulty collecting on its finance receivables our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions such as the recent deterioration of the economy due to the impact from the covid19 pandemic the pandemic has resulted in disruptions in the ability of many of our customers to conduct business effectively because of illness quarantines government shutdown orders facility closures reduced customer demand or other restrictions as a result our finance segment has modified a significant number of the loans in its portfolio in order to provide temporary payment relief to its customers in addition the finance segment has provided extended payment relief to certain customers these modifications will delay our ultimate recovery on these assets in addition a substantial number of the originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in the event of borrower default which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables should current economic conditions persist or worsen our

finance segment may have difficulty successfully collecting on its finance receivable portfolio and as a result our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods software and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines we also may voluntarily take such action and from time to time have done so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future 

increased regulation related to global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions if environmental or climate change laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our business or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

table of contents 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims are from time to time asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties can be costly infringement claims also have resulted in legal restrictions on our businesses engaging in sales of allegedly infringing products if such a restriction were imposed upon a material product line our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats 

risks related to human capital 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 

our success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed we need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including among others engineering manufacturing information technology cybersecurity flight operations business development and strategy and management from time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures in addition some of our most experienced employees are retirementeligible to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise it is critical for us to develop other employees hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge competition for skilled employees is intense and we may incur higher labor recruiting andor training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills we may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 6800 or 28 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result from time to time we experience work stoppages which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers loss or delay of revenues andor increased cost the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

during 2020 the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus known as “covid19” led to worldwide facility closures workforce disruptions supply chain destabilizations reduced demand for many products and services volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook our operations experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the pandemic while some of our commercial manufacturing facilities had temporarily closed during the first quarter of 2020 through the latter part of the second quarter due to reduced demand for certain of our products substantially all manufacturing activities had resumed in the third quarter in the second half of the year our commercial businesses have generally experienced an increase in customer demand compared with the first half of 2020 however demand has not returned to prepandemic levels 

in the first quarter of 2020 following the onset of the pandemic we strengthened our cash position by issuing 650 million in senior debt and by borrowing 500 million under a new 364day term loan credit agreement we also temporarily suspended share repurchases and took other measures to reduce costs and conserve cash including employee furloughs at many of our commercial businesses and at corporate headquarters reducing capital expenditures and delaying certain research and development projects in the second quarter we continued most of the measures taken in the first quarter to reduce costs and conserve cash and initiated a restructuring plan at certain of our businesses to further reduce costs during the remainder of the year we continued our focus on managing our businesses through the impacts of the pandemic while investing in future products and technologies key financial highlights for 2020 include 

• generated 833 million of net cash from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses 

• maintained a strong cash position with 23 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year 

• invested 317 million in capital expenditures and 549 million in research and development projects 

• repurchased 41 million shares of our common stock 

while we expect our commercial businesses which have been adversely impacted by the pandemic to slowly recover with the broader economic recovery we cannot reasonably estimate when customer demand for our products and services may return to prepandemic levels there are many uncertainties regarding the pandemic and we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business including how it is impacting our customers employees suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels see item 1a risk factors for additional risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic’s impact on our business the ultimate extent of the effects of the pandemic on the company and our consolidated financial position is uncertain and will depend on future developments including the length and severity of the pandemic and such effects could exist for an extended period of time even after the pandemic ends 

for an overview of our business segments including a discussion of our major products and services refer to item 1 business a discussion of our financial condition and operating results for 2020 compared with 2019 is provided below while a discussion of 2019 compared with 2018 can be found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 4 2020 the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

consolidated results of operations 



table of contents 

revenues 

revenues decreased 20 billion 15 in 2020 compared with 2019 the revenue decrease included the following factors 

• textron aviation revenues were lower by 12 billion largely due to lower citation jet and commercial turboprop volume of 916 million reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic and lower aftermarket volume of 337 million reflecting lower aircraft utilization resulting from the pandemic 

• industrial revenues were lower by 798 million largely due to lower volume in the fuel systems and functional components product line primarily due to manufacturing facility closures in the first half of 2020 and lower volume and mix in the specialized vehicles product line primarily reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic 

• bell revenues were higher by 55 million due to higher military revenues of 225 million largely reflecting spares and logistics support partially offset by lower commercial revenues 

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

cost of sales decreased 13 billion 12 in 2020 compared with 2019 largely due to lower net volume and mix described above the decrease in cost of sales was partially offset by idle facility costs of 142 million primarily at the textron aviation segment reflecting unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures and a 55 million inventory charge related to the tru business discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 290 basis points in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower margin at the textron aviation segment reflecting unfavorable impacts from the pandemic including the idle facility costs and inventory valuation charges 

selling and administrative expense decreased 107 million 9 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to cost reduction activities across our manufacturing segments principally at the textron aviation and industrial segments

income taxes 



in 2020 the effective tax rate of 96 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to an audit settlement with respect to certain state income tax returns that resulted in a 52 million benefit and the favorable impact of research credits in 2019 the effective tax rate of 135 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to 61 million in benefits recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis

industrial segment revenues decreased 798 million 21 in 2020 compared with 2019 largely due to lower volume and mix in both product lines lower volume in the fuel systems and functional components product line was primarily related to manufacturing facility closures in the first half of 2020 as a result of the pandemic as our oem customers reopened and resumed production all of our manufacturing facilities had reopened by the end of the second quarter in the specialized vehicles product line lower volume and mix was primarily related to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business which has been impacted by the reduction in global air travel as well as reduced demand in certain consumer and commercial markets that have been impacted by the pandemic 

operating expenses for the industrial segment decreased 692 million 19 in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower volume and mix described above 

industrial segment profit 

factors contributing to 2020 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 



segment profit for the industrial segment decreased 106 million in 2020 compared with 2019 largely resulting from lower volume and mix described above partially offset by favorable performance of 61 million performance includes the impact from cost reduction activities partially offset by idle facility costs of 27 million recognized in 2020 reflecting unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures

finance 



finance segment revenues decreased 11 million in 2020 compared with 2019 and segment profit decreased 18 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher provision for loan losses the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables 



the finance segment has provided temporary payment relief through loan modifications at the request of certain customers and continues to work with certain customers to provide extended payment relief as needed if the current economic conditions continue to persist or worsen we may experience increased customer delinquencies however we believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts loan modifications and key portfolio quality indicators are discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 



the unprecedented conditions surrounding the covid19 pandemic led to volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook in addition to causing various degrees of disruption in our operations in light of these conditions we have strengthened our cash position since the onset of the pandemic by taking various measures to reduce costs and conserve cash and by increasing our borrowings as discussed below given our strengthened liquidity position and stabilization of the capital markets in the second half of 2020 we reactivated our share repurchase plan in the fourth quarter we believe that we will have

credit facilities and other sources of capital 

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit we may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to 13 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment the facility expires in october 2024 subject to up to two oneyear extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility at january 2 2021 and january 4 2020 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 9 million and 10 million respectively of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 

we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities in march 2020 we issued 650 million in secregistered fixedrate notes due june 2030 with an annual interest rate of 300 in august 2020 we issued 500 million of secregistered fixedrate notes due march 2031 with an annual interest rate of 245 the proceeds of which were used to repay 500 million of outstanding borrowings under a new 364day term loan credit agreement entered into in april 2020 

in september 2020 the finance group’s 150 million variablerate loan due december 2020 was amended to extend its maturity date to september 2021 with an option to extend for an additional year the annual interest rate was modified from the london interbank offered rate libor plus 1125 to libor plus 155 which is an annual interest rate of 170 at january 2 2021

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and preowned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows

contractual obligations 

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 2 2021 



pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2021 we expect to make approximately 22 million of contributions to our funded pension plans based on our current assumptions which may vary with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2022 through 2025 is estimated to be approximately 51 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and reserves for product liability warranty product maintenance and litigation have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 42 of the purchase obligations we

disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of january 2 2021 



critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data which includes other significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

a substantial portion of our revenues is related to longterm contracts with the us government including those under the us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program for the design development manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related parts and services we generally use the costtocost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under this measure the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred 

approximately 75 of our 2020 revenues with the us government were under fixedprice and fixedprice incentive contracts to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss 

the transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable certain of our longterm contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical performance and all other information that is reasonably available to us 

due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and accordingly is subject to change in estimating total costs at completion we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed engineering requirements product performance subcontractor performance availability and cost of materials labor productivity availability and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and costs of satisfying offset obligations among other variables our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

at the outset of each contract we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements eg a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule eg the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may 

table of contents 

increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspects of the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate 

changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate we utilize the cumulative catchup method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract under this method the inceptiontodate impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified the impact of our cumulative catchup adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below 



due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate a potential impairment of a reporting unit a reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm revenue growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve the discount rates utilized in this analysis are based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

retirement benefits 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and international pension and postretirement plans for certain of our employees beginning on january 1 2010 we initiated actions to commence the closure of the pension plans to new entrants we provide employees hired subsequent to these closures with defined contribution benefits our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses or benefits include the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

table of contents 

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2020 and 2019 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 755 for 2020 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 775 for 2021 to reflect the impact of current expectations of longterm market conditions on certain investment returns we have assumed a longterm rate of return for our domestic plans of 725 the change in this assumption will increase pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 35 million 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2020 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 336 compared with 424 in 2019 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 345 in 2020 compared with 435 in 2019 a decrease of 50 basispoints in this weightedaverage discount rate in 2020 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 64 million 

actuarial gains and losses representing differences between the assumptions utilized to develop estimated obligations and actual results or experience that exceed 10 of the higher of the market related value of assets or the benefit obligation in a year are initially recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and amortized over future years as a component of our annual benefit cost we amortize actuarial differences over the average remaining service period of eligible employees if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive or are not accruing additional benefits we amortize these differences over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants as of the end of 2020 almost all of the participants in one of our domestic plans the textron master retirement plan tmrp are no longer active beginning in 2021 actuarial gains and losses for this plan will be amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants a change in the tmrp amortization period in 2021 from 7 years to 20 years will reduce pension cost by approximately 85 million the deferral of these differences reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from yeartoyear changes in the assumptions or from actual results that are not necessarily representative of the longterm financial position of these plans 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2020 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2020 we assumed a trend rate of 7 for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5 by 2024 and then remain at that level 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was 318 million and 342 million at january 2 2021 and january 4 2020 respectively we also may hedge exposures to certain of our foreign currency assets and earnings by funding those asset positions with debt in the same foreign currency so the exposures are naturally offset 

interest rate risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we generally limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements at the end of 2020 we had an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of 294 million which effectively converted certain floatingrate debt to a fixedrate equivalent 

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding finance lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

table of contents 

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future

 ​ 

 




 item 1a risk factors

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

during 2019 we derived approximately 24 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the us government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than fullyear appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and in the future may result in a loss of anticipated revenues a loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending as well as the potential impact of sequestration could affect the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity

us government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

​ 

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations  our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity can significantly increase our costs reducing our profitability our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the us government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract withhold cash on contract payments and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture or reduction of profits suspension or reduction of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business

the use of multiaward contracts by the us government increases competition pricing pressure and cost

the us government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types including indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity and multiaward contracts which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids in addition multiaward contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract further the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors

our profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs  

under fixedprice contracts generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations additionally fixedprice contracts generally require progress payments rather than performancebased payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows under fixedprice incentive contracts we share with the us government cost underrun savings which are derived from total cost being less than target costs we also share in cost overruns which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs due to the nature of our work under government contracts we sometimes experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards

​ 

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions has in the past caused and in the future may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled deferred or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business

we enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that in some cases have resulted and in the future could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations we also outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing  malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources

we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risknetwork protection mitigation plans and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure additionally we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks further our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident

​ 

while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated and we may not always be successful in detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents future attacks or breaches of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information exposing us to liability or regulatory action such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources increase costs that may not be covered by insurance and result in reputational damage potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers in addition our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our us government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment the market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business

during 2019 we derived approximately 34 of our revenues from international business including us exports conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries risks related to international operations include import export economic sanctions and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against us goods impacts related to the voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union “brexit” restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results

​ 

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods software and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a substantial number of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

we periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected

natural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

natural disasters including hurricanes fires tornados floods and other forms of severe weather the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change other impacts of climate change such as rising sea waters as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics power outages industrial explosions or other accidents have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business any of these events could result in physical damage to andor complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities temporary or longterm disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events the occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions if environmental or climate change laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our business or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers

intellectual property infringement claims are from time to time asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties can be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines we also may voluntarily take such action and from time to time have done so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future

our success is highly dependent on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 

our success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed we need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including among others engineering manufacturing information technology cybersecurity flight operations business development and strategy and management from time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures in addition some of our most experienced employees are retirementeligible to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise it is critical for us to develop other employees hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge competition for skilled employees is intense and we may incur higher labor recruiting andor training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills we may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations

​ 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results

our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues

approximately 7400 or 29 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result from time to time we experience work stoppages which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers loss or delay of revenue andor increased cost the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates fluctuations in foreign currency rates contribute to variations in revenues and costs in impacted jurisdictions which can adversely affect our profitability we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

at the beginning of 2018 we adopted accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using a modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of 2017 we recorded a 90 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of 2018 primarily related to certain longterm contracts our bell segment has with the us government that converted to the costtocost method for revenue recognition for 2019 and 2018 revenues for our us government contracts were primarily recognized as costs are incurred while revenues for 2017 were primarily recognized as units were delivered the comparative information for 2017 has not been restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect at that time

2019 financial highlights 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 ​ 

revenues 

revenues decreased 342 million 2 in 2019 compared with 2018 the revenue decrease included the following factors

 

revenues decreased 226 million 2 in 2018 compared with 2017 largely driven by the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line within the industrial segment the net revenue decrease included the following factors

 ​ 

 

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

cost of sales decreased 188 million 2 in 2019 compared with 2018 largely resulting from the impact from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line improved performance and a favorable impact of 48 million from foreign exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 94 million from inflation gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 70 basis points in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower margin at the textron aviation segment reflecting the mix of aircraft sold in the year

selling and administrative expense decreased 123 million 10 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily reflecting the impact from the disposition of tools and test equipment product line and cost reduction activities in the specialized vehicles product line 

in 2018 cost of sales decreased 233 million 2 compared with 2017 largely resulting from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line and lower net volume as described above selling and administrative expense decreased 59 million 4 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflecting the impact from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line

interest expense

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest consolidated interest expense increased 5 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2018 consolidated interest expense decreased 8 million compared with 2017 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding

gain on business disposition

on july 2 2018 we completed the sale of the businesses that manufacture and sell the products in the tools and test equipment product line within our industrial segment we recorded an aftertax gain of 419 million in 2018

income taxes

 ​ 

in 2019 the effective tax rate of 135 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to 61 million in benefits recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis 

in 2018 our effective tax rate of 117 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line which resulted in a gain taxable primarily in nonus jurisdictions that partially exempt such gains from tax the effective tax rate for 2018 also reflects a 25 million benefit recognized upon the reassessment of our reserve for uncertain tax positions based on new information including interactions with the tax authorities and recent audit settlements in addition we finalized the 2017 impacts of the tax cut and jobs act the tax act and recognized a 14 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018

our effective tax rate of 598 for 2017 was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to the impact from the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a provisional estimate of 266 million for onetime adjustments resulting from the tax act approximately 154 million of this provisional estimate represented a charge resulting from the remeasurement of our us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities and the remainder represented a provision for the transition tax on post1986 earnings and profits previously deferred from us income taxes

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

 ​ 

textron systems’ segment profit increased 17 million 12 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to favorable performance and other of 62 million partially offset by lower volume described above performance and other improved largely due to unfavorable program adjustments of 44 million recorded in 2017 related to the tapv program in 2017 this program experienced inefficiencies resulting from various production issues during the ramp up and subsequent production

textron systems backlog

in 2019 backlog decreased 258 million 18 primarily in the marine and land systems product line as revenues recognized exceeded new contracts

industrial revenues and operating expenses

factors contributing to the 2019 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below

 ​ 

industrial segment revenues decreased 493 million 11 in 2019 compared with 2018 largely due to the impact of 248 million from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line in 2018 and 233 million of lower volume and mix at the remaining product lines primarily in the specialized vehicles product line the reduction in volume in the specialized vehicles product line largely reflected our management of the distribution channel related to products under the arctic cat brand including a reduction of inventories sold into the channel 

operating expenses for the industrial segment decreased 492 million 12 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower operating expenses of 226 million from the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line lower volume and mix described above and improved performance described below

factors contributing to the 2018 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below

 ​ 

industrial segment revenues increased 5 million in 2018 compared with 2017 higher volume of 149 million largely related to the specialized vehicles product line a favorable impact of 57 million from foreign exchange primarily related to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and the impact of 49 million from the acquisition of arctic cat on march 6 2017 were largely offset by 246 million in lower revenues due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line 

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 77 million 2 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher volume described above the impact from foreign exchange and additional operating expenses from the arctic cat acquisition these increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses from the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line

​ 

industrial segment profit

factors contributing to 2019 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below

 ​ 

segment profit for the industrial segment was largely unchanged in 2019 compared with 2018 as favorable performance of 94 million principally in the specialized vehicles product line primarily reflecting cost reduction activities was largely offset by the impact from lower volume and mix described above performance also includes the impact of a 17 million favorable adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a patent infringement matter

factors contributing to 2018 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below

 ​ 

segment profit for the industrial segment decreased 72 million 25 in 2018 compared with 2017 resulting from the impact of the disposition of our tools and test equipment product line of 22 million an unfavorable impact of pricing and inflation of 21 million and unfavorable performance and other of 16 million which were both primarily related to the specialized vehicles product line the unfavorable volume and mix was primarily due to the mix of products sold in the year performance and other primarily included additional operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 due to the timing of the arctic cat acquisition and the seasonality of the outdoor power sports business and unfavorable inventory adjustments in the specialized vehicles product line partially offset by a favorable impact of 17 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a patent infringement matter

finance

 ​ 

finance segment revenues were unchanged and segment profit increased 5 million in 2019 compared with 2018 finance segment revenues decreased 3 million and segment profit increased 1 million in 2018 compared with 2017 the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables

 ​ 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below

 ​ 

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate

on october 18 2019 textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit textron may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to 13 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment the facility expires in october 2024 subject to up to two oneyear extensions at textron’s option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility this new facility replaced the prior 5year facility which was scheduled to expire in september 2021 at january 4 2020 and december 29 2018 there were no amounts borrowed against either facility at january 4 2020 there were 10 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the new facility and at december 29 2018 there were 10 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the prior facility 

we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities under this registration statement in may 2019 we issued 300 million of fixedrate notes due september 2029 with an annual interest rate of 390

in june 2019 we amended the finance group’s 150 million fixedrate loan due august 2019 extending the maturity date to june 2022 and modifying the annual interest rate from the prior rate of 226 to 288

manufacturing group cash flows

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below

 ​ 

in 2019 cash flows from operating activities were 960 million compared with 1127 million in 2018 a decrease of 167 million the change in cash flows included a 364 million decrease from changes in inventories between the periods and a 133 million decrease from other liabilities primarily due to changes in salaries wages and employer taxes payable partially offset by a 343 million increase in cash flows from changes in accounts payable 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2018 were 1127 million compared with 930 million in 2017 a 21 increase primarily reflecting lower pension contributions of 306 million higher earnings and a dividend of 50 million received from the finance group in 2018 which were partially offset by a higher use of net working capital in 2018 largely reflecting a 145 million cash outflow from changes in net taxes paidreceived

net tax paymentsreceipts were 120 million 129 million and 16 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively pension contributions were 51 million 52 million and 358 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2017 pension contributions included a 300 million discretionary contribution to fund a us pension plan

on february 25 2020 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock this new plan allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares and to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under compensation and benefit plans the 2020 plan replaces the prior 2018 share repurchase authorization which was utilized in 2019 and 2018 for repurchases funded in part by the net proceeds of 08 billion from the disposition of the tools and test product line 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 18 million 20 million and 21 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively dividends received from the finance group which totaled 50 million in both 2019 and 2018 are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment

​ 

captive financing and other intercompany transactions

the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and preowned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows

reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below

 ​ 

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement as amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2019 2018 and 2017 to maintain compliance with the support agreement

contractual obligations 

manufacturing group

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 4 2020

 ​ 

pension and postretirement benefits

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2020 we expect to make approximately 25 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may vary with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2021 through 2024 is estimated to be approximately 50 million under the plan provisions in place at this time

​ 

other longterm liabilities

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and reserves for product liability warranty product maintenance and litigation have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments

purchase obligations

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 39 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses

finance group

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of january 4 2020

 ​ 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies

revenue recognition

a substantial portion of our revenues is related to longterm contracts with the us government including those under us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program for the design development manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related services 

at the beginning of 2018 we adopted asc 606 as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements with the adoption of this standard  due to the continuous transfer of control to the us government we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract selecting the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided we generally use the costtocost method to measure progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under this measure the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred

prior to the asc 606 adoption we accounted for our longterm contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method we estimated profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract we then recognized that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the unitsofdelivery method or the costtocost method which typically was used for development effort as costs were incurred as appropriate under the circumstances revenues under fixed price contracts generally were recorded using the unitsofdelivery method while revenues under costreimbursement contracts were recorded using the costtocost method

approximately 70 of our 2019 revenues with the us government were under fixedprice and fixedprice incentive contracts to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss

​ 

the transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we expect to receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable certain of our longterm contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical performance and all other information that is reasonably available to us

due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and accordingly is subject to change in estimating total costs at completion we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed engineering requirements product performance subcontractor performance availability and cost of materials labor productivity availability and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and costs of satisfying offset obligations among other variables our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined

at the outset of each contract we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements eg a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule eg the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspects of the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate

changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate we utilize the cumulative catchup method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract under this method the inceptiontodate impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified the impact of our cumulative catchup adjustments on revenues and segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below

 ​ 

with the adoption of asc 606 in 2018 a significant portion of our contracts with the us government converted to the costtocost method for revenue recognition from the units of delivery method the costtocost method generally results in larger cumulative catchup adjustments since revenue is recognized earlier on these contracts requiring the estimation of costs over longer periods of time under the units of delivery method that we used for many of our contracts in 2017 we had more time to develop and refine our estimates as we were not required to recognize revenue until our products were delivered much later in the contract term

due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones

​ 

goodwill

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future

retirement benefits

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2019 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 755 compared with 758 in 2018 for the last seven years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 775 a decrease of 50 basispoints in this longterm rate of return in 2019 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 36 million

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2019 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 424 compared with 367 in 2018 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 435 in 2019 compared with 375 in 2018 a decrease of 50 basispoints in this weightedaverage discount rate in 2019 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 34 million

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2019 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2019 we assumed a trend rate of 7 for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5 by 2024 and then remain at that level

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign currency exchange risk

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was 342 million and 379 million at january 4 2020 and december 29 2018 respectively we also manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated statements of operations are as follows

 ​ 

interest rate risk

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we generally limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities

quantitative risk measures

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding finance lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2018 we derived approximately 24 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the us government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than fullyear appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending as well as the impact of sequestration could affect the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis for example if the us government is shut down for an extended period of time or the debt ceiling is not raised our customer may not pay us on a timely basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future 

  

  

contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the us government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract withhold cash on contract payments and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

the use of multiaward contracts by the us government may increase competition and pricing pressure 

the us government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types including indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity and multiaward contracts which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract further the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors 

  

our profitability and cash flow may vary depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs  

under fixedprice contracts generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations additionally fixedprice contracts may require progress payments rather than performancebased payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows fixedprice incentivebased fee arrangements provide that allowable costs incurred are reimbursable but are subject to a costshare which could negatively impact our profitability under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control 

  

  

costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly t here is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses 

  

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected  

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a substantial number of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations we also outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing  malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources 

  

we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risknetwork protection mitigation plans and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure additionally we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks further our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident 

  

while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated and we may not be successful in detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner future attacks or breaches of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information exposing us to liability or regulatory action such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources increase costs that may not be covered by insurance and result in reputational damage potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers in addition our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could adversely affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our us government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

during 2018 we derived approximately 38 of our revenues from international business including us exports conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries risks related to international operations include import export and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements impacts related to the pending voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union “brexit” restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7200 or 28 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates fluctuations in foreign currency rates may contribute to variations in revenue and costs in impacted jurisdictions which could adversely affect our profitability we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate 

  

  

future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly changed us income tax law any additional tax legislation in the united states or elsewhere could adversely affect our effective tax rate have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets or increase our future us tax expense

 item 7 manage m ent’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview and consolidated results of operations 

  

for an overview of our business segments including a discussion of our major products and services refer to item 1 business on pages 3 through 9   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below and a more detailed analysis of our segments’ operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 through 27

  

at the beginning of 2018 we adopted accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of 2017 we recorded a 90 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of 2018 primarily related to certain longterm contracts our bell segment has with the us government that converted to the costtocost method for revenue recognition revenues in 2018 for our us government contracts are primarily recognized as costs are incurred while revenues for 2017 were primarily recognized as units were delivered the comparative information has not been restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods a reconciliation of the financial statement line items impacted for 2018 under asc 606 to the prior accounting standards is provided in note 12

·   segment profit increased by 8 to 13 billion 

·   generated 11 billion of net cash from operating activities of continuing operations for our manufacturing businesses  

·   completed the sale of the tools and test equipment product line within our industrial segment and received 08 billion in net cash proceeds

revenues 

  

   

revenues decreased 226 million 2 in 2018 compared with 2017 largely driven by the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line within the industrial segment  the net revenue decrease included the following factors 

  

·   lower textron systems revenues of 376 million primarily reflecting lower volume of 159 million in the marine and land systems product line along with a decrease due to the discontinuance of our sensorfuzed weapon product in 2017

·   lower bell revenues of 137 million primarily due to lower commercial revenues of 91 million largely reflecting the mix of aircraft sold in the year and lower military revenues of 46 million

·   higher textron aviation revenues of 285 million due to higher volume and mix of 185 million and favorable pricing of 100 million 

·   higher industrial revenues of 5 million primarily due to higher volume of 149 million largely related to the textron specialized vehicles product line a favorable impact of 57 million from foreign exchange and the impact from the arctic cat acquisition of 49 million these increases were largely offset by 246 million in lower revenues due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line

  

  

revenues increased 410 million 3 in 2017 compared with 2016 largely driven by increases in the industrial textron systems and bell segments partially offset by lower revenues at the textron aviation segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher industrial revenues of 492 million primarily due to the impact from the acquisition of arctic cat 

·   higher textron systems revenues of 84 million primarily due to higher volume of 176 million in the marine and land systems product line partially offset by lower volume in the other products lines

·   higher bell revenues of 78 million primarily due to an increase in commercial revenues of 89 million largely reflecting higher commercial aircraft deliveries 

·   lower textron aviation revenues of 235 million primarily due to lower volume and mix of 307 million largely the result of lower military and commercial turboprop volume 

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

in 2018 cost of sales decreased 233 million 2 compared with 2017 largely resulting from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line and lower net volume as described above  selling and administrative expense decreased 59 million 4 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflecting the impact from the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line  

  

cost of sales increased 490 million 4 and selling and administrative expense increased 17 million 1 in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase from acquired businesses largely arctic cat gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 100 basis points from 2016 primarily due to lower margins at the textron systems segment largely reflecting an unfavorable impact from net program adjustments and the industrial segment which included the impact from the arctic cat acquisition 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest consolidated interest expense decreased 8 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding 

  

gain on business disposition 

on july 2 2018 we completed the sale of the businesses that manufacture and sell the products in our tools and test equipment product line within our industrial segment we received net cash proceeds of 807 million in connection with this disposition and recorded an aftertax gain of 419 million 

  

special charges 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded 73 million in special charges in connection with a plan to restructure the textron specialized vehicles businesses within our industrial segment these businesses have undergone significant changes since the acquisition of arctic cat as we have expanded the product portfolio and integrated manufacturing operations and retail distribution in the third quarter of 2018 the operating results for these businesses were significantly below our expectations as dealer sellthrough lagged despite the introduction of new products into our dealer network based on our review and assessment of the acquired dealer network and gotomarket strategy for the textron off road and arctic cat brands in the fourth quarter of 2018 along with a review of the other businesses within the product line we initiated a restructuring plan this plan included product rationalization closure of several factorydirect turfcare branch locations and a manufacturing facility and headcount reductions under this plan we recorded asset impairment charges of 47 million primarily intangible assets related to product rationalization contract termination and other costs of 18 million and severance costs of 8 million headcount reductions totaled approximately 400 positions 

  

  

representing 10 of textron specialized vehicles’ workforce the actions taken under this plan were substantially completed at the end of 2018 

  

in 2017 and 2016 we recorded special charges of 90 million and 123 million respectively related to a plan that was initiated in 2016 to restructure and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall operating efficiency across textron the 2016 plan was completed in 2017 special charges related to this plan included 97 million of severance costs 84 million of asset impairments and 32 million in contract terminations and other costs of these amounts 83 million was incurred at textron systems 63 million at textron aviation 38 million at industrial 28 million at bell and 1 million at corporate the total headcount reduction under this plan was approximately 2100 positions representing 5 of our workforce 

  

in connection with the acquisition of arctic cat we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2017 and recorded restructuring charges of 28 million in 2017 which included 19 million of severance costs largely related to changeofcontrol provisions and 9 million of contract termination and other costs in addition we recorded 12 million of acquisitionrelated integration and transaction costs in 2017 

  

for 2017 and 2016 special charges recorded by segment and type of cost are as follows 

  

   

income taxes 

  

   

in 2018 our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the disposition of the tools and test equipment product line which resulted in a gain taxable primarily in nonus jurisdictions that partially exempt such gains from tax the effective tax rate for 2018 also reflects a 25 million benefit recognized upon the reassessment of our reserve for uncertain tax positions based on new information including interactions with the tax authorities and recent audit settlements in addition we finalized the 2017 impacts of the tax cut and jobs act the “tax act” and recognized a 14 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018 

  

our effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to the impact from the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a provisional estimate of 266 million for onetime adjustments resulting from the tax act approximately 154 million of this provisional estimate represented a charge resulting from the remeasurement of our us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities and the remainder represented a provision for the transition tax on post1986 earnings and profits previously deferred from us income taxes 

  

in 2016 our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to a settlement with the us internal revenue service office of appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years this settlement resulted in a 206 million benefit recognized in continuing operations and a 113 million benefit in discontinued operations 

  

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate see note 16 

  

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments textron aviation bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses gainslosses on major business dispositions and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense operating expenses for the manufacturing segments include cost of sales selling and administrative expense and other nonservice components of net periodic benefit costcredit and exclude certain corporate expenses and special charges 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange acquisitions and dispositions while changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenues for our commercial business represent increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelvemonth period while reductions in revenues from the sale of businesses are reflected as dispositions for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension service cost or other costs performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead nonservice pension costcredit product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

approximately 24 of our 2018 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government including those under the us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program  for our segments that contract with the us government changes in revenue related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume revenues in 2018 for our us government contracts are primarily recognized as costs are incurred while revenues for 2017 and 2016 were primarily recognized as units were delivered changes in segment profit are typically expressed in terms of volume and performance these include cumulative catchup adjustments associated with a revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance

finance 

  

   

finance segment revenues decreased 3 million and segment profit increased 1 million in 2018 compared with 2017 finance segment revenues decreased 9 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily attributable to lower average finance receivables and segment profit increased 3 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to lower provision for loan losses partially offset by lower average finance receivables the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables 

  

   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

  

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate

  

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2021 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit at december 29 2018 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 10 million of letters of credit issued against it we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities

  

manufacturing group cash flows

in 2018 consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities was 1109 million compared with 963 million in 2017 a 15 increase primarily reflecting lower pension contributions of 306 million and higher earnings partially offset by a higher use of net working capital in 2018 reflecting a 114 million increase in net tax payments and 45 million in lower cash flows related to captive financing activities 

  

  

consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities was 963 million in 2017 compared with 927 million in 2016 a 4 increase as improvements in working capital  were largely offset by higher pension contributions of 308 million and lower earnings significant factors contributing to the favorable change in working capital included an increase in cash flows of 764 million related to changes in inventory between the periods principally in the textron aviation and textron systems segments 333 million related to changes in customer deposits and 142 million of lower net tax payments partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable the increase in cash flows from customer deposits between the periods is primarily related to lower performancebased payments received on certain military contracts in the bell segment in 2016

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and preowned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below 

   

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement as amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2018 2017 and 2016 to maintain compliance with the support agreement 

  

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 29 2018 

  

   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 14 included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2019 we expect to make approximately 25 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2020 through 2023 are estimated to be approximately 50 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 37 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of december 29 2018 

  

   

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition 

a substantial portion of our revenues is related to longterm contracts with the us government including those under us governmentsponsored foreign military sales program for t he design development manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related services at the beginning of 2018 we adopted accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method which permitted comparative information to not be restated this standard primarily impacted our contracts with the us government as we were required to convert certain contracts from the unitsofdelivery method to the costtocost method for revenue recognition under asc 606 while the timing of revenue recognition has changed for many of these contracts and the number of units of accounting known as performance obligations have been reduced from the prior standards the process for establishing and reviewing our revenue and cost estimates is consistent with the prior periods 

  

with the adoption of asc 606 in 2018 due to the continuous transfer of control to the us government we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract selecting the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided we generally use the costtocost method to measure progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts under this measure the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred 

  

prior to the asc 606 adoption we accounted for our longterm contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method we estimated profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract we then recognized that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the unitsofdelivery method or the costtocost method which typically was used for development effort as costs were incurred as appropriate under the circumstances revenues under fixed price contracts generally were recorded using the unitsofdelivery method while revenues under costreimbursement contracts were recorded using the costtocost method 

  

approximately 80 of our 2018 revenues with the us government were under fixedprice and fixedprice incentive contracts to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss 

  

the transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we expect to receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable certain of our longterm contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical performance and all other information that is reasonably available to us 

  

due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and accordingly is subject to change in estimating total costs at completion we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed engineering requirements product performance subcontractor performance availability and cost of materials labor productivity availability and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and costs of satisfying offset obligations among other variables our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 

  

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements eg a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule eg the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspects of the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate 

  

increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inceptiontodate effect of such changes changes in our profit booking rate due to changes in our estimate of the total expected costs along with changes in the transaction price are recognized on a cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period the impact of our gross cumulative catchup adjustments on revenues and segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below 

  

   

with the adoption of asc 606 at the beginning of 2018 a significant portion of our contracts with the us government converted to the costtocost method for revenue recognition from the units of delivery method the costtocost method generally results in larger cumulative catchup adjustments since revenue is recognized earlier on these contracts requiring the estimation of costs over longer periods of time under the units of delivery method that we used for many of our contracts in 2017 and 2016 we had more time to develop and refine our estimates as we were not required to recognize revenue until our products were delivered much later in the contract term 

  

due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2018 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 758 compared with 757 in 2017 for the last seven years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 93 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50 basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2018 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 33 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2018 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 367 compared with 413 in 2017 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 375 in 2018 compared with 425 in 2017 a 50 basispoint decrease in this weightedaverage discount rate in 2018 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 31 million 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2018 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2018 we assumed a trend rate of 7 for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5 by 2024 and then remain at that level 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was 379 million and 426 million at december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 respectively we also manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated statements of operations are as follows 

  

   

interest rate risk 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we generally limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities 

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding capital lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

  

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2017 we derived approximately 22 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the us government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than fullyear appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

under the budget control act of 2011 the us government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if for example the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result our customer does not pay us on a timely basis we may need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft 

  

  

and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones including for example regulations related to cybersecurity can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the us government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract withhold cash on contract payments and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials any of which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

the use of multiaward contracts by the us government may increase competition and pricing pressure 

the us government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types including indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity and multiaward contracts which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract further the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors 

  

our profitability and cash flow may vary depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs  

under fixedprice contracts generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations additionally fixedprice contracts may require progress payments rather than performance based payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows fixedprice incentivebased fee arrangements provide that allowable costs incurred are reimbursable but are subject to a costshare which could negatively impact our profitability under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

  

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly t here is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected  

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a substantial number of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations in addition 

  

  

we outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of these security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated future attacks or breach of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information exposing us to liability or regulatory action such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources increase costs which may not be covered by insurance and result in reputational damage potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our us government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

during 2017 we derived approximately 38 of our revenues from international business including us exports and we expect international revenues to continue to increase conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments risks related to international operations include import export and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives 

  

  

consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cybersecurity threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related 

  

  

expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7200 or 27 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly changed us income tax law we have made provisional estimates of the impact of the act on the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and the onetime transition tax in 2017 however the financial reporting effects of the act are complex and are subject to change as guidance interpreting the act is issued the effect of such guidance as well as any additional tax reform legislation in the united states or elsewhere could adversely affect our effective tax rate have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets or increase our future us tax expense

revenues 

  

   

revenues increased 410 million 3 in 2017 compared with 2016 largely driven by increases in the industrial textron systems and bell segments partially offset by lower revenues at the textron aviation segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher industrial revenues of 492 million primarily due to the impact from the acquisition of arctic cat described in the segment analysis section below 

·   higher textron systems revenues of 84 million primarily due to higher volume of 176 million in the marine and land systems product line partially offset by lower volume in the other products lines

·   higher bell revenues of 78 million primarily due to an increase in commercial revenues of 89 million largely reflecting higher commercial aircraft deliveries 

·   lower textron aviation revenues of 235 million primarily due to lower volume and mix of 307 million largely the result of lower military and commercial turboprop volume 

  

revenues increased 365 million 3 in 2016 compared with 2015 largely driven by increases in the industrial textron systems and textron aviation segments partially offset by lower revenues at the bell segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher industrial revenues of  250 million primarily due to higher volume of  168 million largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line and the impact from acquired businesses of  121 million 

·   higher textron systems revenues of 236 million primarily due to higher volume of 106 million in the marine and land systems product line and 77 million in the unmanned systems product line

·   higher textron aviation revenues of  99 million primarily due to the impact from an acquired business of 66 million and higher volume and mix of  42 million largely the result of higher citation jet volume of  165 million partially offset by lower commercial turboprop volume 

·   lower bell revenues of 215 million primarily due to a decrease in commercial revenues of 269 million largely reflecting lower commercial aircraft deliveries 

  

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

in 2017 cost of sales increased 484 million 4 and selling and administrative expense increased 33 million 3 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase from acquired businesses largely arctic cat gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 100 basis points from 2016 primarily due to lower margins at the textron systems segment largely reflecting an unfavorable impact from net program adjustments and the industrial segment which included the impact from the arctic cat acquisition 

  

cost of sales increased 332 million 3 in 2016 compared with 2015 largely due to higher volume at the textron systems industrial and textron aviation segments and an increase from acquired businesses these increases were partially offset by lower volume at the bell segment and favorable cost performance across all of our manufacturing segments

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest consolidated interest expense increased 5 million in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding 

  

special charges 

  

in 2016 we initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall operating efficiency across textron under this plan textron systems discontinued production of its sensorfuzed weapon product within its weapons and sensors operating unit we combined our jacobsen business with the textron specialized vehicles business by consolidating facilities and general and administrative functions and we reduced headcount at textron aviation as well as other businesses and corporate functions in december 2017 we decided to take additional restructuring actions to further consolidate operating facilities and streamline product lines primarily within the bell textron systems and industrial segments which resulted in additional special charges of 45 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded total special charges of 213 million since the inception of the 2016 plan which included 97 million of severance costs 84 million of asset impairments and 32 million in contract terminations and other costs of these amounts 83 million was incurred at textron systems 63 million at textron aviation 38 million at industrial 28 million at bell and 1 million at corporate the total headcount reduction under this plan is expected to be approximately 2100 positions representing 5 of our workforce

  

in connection with the acquisition of arctic cat as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2017 to integrate this business into our textron specialized vehicles business within the industrial segment and reduce operating redundancies and maximize efficiencies under the arctic cat plan we recorded restructuring charges of 28 million in 2017 which included 19 million of severance costs largely related to changeofcontrol provisions and 9 million of contract termination and other costs in addition we recorded 12 million of acquisitionrelated integration and transaction costs in 2017 

  

  

special charges recorded for these plans are as follows 

  

   

income taxes 

  

   

in 2017 our effective tax rate was significantly higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to the impact from the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a provisional estimate of 266 million for onetime adjustments resulting from the act approximately 154 million of this provisional estimate represents a charge resulting from the remeasurement of our us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities and the remainder represents a provision for the transition tax on post1986 earnings and profits previously deferred from us income taxes in addition the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 which is expected to lower our effective tax rate for 2018 and future years 

  

in 2016 our effective tax rate was significantly lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to a settlement with the us internal revenue service office of appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years this settlement resulted in a 206 million benefit recognized in continuing operations and a 113 million benefit in discontinued operations 

  

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments textron aviation bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenues represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelvemonth period for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

  

approximately 22 of our 2017 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are described in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

  

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate

  

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2021 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit at december 30 2017 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 11 million of letters of credit issued against it

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement as amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2017 2016 and 2015 to maintain compliance with the support agreement 

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 30 2017 

  

   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2018 we expect to make approximately 27 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2019 through 2022 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 50 million to 55 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

  

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements estimated environmental remediation costs and a onetime transition tax as disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements that will be paid over an eightyear period payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 33 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of december 30 2017 

  

 at december 30 2017 the finance group also had 38 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns 

  

  

or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended december 30 2017 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2017 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 757 compared with 758 in 2016 for the last six years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 91 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50 basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2017 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 30 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2017 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 413 compared with 466 in 2016 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 425 in 2017 compared with 475 in 2016 a 50 basispoint decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 37 million in 2017 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2017 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2017 we assumed a trend rate of 725 for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5 by 2024 and then remain at that level see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately 426 million and 665 million at december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively we also manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated financial statements are as follows 

  

   

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities 

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding capital lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

  

  

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2016 we derived approximately 25 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

under the budget control act of 2011 the us government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if for example the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result our customer does not pay us on a timely basis we may need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into 

  

  

“fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations additionally us government procurement policies increasingly favor fixedprice incentivebased fee arrangements rather than traditional fixedprice contracts these fee arrangements could negatively impact our profitability other current us government policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example the government has expressed a preference for requiring progress payments rather than performance based payments on new fixedprice contracts which if implemented delays our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly t here is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

  

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected  

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a majority of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and 

  

  

mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of these security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated an it system failure issues related to implementation of new it systems or breach of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs and could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

during 2016 we derived approximately 38 of our revenues from international business including us exports and we expect international revenues to continue to increase conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments risks related to international operations include import export and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the 

  

  

aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cybersecurity threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7300 or 28 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 manage m ent’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview and consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2016 revenues and segment profit grew by 3 and 4 respectively despite challenging and weaker than expected end markets most notably the business jet and commercial helicopter markets we continued to invest in our businesses through the ongoing development of new products and services and the completion of several strategic business acquisitions to support growth and create longterm shareholder value   financial highlights of 2016 include the following

  

·   generated 988 million in cash from operating activities of our manufacturing businesses 

·   invested 677 million in research and development activities 446 million in capital expenditures and 186 million in business acquisitions 

·   returned 263 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments 

·   initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses to improve overall operating efficiency and to better position our businesses for the future which resulted in special charges of 123 million 

  

an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below a more detailed analysis of our segments’ operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 to 28 

  

revenues 

  

   

revenues increased 365 million 3 in 2016 compared with 2015 largely driven by increases in the industrial textron systems and textron aviation segments partially offset by lower revenues at the bell segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher industrial revenues of 250 million primarily due to higher volume of 168 million largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line and the impact from acquired businesses of 121 million

·   higher textron systems revenues of 236 million primarily due to higher volume of 106 million in the marine and land systems product line and 77 million in the unmanned systems product line

·   higher textron aviation revenues of 99 million primarily due to the impact from an acquired business of 66 million and higher volume and mix of 42 million largely the result of higher citation jet volume of 165 million partially offset by lower turboprop volume

·   lower bell revenues of 215 million primarily due to a decrease in commercial revenues of 269 million largely reflecting lower aircraft deliveries

  

revenues decreased 455 million 3 in 2015 compared with 2014 as decreases in the bell and textron systems segments were partially offset by higher revenues in the textron aviation and industrial segments the net revenue decrease included the following factors 

  

·   lower bell revenues of 791 million largely due to a decrease of 577 million in v22 program revenues primarily reflecting lower aircraft deliveries a decrease of 193 million in commercial revenues largely related to a change in mix of commercial aircraft sold during the period and lower commercial aftermarket volume of 92 million

·   lower textron systems revenues of 104 million primarily due to lower volume in the unmanned systems product line largely reflecting lower deliveries in the fourth quarter

·   higher textron aviation revenues of 254 million primarily due to the first quarter impact of the beechcraft acquisition of 219 million and higher volume and mix of 35 million we completed the acquisition of beechcraft on march 14 2014 and as a result 2014 does not reflect a full twelve months of its revenues

·   higher industrial segment revenues of 206 million primarily due to higher volume of 357 million largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line and the impact from acquisitions of 103 million partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 240 million

  

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

in 2016 cost of sales increased 332 million 3 compared with 2015 largely due to higher volume at the textron systems industrial and textron aviation segments and an increase from acquired businesses these increases were partially offset by lower volume at the bell segment and favorable cost performance across all of our manufacturing segments selling and administrative expense was unchanged in 2016 compared with 2015 

  

cost of sales decreased 442 million 4 in 2015 compared with 2014 largely due to lower volume at the bell segment and a 217 million favorable foreign exchange impact mostly from the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro partially offset by higher volume at the industrial segment and an increase from acquired businesses primarily beechcraft the 60 basispoint improvement in gross margin was largely driven by the textron aviation segment primarily reflecting the net impact of the beechcraft acquisition which includes the benefit of the integrated cost structure of beechcraft and cessna and lower amortization of fair value stepup adjustments related to acquired beechcraft inventories

  

selling and administrative expense decreased 57 million 4 in 2015 compared with 2014 significant factors contributing to the decrease in expense include a favorable impact from ongoing cost reduction activities at the bell segment and lower sharebased compensation expense of 22 million which were partially offset by an increase from acquired businesses primarily beechcraft 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest consolidated interest expense increased 5 million 3 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2015 consolidated interest expense decreased 22 million 12 compared with 2014 primarily due to favorable borrowing costs and lower average debt outstanding 

  

special charges 

special charges recorded in 2016 by segment are as follows 

  

   

in 2016 we initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall operating efficiency across textron as part of this plan textron systems will discontinue production of its sensorfuzed weapon product by the end of the first quarter of 2017  resulting in headcount reductions facility consolidations and asset impairments within its weapons and sensors operating unit historically sensorfuzed weapon sales have relied on foreign military and direct commercial international customers for which both executive branch and congressional approval is required the political environment has made it difficult to obtain these approvals within our industrial segment the plan provides for the combination of our jacobsen business with the textron specialized vehicles businesses resulting in the consolidation of certain facilities and general and administrative functions and related headcount reductions in addition we initiated restructuring actions principally headcount reductions in our textron aviation segment as well as other businesses and corporate 

  

  

functions the total headcount reduction related to restructuring activities is expected to be approximately 1700 positions representing approximately 5 of our workforce 

  

we expect to incur additional pretax charges under this plan in the range of 17 million to 47 million primarily related to contract termination severance facility consolidation and relocation costs the remaining charges are expected to primarily be in the industrial textron systems and textron aviation segments we anticipate the plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first half of 2017 total expected cash outlays for restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately 100 million to 120 million of which 22 million was paid in 2016 and the remainder will be paid in 2017 

  

in 2014 we executed a restructuring program in our textron aviation segment to align the cessna and acquired beechcraft business reduce operating redundancies and maximize operating efficiencies we recorded special charges of 41 million related to these restructuring activities in 2014 along with 11 million of transaction costs from the acquisition of beechcraft 

  

income taxes 

  

   

in 2016 our effective tax rate was significantly lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 largely due to a settlement with the us internal revenue service office of appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years this settlement resulted in a 206 million benefit recognized in continuing operations and a 113 million benefit in discontinued operations for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments textron aviation bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenues represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelvemonth period for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

approximately 25 of our 2016 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are described in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

  

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate 

  

in 2016 textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2021 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit at december 31 2016 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 11 million of letters of credit issued against it this facility replaced the existing 5year facility which had no outstanding borrowings and was scheduled to expire in october 2018 

  

we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities in march 2016 we issued 350 million in 40 notes due march 2026 under this registration statement

in 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities was 988 million compared with 1038 million in 2015 a 5 decrease this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital which included lower customer deposits of 257 million largely related to performancebased payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment along with a 34 million reduction in dividends received from the finance group these decreases were partially offset by a 75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporateowned life insurance policies and 42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities was 1038 million in 2015 compared with 1097 million in 2014 a 5 decrease this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of 94 million 

  

  

and dividends received from the finance group of 63 million in 2015 a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of 304 million at textron aviation largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries

  

net tax payments were 163 million 187 million and 266 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively p ension contributions were 50 million 68 million and 76 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

on january 25 2017 we announced the adoption of a new plan authorizing the repurchase of up to 25 million shares under which we intend to purchase shares of textron common stock to offset the impact of dilution from sharebased compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes this new plan has no expiration date and replaced the existing plan adopted in 2013 that had 40 million remaining shares available for repurchase 

  

dividends 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 22 million 22 million and 28 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment dividends paid by the finance group were 29 million and 63 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

  

   

in 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities was 1014 million compared with 1094 million in 2015 a 7 decrease this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital which included lower customer deposits of 257 million largely related to performancebased payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment these decreases were partially offset by a 75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporateowned life insurance policies and 42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities was 1094 million in 2015 compared with 1211 million in 2014 a 10 decrease this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of 93 million a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of 304 million at textron aviation largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries

  

net tax payments were 174 million 198 million and 289 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively p ension contributions were 50 million 68 million and 76 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and preowned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

  

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement which was amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2016 2015 and 2014 to maintain compliance with the support agreement 

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 31 2016 

  

   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2017 we expect to make approximately 28 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2018 through 2021 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 75 million to 150 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 38 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of december 31 2016 

  

   

at december 31 2016 the finance group also had 79 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended december 31 2016 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2016 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 758 compared with 757 in 2015 for the last five years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 91 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50 basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2016 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 30 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2016 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 466 compared with 425 in 2015 for our domestic plans the 

  

  

assumed discount rate was 475 in 2016 compared with 425 in 2015 a 50 basispoint decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 33 million in 2016 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2016 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2016 we assumed a trend rate of 725 for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 50 by 2024 and then remain at that level see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately 665 million and 706 million at the end of 2016 and 2015 respectively foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased both revenues and segment profit in 2016 by 36 million and 12 million respectively and in 2015 by 244 million and 20 million respectively the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and segment profit for 2014 was not significant 

  

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities 

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding capital lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

  

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

with the participation of our management we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on our evaluation under the 2013 framework we have concluded that textron inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 

  

the independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has audited the consolidated financial statements of textron inc and has issued an attestation report on textron’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 as stated in its report which is included herein 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the board of directors and shareholders of textron inc 

  

we have audited textron inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria textron inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion textron inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on the coso criteria 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of textron inc as of december 31 2016 and january 2 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016 of textron inc and our report dated february 22 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2015 we derived approximately 24 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

under the budget control act of 2011 the us government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if for example the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result our customer does not pay us on a timely basis we would need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our other resources an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount net of the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and 

  

  

associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations additionally us government procurement policies increasingly favor fixedprice incentivebased fee arrangements rather than traditional fixedprice contracts these fee arrangements could negatively impact our profitability other current us government policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example the government has expressed a preference for requiring progress payments rather than performance based payments on new fixedprice contracts which if implemented delays our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly t here is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected  

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures 

  

  

collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a majority of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of these security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated an it system failure issues related to implementation of new it systems or breach of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs and could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately 

  

  

protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

during 2015 we derived approximately 38 of our revenues from international business including us exports and we expect international revenues to continue to increase conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments risks related to international operations include import export and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases technology transfers manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cybersecurity threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7200 or 28 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase 

  

  

derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below a more detailed analysis of our segments’ operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 20 to 27 

  

revenues 

  

   

revenues decreased 455 million 3 in 2015 compared with 2014 as decreases in the bell and textron systems segments were partially offset by higher revenues in the textron aviation and industrial segments the net revenue decrease included the following factors 

  

   

revenues increased 18 billion 15 in 2014 compared with 2013 as increases in the textron aviation and industrial segments were partially offset by lower revenues in the bell textron systems and finance segments the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher textron aviation revenues of 18 billion primarily due to a 15 billion impact from the beechcraft acquisition and a 263 million increase in volume largely related to citation jets 

·   higher industrial segment revenues of 326 million primarily due to 181 million in higher volume largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line and a 142 million impact from acquisitions 

·   lower bell revenues of 266 million largely due to a 183 million decrease in commercial revenues reflecting lower sales activity across the commercial helicopter market and 99 million in lower other military volume  largely related to the h1 program reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and production support

·   lower textron systems revenues of 41 million primarily due to lower volume of 233 million in the marine and land systems product line reflecting lower vehicle deliveries partially offset by higher volume of 130 million in the unmanned systems product line and a 62 million impact from acquisitions

·   lower finance revenues of 29 million primarily attributable to gains on the disposition of finance receivables held for sale during 2013 

  

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses cost of sales decreased 442 million 4 in 2015 compared with 2014 largely due to lower volume at the bell segment and a 217 million favorable foreign exchange impact mostly from the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro partially offset by higher volume at the industrial segment and an increase from acquired businesses primarily beechcraft the 60 basispoint improvement in gross margin was largely driven by the textron aviation segment primarily reflecting the net impact of the beechcraft acquisition which includes the benefit of the integrated cost structure of beechcraft and cessna and lower amortization of fair value stepup adjustments related to acquired beechcraft inventories

  

selling and administrative expense decreased 57 million 4 in 2015 compared with 2014 significant factors contributing to the decrease in expense include a favorable impact from ongoing cost reduction activities at the bell segment and lower sharebased compensation expense of 22 million which were partially offset by an increase from acquired businesses primarily beechcraft 

  

manufacturing cost of sales increased 13 billion 13 in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to the impact of acquired businesses primarily beechcraft in 2014 gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased 170 basispoints largely due to improved leverage resulting from higher revenues primarily at the textron aviation segment 

  

s elling and administrative expense increased 235 million 21 in 2014 compared with 2013 largely related to businesses acquired in the past year and compensation expense these increases were partially offset by 28 million in severance costs incurred in 2013 in connection with a voluntary separation program at the textron aviation segment

  

acquisition and restructuring costs 

in 2014 we executed a restructuring program in our textron aviation segment to align the cessna and beechcraft businesses reduce operating redundancies and maximize efficiencies during 2014 we recorded charges of 41 million related to these restructuring activities along with 11 million of transaction costs which were included in the acquisition and restructuring costs line on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest consolidated interest expense decreased 22 million 12 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to favorable borrowing costs and lower average debt outstanding in 2014 consolidated interest expense increased 18 million 10 compared with 2013 primarily due to a 31 million impact related to financing the beechcraft acquisition partially offset by 9 million of lower interest expense due to the maturity of our convertible notes in the second quarter of 2013

  

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 281 291 and 261 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively this rate generally differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 due to certain earnings from operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world as well as the domestic manufacturing deduction and the research and development credit the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include canada germany united kingdom belgium and china we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the us 

  

  

in 2013 our effective tax rate was reduced by approximately 40 due to the tax benefit recognized upon the retroactive reinstatement and extension of the federal research and development tax credit for the period from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 this credit was subsequently extended in 2014 and in 2015 resulting in a 15 reduction in our effective tax rate for each year 

  

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments textron aviation bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and acquisition and restructuring costs related to the beechcraft acquisition the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenues represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelvemonth period for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

approximately 24 of our 2015 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

finance segment revenues decreased 29 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily attributable to a 31 million impact from gains on the disposition of finance receivables held for sale during 2013 these gains resulted from the payoff of loans in amounts 

  

  

and sale of loans at prices in excess of the values established in previous periods 

  

finance segment profit 

finance segment profit increased 3 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to lower provision for loan losses 

  

finance segment profit decreased 28 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a change in provision for loan losses of 29 million largely reflecting reserve reversals in 2013 primarily related to the noncaptive business and the impact from gains on finance receivables held for sale as described above these decreases in segment profit were partially offset by lower administrative expense of 19 million in 2014 primarily associated with the exit of the noncaptive business

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate 

  

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit at january 2 2016 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 33 million of letters of credit issued against it we also maintain an effective shelf

manufacturing group cash flows 

  

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

   

cash flows provided by operating activities was 1038 million in 2015 compared with 1097 million in 2014 a decrease of 5 this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of 94 million and dividends received from the finance group of 63 million in 2015 a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of 304 million at textron aviation largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries

  

cash flows from operating activities increased 439 million during 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to a change in working capital higher income from continuing operations of 120 million and lower contributions of 118 million to our pension plans partially offset by 175 million of dividends received from the finance group in 2013 working capital was favorably impacted by an increase of 226 million in customer deposits primarily at textron aviation and a 174 million increase in cash from accounts receivable largely at bell partially offset by an increase in net tax payments of 43 million 

  

net tax payments were 187 million 266 million and 223 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively p ension contributions were 68 million 76 million and 194 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

   

in 2015 2014 and 2013 the finance group’s cash flows from operating activities were primarily impacted by changes in net taxes paidreceived net tax paymentsreceipts were 11 million 23 million and 49 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

  

cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables and proceeds from sales of receivables and other finance assets totaling 389 million 499 million and 853 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively partially offset by financial receivable originations of 194 million 215 million and 271 million respectively

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

   

cash flows provided by operating activities was 1094 million in 2015 compared with 1211 million in 2014 a decrease of 10 this decrease was largely due to a change in working capital partially offset by higher income from continuing operations of 93 million a significant factor contributing to the decrease in cash flows related to working capital was a reduction in customer deposits of 304 million at textron aviation largely reflecting advance deposits received on military contracts in 2014 for 2015 deliveries

  

cash flows from operating activities increased 398 million during 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to a change in working capital lower contributions of 118 million to our pension plans and higher income from continuing operations of 107 million working capital was favorably impacted by an increase of 226 million in customer deposits primarily at textron aviation and a 174 million increase in cash from accounts receivable largely at bell partially offset by an increase in net tax payments of 115 million and lower net cash receipts from captive finance receivables of 87 million

  

net tax payments were 198 million 289 million and 174 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

cash flows from investing activities included capital expenditures of 420 million 429 million and 444 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2014 cash flows from investing activities also included a 15 billion aggregate cash payment to acquire beechcraft collections on finance receivables and proceeds from sales of receivables and other finance assets totaled 105 million 134 million and 368 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and preowned aircraft and helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

  

reclassification adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement which was amended in december 2015 also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 125 million there were no cash contributions required to be paid to tfc in 2015 2014 and 2013 to maintain compliance with the support agreement 

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 2 2016 

  

   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2016 we expect to make approximately 33 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution for each of the years from 2017 through 2020 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 60 million to 125 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience certain other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

  

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 30 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of january 2 2016 

  

   

securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 

  

at january 2 2016 the finance group also had 28 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended january 2 2016 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2015 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 757 compared with 760 in 2014 for the last four years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 91 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50 basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2015 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 29 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2015 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 425 compared with 492 in 2014 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 425 in 2015 compared with 500 for 2014 in the second quarter of 2015 our bell segment announced cost reduction actions that resulted in a headcount reduction that was deemed a curtailment as a result we remeasured bell’s pension plan incorporating a 50 basispoint increase in our discount rate to 475 a 50 basispoint decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate that includes the remeasurement would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately 34 million in 2015 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2015 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2015 we assumed a trend rate of 750 for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 500 by 2024 and then remain at that level see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately 706 million and 696 million at the end of 2015 and 2014 respectively foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased both revenues and segment profit in 2015 by 244 million and 20 million respectively the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and segment profit for 2014 and 2013 was not significant 

  

  

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities 

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading the financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding capital lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts to quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 

  

at the end of each year the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 

  

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 2 2016 the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions under the supervision of our chairman president and chief executive officer ceo and our executive vice president and chief financial officer cfo based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating and effective as of january 2 2016 

  

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for textron inc as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f our internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable assurance at appropriate cost that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded the internal control structure includes among other things established policies and procedures an internal audit function the selection and training of qualified personnel as well as management oversight 

  

with the participation of our management we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on our evaluation under the 2013 framework we have concluded that textron inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2016 

  

the independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has audited the consolidated financial statements of textron inc and has issued an attestation report on textron’s internal controls over financial reporting as of january 2 2016 as stated in its report which is included herein 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the board of directors and shareholders of textron inc 

  

we have audited textron inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2016 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria textron inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion textron inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2016 based on the coso criteria 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of textron inc as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended january 2 2016 of textron inc and our report dated february 24 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2014 we derived approximately 28 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the us government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

under the budget control act of 2011 the us government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our us government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if for example the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result our customer does not pay us on a timely basis we would need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our other resources an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount net of the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and 

  

  

associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations additionally us government procurement policies increasingly favor fixedprice incentivebased fee arrangements rather than traditional fixedprice contracts these fee arrangements could negatively impact our profitability other current us government policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example the government has expressed a preference for requiring progress payments rather than performance based payments on new fixedprice contracts which if implemented delays our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and could adversely affect our financial results 

demand for business jets turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast therefore future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated andor less than previous period deliveries similarly there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or cancelled reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

if our finance segment is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected  

a key determinant of the financial performance of our finance segment is the quality of loans leases and other assets in its portfolio portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures 

  

  

collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions in addition a majority of the new originations in our finance receivable portfolio are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the us crossborder transactions present additional challenges and risks in realizing upon collateral in the event of borrower default which may result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables if our finance segment has difficulty successfully collecting its finance receivable portfolio our cash flow results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues including delays in production shipments or other business operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers as well as other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of these security threats the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated an it system failure issues related to implementation of new it systems or breach of data security whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs and could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately 

  

  

protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

conducting business internationally including us exports exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments we expect that our international business and our investment in emerging market countries will continue to increase risks related to international operations include import export and other trade restrictions changing us and foreign procurement policies and practices restrictions on technology transfer difficulties in protecting intellectual property increasing complexity of employment and environmental health and safety regulations foreign investment laws exchange controls repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages economic and government instability acts of terrorism and related safety concerns the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are typically subjective we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis for example we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the us both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels changes in environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions such as denial of import or export privileges andor debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and 

  

  

regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cybersecurity threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate would increase the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits moreover we expect that some of the requirements of the new comprehensive healthcare law will increase our future costs increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 7100 or 28 of our us employees are unionized and many of our nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted 

  

  

jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to oems we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 manage m ent’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview and consolidated results of operations 

  

our revenues increased 15 in 2014 reflecting the success of our strategy of investing in new products and complementary acquisitions several highlights of the year include the following 

  

·   invested 694 million in research and development activities demonstrating our continued commitment to expand our current product lines across our businesses 

·   invested 16 billion in strategic acquisitions along with 429 million in capital expenditures 

·   delivered strong cash flow performance as manufacturing operating cash flows from continuing operations increased 67 to 11 billion 

·   grew segment profit by 26 to 12 billion 

·   raised diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 23 

  

on march 14 2014 we completed the acquisition of beech holdings llc which included beechcraft corporation and other subsidiaries collectively “beechcraft” this business and the legacy cessna segment were combined to form a new segment named textron aviation we also made seven acquisitions in the industrial and textron systems segments which complemented our products and services the results of these acquisitions are included in textron’s consolidated financial statements only for the period subsequent to the completion of each acquisition and do not reflect a full year of operations 

  

an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below a more detailed analysis of our segments’ operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 to 28 

  

revenues 

  

   

revenues increased 18 billion 15 in 2014 compared with 2013 as increases in the textron aviation and industrial segments were partially offset by lower revenues in the bell textron systems and finance segments the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher textron aviation revenues of 18 billion primarily due to a 15 billion impact from the beechcraft acquisition and a 263 million increase in volume largely related to citation jets 

·   higher industrial segment revenues of 326 million primarily due to 181 million in higher volume largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line and a 142 million impact from acquisitions 

·   lower bell revenues of 266 million largely due to a 183 million decrease in commercial revenues reflecting lower sales activity across the commercial helicopter market and 99 million in lower other military volume largely related to the h1 program reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and production support 

·   lower textron systems revenues of 41 million primarily due to lower volume of 233 million in the marine and land systems product line reflecting lower vehicle deliveries partially offset by higher volume of 130 million in the unmanned systems product line and a 62 million impact from acquisitions 

·   lower finance revenues of 29 million primarily attributable to gains on the disposition of finance receivables held for sale during 2013 

  

revenues decreased 133 million 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 as decreases in the textron aviation finance and textron systems segments were partially offset by higher revenues in the bell and industrial segments the net revenue decrease included the following factors 

  

·   lower textron aviation revenues of 327 million primarily due to lower citation jet volume of 384 million and citationair volume of 114 million partially offset by higher aftermarket volume of 65 million and higher preowned aircraft volume of 53 million 

  

  

·   lower finance revenues of 83 million primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact of 46 million from lower average finance receivables and a decrease of 25 million in revenues related to the resolution of a timeshare account in 2012 

·   lower textron systems revenues of 72 million largely due to lower volume of 51 million in the marine and land systems product line and lower volume of 28 million in the unmanned systems product line 

·   higher bell revenues of 237 million largely due to higher volume of 163 million in our military programs primarily reflecting higher v22 deliveries and aftermarket volume and 74 million of higher commercial revenues largely due to higher aircraft volume 

·   higher industrial segment revenues of 112 million primarily due to higher volume of 58 million and the impact from acquisitions of 46 million 

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses cost of sales increased 13 billion 13 in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to the impact of acquired businesses primarily beechcraft in 2014 gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased 170 basis points largely due to improved leverage resulting from higher revenues primarily at textron aviation 

  

selling and administrative expense increased 235 million 21 in 2014 compared with 2013 largely related to businesses acquired in the past year and compensation expense these increases were partially offset by 28 million in severance costs incurred in 2013 in connection with a voluntary separation program at textron aviation 

  

manufacturing cost of sales increased 112 million 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher volume at bell and the impact from businesses acquired in 2013 partially offset by lower sales at textron aviation and textron systems in 2013 gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 130 basis points primarily due to unfavorable performance at bell largely due to manufacturing inefficiencies associated with labor disruptions resulting from negotiations with bargained employees and with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in the first quarter of 2013 as well as lower citation jet and citiationair volume at textron aviation 

  

selling and administrative expenses decreased 39 million 3 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to a reduction in administrative expenses of 26 million and lower provision for loan losses of 20 million at the finance segment both primarily associated with the noncaptive business selling and administrative expense was also impacted by 28 million in severance costs incurred in 2013 at textron aviation which were largely offset by a 27 million charge from an unfavorable arbitration award in 2012 at textron aviation 

  

acquisition and restructuring costs 

in connection with the integration of beechcraft we initiated a restructuring program in our textron aviation segment in the first quarter of 2014 to align the cessna and beechcraft businesses reduce operating redundancies and maximize efficiencies during 2014 we recorded charges of 41 million related to these restructuring activities that were included in the acquisition and restructuring costs line on the consolidated statements of operations in addition we incurred transaction costs of 11 million in 2014 related to the acquisition that were also included in the acquisition and restructuring costs line we expect to incur additional restructuring costs in 2015 but do not expect these costs to be material 

  

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the manufacturing and finance borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated consolidated interest expense increased 18 million 10 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a 31 million impact related to financing the beechcraft acquisition partially offset by 9 million of lower interest expense due to the maturity of our convertible notes in the second quarter of 2013 in 2013 consolidated interest expense decreased 39 million 18 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding 

  

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 291 in 2014 261 in 2013 and 309 in 2012 this rate generally differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 due to certain earnings from operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world as well as the research credit the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include canada germany belgium and china we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the us 

  

in 2013 our effective tax rate was reduced by approximately 40 due to the tax benefit recognized upon the retroactive reinstatement and extension of the federal research and development tax credit for the period from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 in 2014 this credit was extended through the end of 2014 resulting in a 15 reduction in our effective tax rate 

  

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments textron aviation which consists of the legacy cessna segment combined with the recentlyacquired beechcraft business bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and acquisition and restructuring costs related to the beechcraft acquisition the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenues represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refers to the revenues generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

approximately 28 of our 2014 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

textron aviation revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2014 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

textron aviation’s revenues increased by 18 billion 64 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the impact of the beechcraft acquisition of 15 billion and higher volume of 263 million the increase in volume was primarily the result of higher citation jet volume of 344 million partially offset by lower citationair volume of 78 million related to exiting our fractional share business we delivered 159 citation jets and 113 king air turboprops in 2014 compared with 139 citation jets in 2013 during 2014 the portion of the segment’s revenues derived from aftermarket sales and services represented 30 of its total revenues compared with 33 in 2013 

  

textron aviation’s operating expenses increased by 15 billion 53 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the incremental operating costs related to the beechcraft acquisition and higher net volume as described above textron aviation’s operating expenses exclude acquisition and restructuring costs incurred across the segment as a result of the beechcraft integration which are reported separately and are discussed in the acquisition and restructuring costs section above 

  

factors contributing to the 2013 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

in 2013 textron aviation’s revenues decreased 327 million 11 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower citation jet volume of 384 million and lower citationair volume of 114 million largely related to the winddown of our fractional share business these decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket volume of 65 million largely due to increased service demand and higher preowned aircraft volume of 53 million we delivered 139 citation jets in 2013 compared with 181 jets in 2012 during 2013 the portion of textron aviation’s revenues derived from aftermarket sales and services increased to 33 compared with 25 in 2012 due to higher aftermarket volume and the impact of lower citation jet revenues 

  

textron aviation’s operating expenses decreased 197 million 7 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower volume as discussed above the volumerelated decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by 37 million of operating costs incurred by service centers acquired at the beginning of 2013 and 33 million of inflation largely due to higher pension expense of 17 million operating expenses in 2013 were also impacted by 28 million in severance costs incurred during the first half of the year in connection with a voluntary separation program offered to qualifying salaried employees and a reduction of certain direct production positions due to an adjustment of our production schedule operating expenses in 2012 included a 27 million charge from an unfavorable arbitration award 

  

  

textron aviation segment profit loss 

factors contributing to 2014 yearoveryear segment profit loss change are provided below 

  

   

textron aviation segment profit increased 282 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in performance and other higher volume as described above favorable pricing and inflation and 28 million in severance costs incurred in 2013 during the second quarter of 2014 the cost structures of beechcraft and cessna were significantly integrated and as a result performance and other reflects the net profit impact of beechcraft including the benefit of the integrated cost structure performance and other also includes amortization of 63 million in 2014 related to fair value stepup adjustments of acquired inventories sold during the periods 

  

factors contributing to 2013 yearoveryear segment profit loss change are provided below

bell 

  

   

bell’s major us government programs at this time are the v22 tiltrotor aircraft and the h1 helicopter platforms which are both in the production stage and represent a significant portion of bell’s revenues from the us government 

  

  

bell revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2014 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

bell’s revenues decreased 266 million 6 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the following factors

industrial revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2014 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

industrial segment revenues increased 326 million 11 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher volume of 181 million and the impact from acquisitions of 142 million primarily within our specialized vehicles and equipment product line higher volume resulted from a 142 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components product line principally reflecting automotive industry demand in north america and europe and a 39 million increase in the other industrial product lines 

  

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 288 million 10 in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to the impact from higher volume as described above and additional operating expenses from recently acquired businesses 

  

factors contributing to the 2013 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

industrial segment revenues increased 112 million 4 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to higher volume of 58 million and the impact from acquisitions of 46 million within our tools and test equipment product line higher volume resulted from a 32 million increase in the other industrial product lines mostly due to higher market demand in the specialized vehicles and equipment product line and a 26 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components line reflecting higher automotive industry demand in north america 

  

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 85 million 3 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to higher volume and a 43 million impact from acquisitions operating expenses were also impacted by improved performance of 27 million associated with the fuel systems and functional components product line which was partially offset by 16 million of inflation in this product line reflecting higher compensation and material costs

finance 

   

finance revenues 

finance segment revenues decreased 29 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily attributable to a 31 million impact from gains on the disposition of finance receivables held for sale during 2013 these gains resulted from the payoff of loans in amounts and sale of loans at prices in excess of the values established in previous periods 

  

finance segment revenues decreased 83 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact of 46 million attributable to lower average finance receivables of 834 million revenues during 2013 were also lower by 25 million due to the resolution of a timeshare account that returned to accrual status in 2012 

  

finance segment profit 

finance segment profit decreased 28 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a change in provision for loan losses of 29 million largely reflecting reserve reversals in 2013 primarily related to the noncaptive business and the impact from gains on finance receivables held for sale described above these decreases in segment profit were partially offset by lower administrative expense of 19 million in 2014 primarily associated with the exit of the noncaptive business 

  

finance segment profit decreased 15 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily resulting from the resolution of a timeshare account in 2012 as described above as well as an unfavorable impact of 25 million in net interest margin from lower average finance receivables these decreases were partially offset by lower administrative expenses of 26 million and lower provision for loan losses of 20 million largely related to the downsizing of the noncaptive business 

  

finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables 

   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate 

  

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit at january 3 2015 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 35 million of letters of credits issued against it 

  

we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that authorizes us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities under this shelf registration statement in january 2014 we issued 250 million of 365 notes due 2021 and 350 million of 430 notes due 2024 we also entered into a fiveyear term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the principal amount of 500 million upon the closing of the beechcraft acquisition on march 14 2014 we fully drew down on the fiveyear term loan and used the cash along with the net proceeds of the notes issued to finance a portion of the acquisition the balance of the beechcraft acquisition purchase price was paid from cash on hand during the third quarter of 2014 we repaid 200 million of the fiveyear term loan also under the shelf registration statement in november 2014 we issued 350 million of 3875 notes due 2025 subsequently prior to yearend we prepaid 350 million of 62 notes which were due in march 2015 

  

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

   

cash flows from operating activities increased 439 million during 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to a favorable change in working capital higher income from continuing operations of 120 million and lower contributions of 118 million to our pension plans partially offset by 175 million of dividends received from the finance group in 2013 working capital was 

  

  

favorably impacted by an increase of 226 million in customer deposits primarily at textron aviation and a 174 million increase in cash from accounts receivable largely at bell partially offset by an increase in net tax payments of 43 million net tax payments were 266 million and 223 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

we generated 658 million in cash from operating activities in 2013 on 914 million in manufacturing group segment profit and 470 million of income from continuing operations the 300 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2012 was largely due to a 429 million impact related to working capital requirements and 64 million in lower income from continuing operations which were partially offset by 211 million in lower contributions to our pension plans in 2013 the most significant change within working capital was a 230 million unfavorable impact resulting from net tax payments of 223 million in 2013 compared to net tax refunds of 7 million in 2012 in addition we had 165 million in cash inflows related to changes in inventory levels largely at textron aviation which was more than offset by 264 million of cash outflows from changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable the change in inventory levels at textron aviation was primarily related to lower preowned inventory partially offset by higher inventory in support of new sales 

  

pension contributions were 76 million 194 million and 405 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

in 2014 cash flows from investing activities included a 16 billion aggregate cash payment for beechcraft and seven other acquisitions within our industrial and textron systems segments cash flows from investing activities in 2013 included 196 million of cash used for acquisitions of businesses within our industrial and textron systems segments and two service centers in our textron aviation segment cash flows from investing activities also included capital expenditures of 429 million 444 million and 480 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

cash flows from financing activities in 2014 included proceeds from longterm debt of 14 billion most of which was used to finance a portion of the beechcraft acquisition partially offset by the repayment of 559 million of outstanding debt in 2013 cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of 528 million of outstanding debt including the settlement of our convertible notes which was partially offset by proceeds from longterm debt of 150 million in 2012 we generated cash from financing activities largely due to the receipt of 490 million from the finance group in payment of its intergroup borrowing partially offset by 272 million in share repurchases and 189 million in payments on our outstanding debt 

  

dividends 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 28 million 22 million and 17 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

share repurchases 

during 2014 under a 2013 share repurchase authorization we repurchased an aggregate of 89 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 340 million in 2012 under a 2007 share repurchase authorization we repurchased 111 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 272 million 

  

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million cash contributions paid to tfc to maintain compliance with the support agreement and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 

   

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statements of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

  

  

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

   

in 2014 and 2013 the finance group’s cash flows from operating activities were primarily impacted by changes in net taxes paidreceived net tax paymentsreceipts were 23 million 49 million and 43 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

cash flows from investing activities primarily included finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales of receivables and other finance assets totaling 499 million 853 million and 13 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively partially offset by financial receivable originations of 215 million 271 million and 331 million respectively 

  

cash used in financing activities included payments on longterm and nonrecourse debt of 345 million 743 million and 426 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively which were partially offset by proceeds from longterm debt of 128 million 298 million and 106 million respectively in 2013 and 2012 dividend payments to the manufacturing group net of capital contributions received totaled 174 million and 105 million respectively in 2012 the finance group also made cash payments of 493 million to the manufacturing group related to intergroup borrowings 

  

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

   

cash flows from operating activities increased 398 million during 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to a favorable change in working capital lower contributions of 118 million to our pension plans and higher income from continuing operations of 107 million working capital was favorably impacted by an increase of 226 million in customer deposits primarily at textron aviation and a 174 million increase in cash from accounts receivable largely at bell partially offset by an increase in net tax payments of 115 million and lower net cash receipts from captive finance receivables of 87 million net tax payments were 289 million and 174 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

during 2013 cash flows from operating activities decreased 122 million compared with 2012 largely due to a 133 million impact related to working capital requirements and lower earnings which were partially offset by a 206 million impact of lower contributions to our pension plans in 2013 significant changes within working capital included a 138 million unfavorable impact resulting from net taxes paid between the periods as net tax payments were 174 million and 36 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and 264 million of cash outflows related to changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable these cash outflows were partially offset by 198 million of cash inflows related to changes in inventory levels largely at textron aviation and a 141 million impact from lower captive finance receivables 

  

in 2014 cash flows from investing activities included a 16 billion aggregate cash payment for beechcraft and seven other acquisitions within our industrial and textron systems segments cash flows from investing activities in 2013 included 196 million of cash used for acquisitions of businesses within our industrial and textron systems segments and two service centers in our textron aviation segment cash flows from investing activities also included capital expenditures of 429 million 444 million and 480 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively collections on finance receivables and proceeds from sales of finance receivables and other finance assets totaled 134 million 368 million and 848 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 

  

cash flows from financing activities in 2014 included proceeds of 16 billion from longterm debt most of which was used to finance a portion of the beechcraft acquisition partially offset by the repayment of 904 million of outstanding debt in 2013 and 2012 financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of outstanding longterm debt of 13 billion and 617 million respectively partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 448 million and 106 million respectively cash used in financing activities also included 340 million and 272 million of share repurchases in 2014 and 2012 respectively 

  

  

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and preowned aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 3 2015 

  

   

pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2015 we expect to make approximately 54 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2016 through 2019 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 65 million to 155 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

  

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 3 2015 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 33 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of january 3 2015 

  

   

securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 

  

at january 3 2015 the finance group also had 33 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended january 3 2015 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

  

based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2014 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 760 compared with 756 in 2013 for the last three years the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2014 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 27 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2014 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 492 compared with 423 in 2013 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 500 in 2014 compared with 425 for 2013 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2014 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 29 million 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2014 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits in 2014 we assumed a trend rate of 660 for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would decrease to 500 by 2021 and then remain at that level see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

warranty and product maintenance liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

  

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where 

  

  

applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately 696 million and 636 million at the end of 2014 and 2013 respectively the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and segment profit for 2014 and 2013 from the prior year was not significant 

  

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities 

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk include finance receivables excluding leases debt excluding lease obligations and foreign currency exchange contracts 

  

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar 

  

   

 the value represents an asset or liability

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2013 we derived approximately 30 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we are at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction termination or delay in the timing of funding for us government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services may result in a loss of anticipated future revenues that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

under the budget control act of 2011 the us government committed to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years notwithstanding the bipartisan budget control act of 2013 substantial spending cuts to the us defense budget are likely in the future in addition congress and the administration continue to debate the nation’s debt ceiling and other fiscal issues the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs 

  

there are many variables in how these budget cuts could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result the us government does not pay us on a timely basis we would need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our available cash resources credit facilities andor access to the capital markets if available an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to liability for reprocurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount net of the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us 

  

  

government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts for convenience or default could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition in the event that the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations as well as changes in the department of defense dod acquisition practices 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

in addition the dod’s “better buying power initiative” which provides guidance for its acquisition workforce to obtain greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending significantly affects the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers and could have a significant impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and if so how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts that are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs incurred in performing under the contract our cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

weak demand for our aircraft products may continue to adversely affect our financial results 

continued worldwide economic softness has adversely impacted the business jet market in recent years as a result we have experienced continued weak demand for our fixedwing aircraft particularly our business jets soft demand for our jets could persist and could continue to adversely impact the pricing of new jets and the valuation of preowned jets which comprise a significant portion of our inventory a prolonged weakness in the markets for our aircraft products could adversely impact our results of operations and our future prospects 

  

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or that may result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions and the potential loss of key customers suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may prevent the consummation of the acquisition or divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

on december 26 2013 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which we will acquire all outstanding equity interests in beech holdings llc “beech” the parent of beechcraft corporation for approximately 14 billion in cash each of the foregoing risks may impact the success of the beech acquisition we plan to finance the purchase of the equity in beech and the repayment of beech’s outstanding debt which is required at closing through a combination of available cash at beech and textron and up to 11 billion in new debt while we believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to complete the transaction it is possible that unanticipated cash requirements for working capital or other business needs either at beech or at textron could cause us to incur borrowings in excess of what we currently anticipate 

  

difficult economic conditions could continue to affect the performance of our finance segment and our losses may increase if we are unable to successfully collect our finance receivables or realize sufficient value from collateral 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions on our customers’ businesses valuations of the types of collateral securing our finance asset portfolio particularly valuations of preowned aircraft have decreased over recent years and may continue to decrease if weak economic conditions continue declining collateral values could result in greater delinquencies credit losses and foreclosures if customers elect to discontinue payments on loan balances that exceed asset values bankruptcy proceedings involving our borrowers may prevent or delay our ability to exercise our rights and remedies and realize the full value of our collateral 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due to support our operations andor to make acquisitions although we currently have access to the capital markets our access and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats 

our information technology it and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations from time to time we update andor replace it systems used by our businesses the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems resulting in productivity issues delays in production shipments or other business operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global it infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our it infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to information and other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources while we have experienced cyber attacks we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust due to the evolving nature of these security threats the possibility of any future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated an it system failure issues related to implementation of new it systems or breach of data security could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources and increased costs and could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed changes in environmental laws and regulations for example those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews we also could be adversely affected if our research and development investments are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

conducting business internationally including us exports exposes us to different and additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the us our exposure to such risks increases as our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices which may change from time to time including regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer environmental health and safety investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks these international risks may be especially significant with respect to aerospace and defense products for which we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside the us any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside the us could negatively impact our results of operations additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements which could adversely impact our results of operations additionally we are facing increasing competition in our international markets from foreign and multinational firms that may have certain home country advantages over us as a result our ability to compete successfully in those markets may be adversely affected which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

  

  

we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments we expect that our investment in emerging market countries will continue to increase emerging market operations can present many risks in addition to those discussed above including civil disturbances economic and government instability terrorism and related safety concerns cultural differences in employment and business practices difficulties in protecting intellectual property and the imposition of exchange controls the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry and they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations adversely impact demand for our products andor limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and debarment as a government contractor these improper actions could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cyber threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be 

  

  

unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate would increase the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits moreover we expect that some of the requirements of the new comprehensive healthcare law will increase our future costs increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 6000 of our us employees or 26 of our total us employees are unionized and approximately 2900 of our nonus employees or 32 of our total nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

revenues 

   

revenues decreased 133 million 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 as revenue decreases in the cessna finance and textron systems segments were partially offset by higher revenues in the bell and industrial segments the net revenue decrease included the following factors 

  

·   lower cessna revenues of 327 million primarily due to lower citation jet volume of 384 million and citationair volume of 114 million partially offset by higher aftermarket volume of 65 million and higher preowned aircraft volume of 53 million 

·   lower finance revenues of 83 million primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact of 46 million from lower average finance receivables and a decrease of 25 million in revenues related to the resolution of a timeshare account in 2012 

·   lower textron systems revenues of 72 million largely due to lower volume of 51 million in the marine  land product line and lower volume of 28 million in the uas product line 

·   higher bell revenues of 237 million largely due to higher volume of 163 million in our military programs primarily reflecting higher v22 deliveries and aftermarket volume and 74 million of higher commercial revenues largely due to higher aircraft volume 

·   higher industrial segment revenues of 112 million primarily due to higher volume of 58 million and the impact of acquisitions of 46 million 

  

revenues increased 962 million 9 in 2012 compared with 2011 as increases in the bell cessna industrial and finance segments were partially offset by a reduction in the textron systems segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

·   higher bell revenues of 749 million primarily due to higher commercial aircraft volume of 476 million and an increase in v22 program volume of 231 million largely due to higher deliveries 

·   higher cessna revenues of 121 million primarily due to higher preowned aircraft volume of 68 million and citation jet revenues of 57 million reflecting a change in mix of jets sold during the period 

·   increased industrial segment revenues of 115 million primarily due to higher volume of 171 million primarily reflecting higher market demand in the fuel systems and functional components and golf turf care and light 

  

  

transportation vehicles product lines partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 80 million primarily related to the weakening of the euro 

·   higher finance revenues of 112 million as described more fully in the segment analysis below 

·   lower textron systems revenues of 135 million primarily due to lower volume across all product lines 

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

   

manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses changes in operating expenses are more fully discussed in our segment analysis below 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was 846 in 2013 and 833 in both 2012 and 2011 

  

consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased 112 million 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher sales volume at bell and the impact from businesses acquired in 2013 partially offset by lower sales at cessna and textron systems in 2013 gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 130 basis points primarily due to unfavorable performance at bell largely due to manufacturing inefficiencies associated with labor disruptions resulting from negotiations with bargained employees and with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in the first quarter of 2013 as well as lower citation jet and citiationair volume at cessna 

  

selling and administrative expenses decreased 39 million 3 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to a reduction in administrative expenses of 26 million and lower provision for loan losses of 20 million at the finance segment both primarily associated with the noncaptive business selling and administrative expense was also impacted by 28 million in severance costs incurred in 2013 at cessna which were largely offset by a 27 million charge from an unfavorable arbitration award incurred in 2012 at cessna 

  

in 2012 consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased 711 million 8 compared with 2011 principally due to higher net sales volume cost of sales was reduced by 65 million in 2012 from foreign exchange fluctuations primarily in the industrial segment due to the weakening of the euro in addition cost of sales included 37 million in charges related to our new uas feeforservice contracts at textron systems which were offset by the impact of 2011 charges at textron systems of 60 million related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs selling and administrative expense decreased 30 million 3 in 2012 compared with 2011 the decrease was largely driven by lower operating expenses of 56 million at the finance segment primarily associated with the exit of the noncaptive business partially offset by a 27 million charge at cessna from an unfavorable arbitration award described more fully in the segment analysis below 

  

interest expense 

   

interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest 

  

consolidated interest expense decreased 39 million 18 in 2013 compared with 2012 and 34 million 14 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding 

  

valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining golf mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future and accordingly transferred 458 million of the remaining golf mortgage finance receivables net of an 80 million allowance for loan losses from the held for investment classification to the held for sale 

  

  

classification these finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer resulting in a 186 million charge recorded to valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

  

other losses net 

in 2011 other losses net included 55 million in losses on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes which was largely offset by a 52 million gain from the collection on notes receivable in connection with the disposition of the fluid  power business in 2008 

  

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 261 in 2013 309 in 2012 and 281 in 2011 and generally differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 due to certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world as well as research credits the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented include primarily canada germany belgium and china we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the us our effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our us and nonus operations in addition the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted on january 2 2013 to retroactively reinstate and extend the federal research and development tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result our income tax provision for 2013 includes a tax benefit that reduced the annual effective tax rate by approximately four percent we estimate our full year annual effective tax rate in 2014 to be approximately 315 for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

segment analysis 

  

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments cessna bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense and certain corporate expenses the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest expense 

  

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenue represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

  

approximately 30 of our 2013 revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes 

  

cessna 

   

  

cessna revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2013 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

   

in 2013 cessna’s revenues decreased 327 million 11 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower citation jet volume of 384 million and lower citationair volume of 114 million largely related to the winddown of our fractional share business these decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket volume of 65 million largely due to increased service demand and higher preowned aircraft volume of 53 million we delivered 139 citation jets in 2013 compared with 181 jets in 2012 during 2013 the portion of cessna’s revenues derived from aftermarket sales and services increased to 33 of cessna’s revenues compared with 25 in the corresponding period of 2012 due to higher aftermarket volume and the impact of lower citation jet revenues 

  

cessna’s operating expenses decreased 197 million 7 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower sales volume as discussed above the volumerelated decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by 37 million of operating costs incurred by service centers acquired at the beginning of 2013 and 33 million of inflation largely due to higher pension expense of 17 million

cessna’s operating expenses increased by 99 million 3 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the following 

  

·   93 million in higher direct material costs resulting from increased preowned aircraft sales volume and a change in the mix of jets sold during the period 

·   35 million in cost inflation largely reflecting a 22 million favorable benefit recorded in 2011 related to the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for inventories 

·   27 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to an unfavorable award an arbitration panel entered against cessna as a result of an alleged breach of a supply agreement 

  

these increases were partially offset by 33 million of cost reductions from improved factory efficiency and 24 million in lower engineering and development expenses

revenues at textron systems decreased 135 million 7 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower volume in the marine  land product line of 76 million lower volume in the mission support and other product line of 45 million and lower volume in weapons and sensors of 13 million 

  

textron systems’ operating expenses decreased 126 million 7 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the lower volume operating expenses for 2012 included 37 million in charges discussed below related to the uas feeforservice program which were offset by the impact of charges at textron systems of 60 million during 2011 related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs 

  

uas feeforservice program 

in 2012 we were awarded two indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts with separate us government customers for uas feeforservice activities in the third quarter of 2012 we experienced startup issues as we began deployment for the first of these contracts the meuas ii program which required us to augment training procedures add resources and adjust certain estimated costs at that time we took an 18 million charge reflecting our estimated loss on the awarded task orders under both contracts based on our deployment experience which resulted in changes to certain assumptions and also reflected higher subcontractor upfront training and program management costs to support the rampup in the fourth quarter of 2012 we experienced propulsion performance issues with our systems and as a result we were not able to perform within our previous cost estimates based on the issues we have encountered we increased our estimate of the cost to complete the awarded task orders under both contracts through completion of those orders and recorded a 19 million unfavorable program profit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2012 

  

in 2013 we recorded 15 million of charges for the uas feefor service program related to our estimate of costs to fulfill options that were exercised by the customer during the third quarter these options extended the period of performance on the initial task orders under the contracts for one year we continued to experience unacceptable quality from our engine supplier for this program and decided in the third quarter to transition the manufacture of the engine to our lycoming business we believe this change will allow us to improve performance

finance 

   

finance revenues 

finance segment revenues decreased 83 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact of 46 million attributable to lower average finance receivables of 834 million revenues during 2013 were also lower by 25 million due to the resolution of a timeshare account that returned to accrual status in 2012 

  

finance segment revenues increased 112 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

·   90 million increase related to the valuation of golf mortgage finance receivables held for sale in 2012 we had 76 million in favorable valuation adjustments compared with unfavorable valuation adjustments of 14 million in 2011

finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables that are classified as held for investment 

   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation tfc and its consolidated subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs based on our existing cash balances the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives as appropriate 

  

on october 4 2013 textron entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of which up to 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit this facility expires in october 2018 at december 28 2013 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 35 million of letters of credits issued against it 

  

we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities on january 30 2014 we issued 250 million in 365 notes due 2021 and 350 million in 430 notes due 2024 under this registration statement we plan to use the net proceeds of the issuance of these notes to finance a portion of the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in beech holdings llc the parent of beechcraft corporation which we have agreed to purchase for approximately 14 billion in cash the transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2014 subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals if the transaction is not completed or the related merger agreement is terminated on or before december 31 2014 we will be required to redeem all outstanding 2021 notes at a redemption price equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

on january 24 2014 in order to finance the beechcraft acquisition we also entered into a fiveyear term loan with a syndicate of banks in the principal amount of 500 million which we intend to draw down upon the closing of the transaction 

  

  

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

   

we generated 658 million in cash from operating activities in 2013 on 914 million in manufacturing group segment profit and 470 million of net income the 300 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2012 was largely due to a 429 million impact related to working capital requirements and 64 million in lower income from continuing operations which were partially offset by 211 million in lower contributions to our pension plans in 2013 the most significant change within working capital was a 230 million unfavorable impact resulting from net tax payments of 223 million in 2013 compared to net tax refunds of 7 million in 2012 in addition we had 165 million in cash inflows related to changes in inventory levels largely at cessna which was more than offset by 264 million of cash outflows from changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable the change in inventory levels at cessna was primarily related to lower preowned inventory partially offset by higher inventory in support of new sales 

  

in 2012 we generated 958 million in cash from operating activities on 11 billion in manufacturing group segment profit and 534 million of manufacturing group net income the 26 increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2011 was largely due to lower cash contributions of 237 million made to our pension plans in 2012 within working capital we had a 117 million reduction in cash resulting from an increase in preowned inventory in at cessna primarily due to higher tradein activities which was largely offset by a reduction in net taxes paid 

  

pension contributions were 194 million 405 million and 642 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

investing cash flows in 2013 2012 and 2011 primarily included capital expenditures of 444 million 480 million and 423 million respectively cash flows from investing activities also included 196 million of cash used in 2013 for acquisitions of four businesses within our textron systems and industrial segments and two service centers in our cessna segment 

  

in 2013 financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of 528 million of outstanding debt including the settlement of our convertible notes which was partially offset by proceeds from a 150 million variablerate term loan agreement in 2012 we generated cash from financing activities largely due to the receipt of 490 million from the finance group in payment of its intergroup borrowing partially offset by 272 million in share repurchases and 189 million in payments on our outstanding debt in 2011 financing activities primarily consisted of 580 million in payments related to the purchase and cancellation of convertible notes and 175 million in intergroup financing for our finance group partially offset by 496 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes 

  

dividends 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 22 million 17 million and 22 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

share repurchases 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 under a 2007 share repurchase authorization we repurchased 111 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 272 million which fully utilized our available repurchase authorization on january 23 2013 our board of directors approved a new authorization program for 25 million shares under which we intend to purchase shares of common stock to offset the impact of dilution from sharebased compensation plans beginning in 2014 and for opportunistic capital management purposes 

  

on february 5 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr with a counterparty to repurchase an aggregate of 43 million shares of our outstanding common stock from the counterparty for 150 million the asr is scheduled to expire in december 2014 upon final settlement of the asr we may receive additional shares or pay additional cash or shares at our option based on the daily volume weighted average market price of our common stock over the course of a calculation period less a discount 

  

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron and tfc textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated 

  

  

shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million cash contributions paid to tfc to maintain compliance with the support agreement and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 

   

during 2013 we also made a 1 million capital contribution to tfc to fund the repurchase of a portion of tfc’s 6 fixedtofloating rate junior subordinated notes 

  

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statements of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

  

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

   

in 2013 and 2012 the finance group’s cash flows from operating activities were primarily impacted by changes in net taxes receivedpaid and the impact of earnings net tax refundspayments were 49 million 43 million and 65 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively net tax payments in 2012 included a settlement related to the internal revenue service’s challenge of tax deductions claimed in prior years for certain leveraged lease transactions 

  

cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables and proceeds from sales of finance receivables and other finance assets totaling 853 million in 2013 13 billion in 2012 and 19 billion in 2011 partially offset by financial receivable originations of 271 million in 2013 331 million in 2012 and 471 million in 2011 

  

cash used in financing activities included principal payments on longterm debt of 743 million 426 million and 756 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from long term debt of 298 million 106 million and 430 million respectively in 2012 the finance group also made cash payments totaling 493 million to the manufacturing group related to intergroup borrowings in 2011 the finance group paid 14 billion against the outstanding balance on its bank line of credit 

  

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

   

  

cash flows from operating activities decreased 122 million during 2013 as compared with 2012 largely due to a 133 million impact related to working capital requirements and lower earnings which were partially offset by a 206 million impact of lower contributions to our pension plans in 2013 significant changes within working capital included a 138 million unfavorable impact resulting from net taxes paid between the periods as net tax payments were 174 million and 36 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and 264 million of cash outflows related to changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable these cash outflows were partially offset by 198 million of cash inflows related to changes in inventory levels largely at cessna and a 141 million impact from lower captive finance receivables 

  

cash flows from operating activities decreased during 2012 as compared with 2011 as higher earnings were offset by changes in working capital which included lower net cash receipts from our captive financing activities of 140 million and an increase in preowned inventory in the cessna segment largely due to higher tradein activities resulting in a cash reduction of 117 million our use of cash for working capital requirements was partially offset by 237 million in lower cash pension contributions made in 2012 

  

cash flows from investing activities included capital expenditures of 444 million 480 million and 423 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively collections on finance receivables and proceeds from sales of finance receivables and other finance assets totaled 368 million in 2013 848 million in 2012 and 14 billion in 2011 cash flows from investing activities also included 196 million of cash used in 2013 for acquisitions of four businesses within our textron systems and industrial segments and two service centers in our cessna segment 

  

financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of outstanding longterm debt of 13 billion 06 billion and 14 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 448 million 106 million and 926 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively cash used in financing activities also included 272 million of share repurchases in 2012 and repayments of 14 billion against the outstanding balance on our bank credit lines in 2011 

  

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

   

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 28 2013 

  

   

1   we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2014 we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately 33 million and approximately 19 million in the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2015 through 2018 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 75 million to 130 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

2   other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2013 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability warranty and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

3   operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 

  

4   purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 40 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of december 28 2013 

  

   

1   securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 

  

2   interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt they do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt 

  

at december 28 2013 the finance group also had 93 million in other liabilities primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended december 28 2013 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using discounted cash flows these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

based on our annual impairment review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2013 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 756 compared with 758 in 2012 in 2013 and 2012 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 775 a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2013 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 25 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2013 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 423 compared with 494 in 2012 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 425 in 2013 compared with 500 for 2012 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2013 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 31 million 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2013 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2013 medical rate of 720 is assumed to decrease to 500 by 2021 and then remain at that level the 2013 prescription drug rate of 720 is assumed to decrease to 500 by 2021 and then remain at that level see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

warranty liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

  

finance receivables 

finance receivables are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management’s evaluation for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios a reserve is established based on comparing the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the finance receivable is collateral dependent to its carrying amount the expected future cash flows consider collateral value financial performance and liquidity of our borrower existence and financial strength of guarantors estimated recovery costs including legal expenses and costs associated with the repossession and eventual disposal of collateral when there is a range of potential outcomes we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the potential outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence the evaluation of our portfolio is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral which may differ from actual results while our analysis is specific to each individual account critical factors included in this analysis include industry valuation guides age and physical condition of the collateral payment history and existence and financial strength of guarantors 

  

we also establish an allowance for losses to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio this allowance is established as a percentage of nonrecourse finance receivables which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience current delinquency and default trends collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends 

  

  

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 636 million and 664 million at the end of 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for 2013 and 2012 from the prior year for each period is provided below 

  

   

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities that includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 

  

  

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts 

  

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar 

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

finance segment 

our finance segment or the finance group is a commercial finance business that consists of textron financial corporation tfc and its consolidated subsidiaries along with three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc in the fourth quarter of 2008 we announced a plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture the noncaptive portion of this business is based primarily in north america and includes the following product lines golf mortgage timeshare and structured capital the exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales during 2012 we reduced our total finance receivable portfolio by 821 million primarily through liquidations we expect to liquidate the majority of the remaining 370 million in the noncaptive portfolio over the next two years 

  

our finance segment continues to originate new customer relationships and finance receivables in the captive finance business which provides financing primarily for new cessna aircraft and bell helicopters and to a limited extent for new ezgo and jacobsen equipment we also provide financing to purchasers of preowned cessna aircraft and bell helicopters on a limited basis the majority of new finance receivables are crossborder transactions for aircraft sold outside of the united states new originations in the us are primarily for purchasers who had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing for the purchase of textronmanufactured products

backlog 

our backlog at the end of 2012 and 2011 is summarized below 

  

   

approximately 56 of our total backlog at december 29 2012 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2013 orders from cessna customers which cover a wide spectrum of industries and individuals worldwide are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive purchase agreement and the initial customer deposit is received we work with our customers to provide estimated delivery dates which may be adjusted based on customer needs or our production schedule but do not establish definitive delivery dates until approximately six months before expected delivery there is considerable uncertainty as to when or whether backlog will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability these factors also may be impacted by the economy and public perceptions of private corporate jet usage while backlog is an indicator of future revenues we cannot reasonably estimate the year each order in backlog ultimately will result in revenues and cash flows orders remain in backlog until the aircraft is delivered or upon cancellation by the customer upon cancellation deposits are used to defray costs including remarketing fees cost to reconfigure the aircraft and other costs incurred as a result of the cancellation remaining deposits if any may be retained or refunded at our discretion 

  

backlog with the us government in the above table includes only funded amounts as the us government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract bell’s backlog includes 31 billion related to a multiyear procurement contract with the us government for the purchase of v22 tiltrotor aircraft

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2012 we derived approximately 29 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we are more at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for us government programs in which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

mounting pressure for us government deficit reduction and reduced national spending have created an environment where national security spending is being closely examined in august 2011 congress passed the budget control act of 2011 which committed the us government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years under this act very substantial automatic spending cuts known as “sequestration” including approximately 600 billion in cuts to the us defense budget over a nine year period are scheduled to be triggered beginning in 2013 in addition the nation’s debt ceiling is currently expected to be reached during the first half of 2013 congress and the administration continue to debate how the nation should proceed on these issues the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs 

  

there are many variables in how the sequester could be implemented that make it difficult to determine specific impacts however we expect that sequestration as currently provided for under the budget control act would result in lower revenues profits and cash flows for our company such circumstances may also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets because our government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the us government is unable to make timely payments if the debt ceiling is not raised and as a result the us government does not pay us on a timely basis we would need to finance our continued performance of the impacted contracts from our available cash resources credit facilities andor access to the capital markets if available an extended delay in the timely payment by the us government could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows earnings and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability including but not limited to liability for reprocurement costs in excess 

  

  

of the total original contract amount net of the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts we also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the us government where we retain ownership of and consequently the risk of loss on aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts termination of these contracts for convenience or default could materially and adversely impact our results of operations on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition us government contracts generally require the contractor to continue to perform on a contract even if the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations as well as changes in the department of defense dod acquisition practices 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely disclose may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

  

in 2010 the dod issued guidance to its acquisition workforce to obtain greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending through an initiative known as the “better buying power initiative” the dod has announced that an updated initiative to be known as “better buying power 20” will be launched in early 2013 these efforts may significantly affect the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers and could have a significant impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and if so how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so 

  

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors the systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting estimating material management and accounting earned value management purchasing and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

  

weak demand for our aircraft products may continue to adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of the continued worldwide economic softness we have experienced continued weak demand for our fixedwing aircraft particularly our business jets soft demand for new and preowned jets could persist and could continue to adversely impact the pricing of new jets and the valuation of preowned jets we have accepted a higher proportion of tradeins of preowned jets in order to sell new jets and we are winding down our fractional business jet ownership business these two factors have increased our inventory of preowned jets 

  

concerns regarding the financial stability of certain eurozone countries the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency may have an adverse impact on financial institutions and capital markets in europe and globally which could impede the ability of our customers to obtain financing to purchase our jets and helicopters and further reduce demand for our products in addition both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels that may adversely impact demand for jets andor helicopters a prolonged weakness in the markets for our commercial aircraft products could adversely impact our results of operations and our future prospects 

  

difficult economic conditions could continue to affect the performance of our finance segment and our losses may increase if we are unable to successfully collect our finance receivables or realize sufficient value from collateral 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral value geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions on our customers’ businesses the performance of our liquidating noncaptive finance receivable portfolios may be adversely affected by other variables including changes in our liquidation strategy and changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our assets valuations of the types of collateral securing our captive finance portfolio particularly valuations of preowned aircraft have decreased over the past several years and may continue to decrease if weak economic conditions continue declining collateral values could result in greater delinquencies credit losses and foreclosures if customers elect to discontinue payments on loan balances that exceed asset values or in the case of assets in our liquidating portfolios if they are unable to obtain alternative sources of financing at loan maturity bankruptcy proceedings involving our borrowers may prevent or delay our ability to exercise our rights and remedies and realize the full value of our collateral significant delay or difficulty in executing the continued liquidation of our liquidating portfolios andor substantial losses in any of our finance asset portfolios could negatively impact the ability of our finance segment to generate the cash necessary to service its debt resulting in adverse effects on our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

  

we may need to obtain financing in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due andor to support our operations although we currently have access to the capital markets our access and the cost of borrowings is affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

our ability to fund our captive financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets 

our finance segment’s ability to continue to offer customer financing for the products that we manufacture and the longterm viability and profitability of the captive finance business is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding and at a reasonable cost both of which are dependent on a number of factors including market conditions and our credit ratings if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing or if we are unable to offer competitive customer financing it could negatively impact our manufacturing group’s ability to generate sales which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations 

  

our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material 

  

  

product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology security threats and other disruptions 

as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information and threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees as do our customers suppliers subcontractors and joint venture partners our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations cybersecurity threats such as malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to information and other security breaches are persistent continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources an information technology system failure or breach of data security could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or the compromise of confidential information and require significant management attention and resources the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and our results of operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global information technology infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements in our current and future markets and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed changes in environmental laws and regulations for example those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through our research and development efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the market for our product offerings may not develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

our international business including us exports exposes us to potentially greater risks than our domestic business our exposure to such risks increases as our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices which may change from time to time including regulations relating to importexport control environmental health and safety investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks these international risks may be especially significant with respect to aerospace and defense products for which we sometimes first must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside the us any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside the us could negatively impact our results of operations additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts 

  

  

generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements which could adversely impact our results of operations additionally we are facing increasing competition in our international markets from foreign and multinational firms that may have certain home country advantages over us as a result our ability to compete successfully in those markets may be adversely affected which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

  

we maintain manufacturing facilities service centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require capital investment guaranties or other commitments we expect that our investment in emerging market countries will continue to increase emerging market operations can present many risks in addition to those discussed above including civil disturbances economic and government instability terrorism and related safety concerns cultural differences in employment and business practices difficulties in protecting intellectual property and the imposition of exchange controls the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives consultants joint ventures business partners subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example we could be affected by us or foreign laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns likewise pursuant to the requirements of the doddfrank act and recently enacted securities and exchange commission rules we will be required to report on our use of “conflict minerals” originating from the democratic republic of congo and surrounding countries compliance with these rules is expected to be timeconsuming and costly and also could affect the cost and availability of minerals used to manufacture certain of our products compliance with new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations and limit our ability to sell our products and services compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and debarment as a government contractor these improper actions could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our 

  

  

business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cyber threats 

  

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans are recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the year in which they occur also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

  

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate would increase the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits moreover we expect that some of the requirements of the new comprehensive healthcare law will increase our future costs increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 6400 of our us employees or 26 of our total us employees are unionized and approximately 2800 of our nonus employees or 33 of our total nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace in addition the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates in particular the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

an analysis of our consolidated operating results is provided below and a more detailed analysis of our segments’ operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 to 30 

  

revenues 

revenues increased 962 million 9 in 2012 compared with 2011 as increases in the bell cessna industrial and finance segments were partially offset by a reduction in the textron systems segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

   

revenues increased 750 million 7 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an 8 increase in manufacturing revenues with increases in the cessna bell and industrial segments that were partially offset by lower revenues in the textron systems segment the net revenue increase included the following factors 

  

   

  

cost of sales and selling and administrative expense 

  

   

manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses changes in operating expenses are more fully discussed in our segment analysis below 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was 833 in both 2012 and 2011 and 835 in 2010 

  

consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased 711 million 8 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to higher net sales volume cost of sales was reduced by 65 million in 2012 from foreign exchange fluctuations primarily in the industrial segment due to the weakening of the euro in addition cost of sales included 37 million in charges related to our new uas feeforservice contracts at textron systems which were offset by the impact of 2011 charges at textron systems of 60 million related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs selling and administrative expense decreased 15 million 1 to 1168 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the decrease was largely driven by lower operating expenses of 56 million at the finance segment primarily associated with the exit of the noncaptive business partially offset by a 27 million charge at cessna from an unfavorable arbitration award described more fully in the segment analysis below 

  

consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased 703 million 8 in 2011 compared with 2010 principally due to higher sales volume in the cessna bell and industrial segments in 2011 gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to favorable product mix and improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume at cessna and bell these improvements were partially offset by a 64 million increase in engineering and development expenses throughout our manufacturing businesses and 60 million in charges at textron systems related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and severance costs in 2011 selling and administrative expense decreased 48 million 4 to 12 billion compared with 2010 primarily due to 44 million in lower operating expense at the finance segment largely reflecting progress towards our exit from the noncaptive commercial finance business and a 23 million decrease in corporate expense primarily due to the impact of changes in our stock price on compensation expense these decreases were partially offset by higher bid and proposal costs at textron systems in 2011 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest 

  

consolidated interest expense decreased 34 million 14 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in 2011 consolidated interest expense decreased 24 million 9 compared with 2010 primarily due to a decrease in the finance group largely due to the reduction in its debt from liquidations in the noncaptive portfolio 

  

valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining golf mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future and accordingly transferred 458 million of the remaining golf mortgage finance receivables net of an 80 million allowance for loan losses from the held for investment classification to the held for sale classification these finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer resulting in a 186 million charge recorded to valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

  

  

special charges 

there were no amounts recorded within special charges in 2012 and 2011 in 2010 special charges included restructuring charges totaling 99 million including 76 million of severance costs these charges were related to a global restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and included the announcement of the exit of portions of our commercial finance business this restructuring program was substantially completed at the end of 2011 in 2010 special charges also included a 91 million noncash pretax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the statement of operations as a result of substantially liquidating a canadian finance entity 

  

other losses net 

in 2011 other losses net included 55 million in losses on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes which was largely offset by a 52 million gain from the collection on notes receivable in connection with the disposition of the fluid  power business in 2008 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income tax expense benefit 

our effective rate was 309 in 2012 281 in 2011 and 64 in 2010 and generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective rate impact in the periods presented include primarily canada belgium and china we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the united states our effective rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our us and foreign operations for a full reconciliation of our effective rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

subsequent to year end the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted on january 2 2013 to retroactively reinstate and extend the federal research and development tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result our income tax provision in the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit that will reduce the annual effective tax rate by approximately one percent

·   lower weapons and sensors volume of 13 million primarily due to the completion of several contracts in 2011 partially offset by higher international sensor fuzed weapon volume of 67 million 

  

textron systems’ operating expenses decreased 126 million 7 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the lower volume operating expenses for 2012 included 37 million in charges discussed below related to our new uas feeforservice contracts which were offset by the impact of charges at textron systems of 60 million during 2011 related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs 

  

in 2012 we were awarded two indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts with separate us government customers for uas feeforservice activities in the third quarter of 2012 we experienced startup issues as we began deployment for the first of these contracts the meuas ii program which required us to augment training procedures add resources and adjust certain estimated costs at that time we took an 18 million charge reflecting our estimated loss on the awarded task orders under both contracts based on our deployment experience which resulted in changes to certain assumptions and also reflected higher subcontractor upfront training and program management costs to support the rampup in the fourth quarter of 2012 we experienced propulsion performance issues with our systems and as a result we were not able to perform within our previous cost estimates based on the issues we have encountered we increased our estimate of the costs to complete the awarded task orders under both contracts through completion of those orders and recorded a 19 million unfavorable program profit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2012 our current financial guidance and backlog do not reflect additional task orders under the meuas ii idiq contract after the current active orders conclude in april 2013 

  

factors contributing to the 2011 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

revenues at textron systems decreased 107 million 5 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower volume reflecting the following changes 

  

·   lower uas volume of 84 million largely due to lower deliveries and to the timing of revenues from various programs 

·   lower mission support and other product line volume of 56 million largely due to the completion of several test and training programs and lower intelligence systems volume 

·   higher land  marine volume of 18 million primarily related to armored security vehicles 

·   higher weapons and sensors revenues of 10 million largely due to higher sensor fuzed weapon volume 

  

textron systems’ operating expenses decreased 18 million 1 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the lower volume which was partially offset by the 41 million intangible asset impairment charge and 19 million primarily in severance costs related to the workforce reduction taken in 2011 

  

  

textron systems segment profit 

factors contributing to 2012 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 

  

   

segment profit at textron systems decreased 9 million 6 in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting the impact of lower volume described above and deliveries on lower margin contracts during the current period the favorable performance reflects a charge in 2011 of 19 million primarily in severance costs related to workforce reductions 9 million in lower amortization expense on intangible assets and 8 million in lower net research and development costs partially offset by the 37 million in charges related to the uas feeforservice contracts described above 

  

factors contributing to 2011 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 

  

   

segment profit at textron systems decreased 89 million 39 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the impact of lower volume described above and mix along with the 41 million intangible asset impairment charge and approximately 19 million in severance costs related to the workforce reduction included in the other line 

  

textron systems backlog 

in 2012 textron systems backlog increased 16 billion 118 largely due to additional orders in the uas and land  marine product lines including the canadian tapv contract for 693 million received in the second quarter of 2012 in 2011 textron systems backlog decreased 261 million reflecting deliveries in excess of new orders related to various military programs 

  

industrial 

  

   

industrial revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2012 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

  

industrial segment revenues increased 115 million 4 in 2012 compared with 2011 higher volume resulted from a 93 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components product line reflecting higher automotive industry demand in north america and a 78 million increase in the other industrial product lines largely related to higher market demand in the golf turf care and light transportation vehicles product line the unfavorable foreign exchange impact was mostly related to the weakening of the euro which primarily impacted the fuel systems and functional components product line 

  

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 102 million 4 in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to 130 million in higher direct material costs in support of higher sales volume in 2012 operating expenses were also impacted by cost inflation of 44 million primarily due to higher material and overhead costs partially offset by lower costs due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of 70 million resulting from the weakening of the euro 

  

factors contributing to the 2011 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

  

   

industrial segment revenues increased 261 million 10 in 2011 from 2010 volume increased and mix improved largely due to a 117 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components product line reflecting higher automotive industry demand and 21 million in the other industrial product lines largely related to the powered tools testing and measurement equipment product line reflecting higher sales in north america and europe the favorable foreign exchange impact was primarily related to strengthening of the euro which mostly impacted the fuel systems and functional components product line higher other industrial revenues of 78 million included a 27 million impact from acquisitions and improved pricing of 20 million in addition to the higher volume 

  

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 221 million 9 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a 115 million increase in direct material costs due to higher sales volume a 68 million impact from foreign exchange related to strengthening of the euro and 40 million in inflation for direct materials related to various commodity and material components throughout the segment 

  

industrial segment profit 

factors contributing to 2012 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 

  

   

segment profit for the industrial segment increased 13 million 6 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the impact from higher volume as described above partially offset by cost inflation that exceeded related price increases 

  

factors contributing to 2011 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 

  

   

  

industrial segment profit increased 40 million 25 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a 34 million impact from improved performance and a 31 million impact from higher volume as described above partially offset by inflation net of pricing of 35 million performance was favorable for the period due to continued cost reduction activities and improved manufacturing leverage resulting from higher volume inflation net of pricing was primarily due to higher direct material costs for commodity and material components that exceeded related price increases principally in the fuel systems and functional components product line 

  

finance 

   

our plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business of our finance segment has been effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales we expect to liquidate the majority of the remaining 370 million of finance receivables in the noncaptive portfolio over the next two years 

  

finance revenues 

finance segment revenues increased 112 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

finance segment revenues decreased 115 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily attributable to the impact of a 18 billion lower average finance receivable balance 

  

finance segment profit loss 

finance segment profit increased 397 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to changes in valuation adjustments lower portfolio losses net of gains and the resolution of one significant timeshare account discussed above as well as lower administrative expense of 56 million primarily associated with the exit of the noncaptive business in addition we recorded a 186 million valuation allowance on the transfer of the golf mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification during the fourth quarter of 2011 these increases were partially offset by a 27 million decrease in net interest margin attributable to lower average finance receivables 

  

finance segment loss increased 96 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the 186 million valuation allowance recorded on the transfer of the remaining golf mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification during the fourth quarter of 2011 and a 61 million reduction in interest margin resulting from the lower average finance receivable balance these increases were partially offset by 131 million in lower provision for loan losses primarily the result of a decline in new troubled accounts in the noncaptive portfolio during 2011 and a 36 million reversal of the allowance for losses related to one significant account in addition administrative expense declined by 44 million primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with a workforce reduction and other cost reductions related to the exit of the noncaptive business 

  

  

finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment 

  

   

finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics above finance receivables held for sale in the noncaptive portfolio totaled 140 million at the end of 2012 compared with 418 million at the end of 2011 

  

nonaccrual finance receivables decreased 178 million 55 from 2011 primarily due to reductions of 129 million in the timeshare portfolio and 38 million in the captive portfolio the decrease in the timeshare portfolio was primarily due to the liquidation of one significant account the captive portfolio decreased mostly due to repossession of collateral and cash collections partially offset by new accounts identified as nonaccrual in 2012 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of tfc its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

  

   

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that with our existing cash and equivalents along with the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 

  

  

textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion up to 200 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit at december 29 2012 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 37 million of letters of credits issued against it we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities 

  

at december 29 2012 the principal amount of our convertible notes outstanding was 215 million under the terms of the indenture that governs the notes the notes are currently convertible at the holder’s option through april 29 2013 the second trading day preceding their may 1 2013 maturity date we may deliver shares of common stock cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash 

  

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

we generated 958 million in cash from operating activities in 2012 on 11 billion in manufacturing group segment profit and 534 million of manufacturing group net income the 26 increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2011 was largely due to lower cash contributions made to our pension plans in 2012 within working capital we had a 117 million reduction in cash resulting from an increase in preowned inventory in the cessna segment primarily due to higher tradein activities which was largely offset by a reduction in net taxes paid we made pension contributions of 405 million 642 million and 417 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively cash flows from operating activities increased in 2011 compared with 2010 largely due to higher earnings for the manufacturing group partially offset by higher cash pension contributions 

  

investing cash flows in 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily included capital expenditures of 480 million 423 million and 270 million respectively in support of our new product development and cost improvement strategies 

  

we generated cash from financing activities in 2012 largely due to the receipt of 490 million from the finance group in payment of its intergroup borrowing partially offset by share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 189 million in payments on our outstanding debt in 2011 financing activities primarily consisted of 580 million in payments related to the purchase and cancellation of convertible notes and 175 million in intergroup financing for our finance group partially offset by 496 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes in 2010 we repaid 12 billion of our bank credit lines 

  

share repurchases 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 under a 2007 share repurchase authorization we repurchased 111 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 272 million which fully utilized our available repurchase authorization on january 22 2013 our board of directors approved a new authorization program for 25 million shares under which we intend to purchase shares of common stock to offset the impact of dilution from sharebased compensation plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes 

  

dividends 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 17 million 22 million and 22 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc textron inc is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million cash contributions paid to tfc to maintain compliance with the support agreement and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 

  

   

  

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

  

finance group cash flows 

during 2012 we liquidated 821 million of the finance group’s finance receivables net of originations these finance receivable reductions occurred in both the noncaptive and captive finance portfolios but were primarily driven by the noncaptive portfolio in connection with our exit plan including 241 million and 218 million in the golf mortgage and timeshare product lines respectively depending on market conditions we expect to liquidate the majority of the remaining 370 million of finance receivables in the noncaptive portfolio over the next two years 

  

  

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities decreased in 2012 primarily due to changes in taxes paidreceived partially offset by higher earnings net tax paymentsrefunds were 43 million 65 million and 101 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively net tax payments in 2012 and 2010 included settlements related to the irs’s challenge of tax deductions claimed in prior years for certain leveraged lease transactions 

  

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales totaled 11 billion in 2012 18 billion in 2011 and 30 billion in 2010 cash outflows for originations declined to 331 million in 2012 from 471 million in 2011 and 866 million in 2010 these decreases were largely driven by the wind down of the noncaptive business 

  

cash used in financing activities included principal payments on longterm debt of 04 billion 08 billion and 21 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of 106 million 430 million and 231 million respectively in 2012 the finance group also made cash payments totaling 493 million to the manufacturing group related to intergroup borrowings in 2011 and 2010 the finance group paid 14 billion and 03 billion respectively against the outstanding balance on its bank line of credit 

  

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities decreased during 2012 as compared with 2011 as higher earnings were offset by changes in working capital which included lower net cash receipts from our captive financing activities of 140 million and an increase in preowned inventory in the cessna segment largely due to higher tradein activities resulting in a cash reduction of 117 million our use of cash for working capital requirements was partially offset by 237 million in lower cash pension contributions made in 2012 

  

cash flow from operating activities increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings for the manufacturing group partially offset by higher cash pension contributions made in 2011 in addition cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to 44 million in 2011 from 72 million in 2010 

  

  

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales totaled 07 billion in 2012 12 billion in 2011 and 22 billion in 2010 cash outflows for originations declined to 22 million in 2012 from 187 million in 2011 and 450 million in 2010 these decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the noncaptive business investing activities also included capital expenditures of 480 million 423 million and 270 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in support of our new product development and cost improvement strategies 

  

cash used in financing activities included principal payments on longterm debt of 06 billion 08 billion and 22 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2011 and 2010 financing activities also included repayments of 14 billion and 15 billion respectively against the outstanding balance on our bank credit lines cash used in financing activities also included 272 million of share repurchases in 2012 and 580 million in payments related to the purchase of convertible notes in 2011 these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of 106 million 926 million and 231 million respectively 

  

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 29 2012 

  

   

1   we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2013 we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately 160 million and approximately 22 million in the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2014 through 2017 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 100 million to 200 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

  

2   other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

3   operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 

  

4   purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price quantity and delivery dates approximately 40 of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

  

  

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of december 29 2012 

  

   

1   securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 

  

2   interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt they do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt 

  

at december 29 2012 the finance group also had 75 million in other liabilities primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs product performance performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries technical requirements or schedule 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

  

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended december 29 2012 

  

   

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

  

for the bell reporting unit we performed a qualitative assessment based on economic industry and companyspecific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test based on the results of the qualitative assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that the unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount and the next step of the impairment analysis was not required for our other reporting units we performed the next step of the impairment analysis which required us to calculate fair value of each reporting unit 

  

fair values were established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporated assumptions for short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts these plans do not include any potential impact that sequestration budget cuts may have on our businesses that serve the us government the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

  

if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

based on our annual impairment reviews the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2012 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 758 compared with 784 in 2011 in 2012 and 2011 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 775 and 800 respectively a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2012 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 24 million 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2012 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 494 compared with 571 in 2011 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 500 in 2012 compared with 575 for 2011 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2012 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 27 million 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2012 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2012 medical rate of 840 is assumed to decrease to 500 by 2021 and then remain at that level the 2012 prescription drug rate of 840 is assumed to decrease to 500 by 2021 and then remain at that level see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

warranty liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

  

allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 

finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management’s evaluation for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value with either a the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate or b the fair value of the underlying collateral if the finance receivable is collateral dependent the expected future cash flows consider collateral value financial performance and liquidity of our borrower existence and financial strength of guarantors estimated recovery costs including legal expenses and costs associated with the repossessionforeclosure and eventual disposal of collateral when there is a range of potential outcomes we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence the evaluation of our portfolio is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral which may differ from actual results while our analysis is specific to each individual account critical factors included in this analysis for the captive product line include industry valuation guides age and physical condition of collateral payment history and existence and financial strength of guarantors 

  

  

we also establish an allowance for losses to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio for the captive product line the allowance is established as a percentage of nonrecourse finance receivables which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience current delinquency and default trends collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends 

  

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates for the captive business with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities which includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 

  

foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 07 billion and 06 billion at the end of 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for 2012 and 2011 from the prior year for each period is provided below 

  

   

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts 

  

  

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar 

  

  the value represents an asset or liability

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business 

we have customer concentration with the us government reduction in us government defense spending may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2011 we derived approximately 31 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract we are more at risk for nonreimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated 

mounting pressure for us government deficit reduction and reduced national spending have created an environment where national security spending is being closely examined in addition the withdrawal of us troops from iraq and uncertainty regarding the future level of us military involvement in afghanistan adds to the pressure to reduce defense spending in august 2011 congress passed the budget control act of 2011 which committed the us government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years under the budget act very substantial automatic spending cuts including approximately 600 billion in cuts to the us defense budget over a nine year period are scheduled to be triggered beginning in 2013 as a result longterm funding for various programs in which we participate as well as future purchasing decisions by our us government customers could be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the suppliers and subcontractors under our programs 

the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for us government programs in which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability including but not limited to liability for reprocurement costs and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government whether for convenience or default our backlog and anticipated revenues would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in addition us government contracts generally require the contractor to continue to perform on the contract even if the us government is unable to make timely payments failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default any such event could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

as a us government contractor we are subject to procurement rules and regulations as well as changes in the department of defense dod acquisition practices 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and 

  

associated materials a number of our us government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated us criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest or bribery the us civil false claims act or received a significant overpayment under a us government contract failure to properly and timely disclose may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines 

the dod has issued guidance to its acquisition workforce to obtain greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending by undertaking actions in five major areas known as the “better buying power initiative” target affordability and control cost growth incentivize productivity and innovation promote competition improve tradecraft in services acquisition and reduce nonproductive processes and bureaucracy this initiative is expected to significantly affect the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers and could have a significant impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and if so how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so 

as a us government contractor our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as dcaa and dcma these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting systems estimating systems material management and accounting systems earned value management systems purchasing systems and government property systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

weak demand for our aircraft products may continue to adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of the worldwide economic downturn over the past several years we have experienced weak demand for our new and used aircraft a tightening of credit availability for potential purchasers of our aircraft and a substantial number of cancellations of orders and customer requests for delayed delivery of ordered aircraft soft demand for new and preowned jets and helicopters could persist and could continue to adversely impact the pricing of new aircraft and the valuation of used aircraft concerns regarding the financial stability of certain eurozone countries the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency may have an adverse impact on financial institutions and capital markets in europe and globally which could impede the ability of our customers to obtain financing to purchase our aircraft and further reduce demand for our products in addition both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels that may adversely impact demand for jets andor helicopters a prolonged weakness in the markets for our commercial aircraft products could adversely impact our results of operations and our future prospects 

difficult economic conditions could continue to affect the performance of our finance segment and our credit losses may increase if we are unable to successfully collect our finance receivables or realize sufficient value from collateral 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of general economic conditions on our customers’ businesses the performance of our liquidating noncaptive finance receivable portfolios may be adversely affected by other variables including changes in our liquidation strategy the loss of personnel and changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our assets valuations of the types of collateral securing our golf mortgage portfolio which we are 

  

continuing to liquidate has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the market for golf courses in the us and general economic conditions valuations of the types of collateral securing our captive finance portfolio particularly valuations of used aircraft have decreased over the past several years and may continue to decrease if weak economic conditions continue declining collateral values could result in greater delinquencies credit losses and foreclosures if customers elect to discontinue payments on loan balances that exceed asset values or in the case of assets in our liquidating portfolios if they are unable to obtain alternative sources of financing at loan maturity bankruptcy proceedings involving our borrowers may prevent or delay our ability to exercise our rights and remedies and realize the full value of our collateral significant delay or difficulty in executing the continued liquidation of our liquidating portfolios andor substantial losses in any of our finance asset portfolios could negatively impact the ability of our finance segment to generate the cash necessary to service its debt including intercompany debt resulting in adverse effects on our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

we may need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due although we currently have access to the capital markets we may not be able to refinance our credit facilities or maturing debt at the time that such financing is necessary at terms that are acceptable to us or at all our ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain financing if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our ability to fund our captive financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets 

our finance segment’s ability to continue to offer customer financing for the products that we manufacture and the longterm viability and profitability of the captive finance business is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost this ability and cost in turn are dependent on our credit ratings and are subject to credit market volatility if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing or if we are unable to offer competitive customer financing it could negatively impact our manufacturing group’s ability to generate sales which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations 

our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in regulatory actions andor litigation 

our business could be negatively impacted by information technology security threats and other disruptions 

as a us defense contractor we face certain security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations an information technology system failure or breach of data security could disrupt our operations cause the loss of business information or the compromise of confidential information require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global information technology infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions also could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements in our current and future markets and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed changes in environmental laws and regulations for example those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through our research and development efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

our international business including us exports exposes us to certain unique and potentially greater risks than our domestic business our exposure to such risks increases as our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices which may change from time to time including regulations relating to importexport control environmental health and safety investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks these international risks may be especially significant with respect to aerospace and defense products for which we sometimes first must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside the us any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside the us could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows additionally we are facing increasing competition in our international markets from foreign and multinational firms that may have certain home country advantages over us as a result our ability to compete successfully in those markets may be adversely affected which could negatively impact our profitability 

we maintain manufacturing facilities services centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries we also have entered into and expect to continue to enter into joint venture arrangements in emerging market countries some of which may require guaranties or other commitments we expect that our investment in emerging market countries will continue to increase emerging market operations can present many risks in addition to those discussed above including civil disturbances economic and government instability terrorism and related safety concerns health concerns cultural differences in employment and business practices the imposition of exchange controls and risks associated with inadequate infrastructures to deal with natural disasters the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws any such violation by any of our international representatives consultants subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

  

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity for example we could be affected by us or foreign laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns likewise pursuant to the requirements of the doddfrank act we will be required to report on our use of “conflict minerals” originating from the democratic republic of congo and surrounding countries compliance with the proposed rules to implement this provision of the doddfrank act is expected to be timeconsuming and costly in addition these new requirements could affect the cost and availability of minerals used to manufacture certain of our products changes in laws and regulations or in related interpretation and policies and new laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations and limit our ability to sell our products and services in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and debarment as a government contractor these improper actions could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cyber threats 

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements it may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including i limitations on creation of liens on assets of textron inc or of its manufacturing subsidiaries ii maintenance of existence and properties and iii maintenance of a maximum debt to capital ratio as defined and excluding our finance segment of 65 the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes also contain covenants including limitations on creation of liens on certain principal manufacturing facilities and shares of stock of subsidiaries that own such facilities and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions with respect to such facilities in addition both the credit facility and the indentures provide that consolidations mergers or sale of all or substantially all of our assets may be effected only if we comply with certain provisions some of these covenants may limit our ability to engage in certain financing structures create liens sell assets or effect a consolidation or merger 

  

our credit facility also contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than any of our subsidiaries that primarily are engaged in the business of a finance company of more than 100 million similarly the supplemental indenture governing our convertible notes contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than tfc or its subsidiaries of more than 100 million therefore cessna finance export corporation a subsidiary of textron inc that is the borrower under our exportimport bank facilities and textron aviation finance corporation a subsidiary of textron inc that is the borrower under our export development canada edc facilities would be included within the crossdefault provision of the supplemental indenture for the convertible notes although not within the similar provision in our credit facility as a result a failure to pay or a continued default under any one or more of these facilities if related to aggregate outstanding indebtedness of 100 million or more could give rise to an event of default with respect to our convertible notes 

in addition a bankruptcy or monetary judgment in excess of 100 million against us or any of our subsidiaries that accounts for more than 5 of our consolidated revenues or our consolidated assets including our finance subsidiaries also could result in an event of default under our credit facility and a bankruptcy against us or any of our nonfinance “significant subsidiaries” within the meaning of the securities and exchange commission’s rules also would result in an event of default under the indenture governing our convertible notes 

our failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility or the indentures or the failure of certain of our subsidiaries to comply with their debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could impact our unfunded status of the plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity changes in the funded status of these plans are recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the year in which they occur also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate would increase the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits moreover we expect that some of the requirements of the new comprehensive healthcare law will increase our future costs increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 6200 of our us employees or 25 of our total us employees are unionized and approximately 2600 of our nonus employees or 32 of our total nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

in addition the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates in particular the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in 

  

foreign currency rates could adversely affect our profitability in future periods we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

we establish reserves to cover uncollectable finance receivables and accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns environmental remediation warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience andor current market conditions and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers as well as changing market conditions 

due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by climatic factors or by pilot driver or user error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

consolidated manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was 833 and 835 in 2011 and 2010 respectively on a dollar basis consolidated cost of sales increased 703 million 8 in 2011 principally due to higher sales volume in the cessna bell and industrial segments in 2011 gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to favorable product mix and improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume at cessna and bell these improvements were partially offset by a 64 million increase in engineering and development expenses throughout our manufacturing businesses and 60 million in charges at textron systems related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and severance costs in 2011 on a consolidated basis selling and administrative expense decreased 48 million 4 to 12 billion compared with 2010 primarily due to 44 million in lower operating expense at the finance segment largely reflecting progress towards our exit from the noncaptive commercial finance business and a 23 million decrease in corporate expense primarily due to the impact of changes in our stock price on compensation expense these decreases were partially offset by higher bid and proposal costs at textron systems in 2011 

in 2010 and 2009 cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues remained flat at 835 on a dollar basis cost of sales increased 137 million 2 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to the net sales volume changes in the industrial bell and cessna segments described above as well as higher pension costs and inflation in 2010 favorable conversion costs in the bell and industrial segments resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes were offset by increased conversion costs at cessna conversion costs increased at cessna as cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and facility consolidations did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes in 2010 selling and administrative expense decreased 107 million 8 to 12 billion compared with 2009 primarily due to 41 million in lower expenses in the finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with our exit from the noncaptive commercial finance business 39 million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower cessna sales volume and 27 million lower corporate expenses 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest 

our consolidated interest expense decreased 24 million 9 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a decrease for the finance group largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the noncaptive portfolio in 2010 consolidated interest expense decreased 39 million 13 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 63 million decrease for the finance group largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the noncaptive portfolio this decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense for the manufacturing group of 24 million primarily due to the fullyear impact in 2010 of convertible notes issued in may 2009 

  

provision for losses on finance receivables 

 

 the provision for loan losses decreased 131 million in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a decline in new troubled accounts in the finance segment’s noncaptive portfolio during 2011 and a 36 million reversal of the allowance for losses related to one significant timeshare account in 2010 the provision decreased 124 million from 2009 primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year 

valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

on a periodic basis we evaluate our liquidation strategy for the noncaptive finance portfolios as we continue to execute our exit plan in connection with this evaluation we also review our definition of the foreseeable future due to the relative stability of the golf market through the end of 2011 we believe that the foreseeable future now can be extended to a period of one to two years as opposed to the six to ninemonth period we previously used based on this change in the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining golf mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future and accordingly transferred 458 million of the remaining golf mortgage finance receivables net of an 80 million allowance for loan losses from the held for investment classification to the held for sale classification these finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer resulting in a 186 million charge recorded to valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 

special charges 

there were no amounts recorded within special charges in 2011 in 2010 and 2009 special charges included restructuring charges related to a global restructuring program that totaled 99 million and 237 million respectively primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business this restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company in the fourth quarter of 2010 we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program which included workforce reductions in the bell textron systems and industrial segments and at corporate along with the decision to exit a plant in the industrial segment upon the completion of this program at the end of 2010 we had terminated approximately 12100 positions worldwide representing approximately 28 of our global workforce since the inception of the program and had exited 30 leased and owned facilities and plants 

in 2010 special charges also included a 91 million noncash pretax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the statement of operations as a result of substantially liquidating a canadian finance entity in 2009 special charges also include a goodwill impairment charge of 80 million in the industrial segment 

other losses gains net 

in 2011 other losses gains net includes 55 million in losses on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes which was largely offset by a 52 million gain from the collection on notes receivable in connection with the disposition of the fluid  power business in 2008 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in 2009 we recorded a 50 million gain on the sale of assets related to cescom 

income tax expense benefit 

our effective rate was 281 in 2011 64 in 2010 and 510 in 2009 and generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective rate impact in the periods presented include primarily canada and china we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the united states our effective rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our us and foreign operations for a full reconciliation of our effective rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

segment analysis 

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments cessna bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment excludes special charges and includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest expense 

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenue represent increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup ramp up and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 

approximately 31 of our revenues were derived from contracts with the us government for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume changes in program performance or changes in contract mix changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

textron systems 

 

 as textron systems sells many of its products to the us government its business environment continues to be shaped by policy and budget decisions determined by the us government recent actions of the president and congress indicate an ongoing emphasis on federal budget deficit reduction and budget decisions by the president and congress may considerably reduce discretionary spending of which defense constitutes a significant share based on the continued deterioration of this environment the results of our annual operating plan review which included updated longrange forecast estimates and the loss of certain contracts we determined that an indicator of potential asset impairment existed in the fourth quarter requiring us to perform impairment tests based on our analysis we determined that certain intangible assets were impaired and recorded a 41 million pretax impairment charge to write down intangible assets primarily related to customer agreements and contractual relationships associated with aailogistics  technical services and aaitest  training businesses 

also in the fourth quarter of 2011 we initiated a workforce reduction at textron systems to streamline our cost structure that will eliminate over 10 of the segment’s workforce in 2012 this reduction is intended to improve our ability to efficiently execute and compete for potentially fewer opportunities with the department of defense and other customers we recorded a 19 million charge primarily for severance costs related to this action 

textron systems revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2011 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below

 industrial revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2011 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

 

 industrial segment sales increased 261 million 10 in 2011 from 2010 volume increased and mix improved largely due to a 117 million increase in the fuel systems and functional components product line reflecting higher automotive industry demand and 21 million in the other industrial product lines largely related to the powered tools testing and measurement equipment product line reflecting higher sales in north america and europe the favorable foreign exchange impact was primarily related to strengthening of the euro which mostly impacted the fuel systems and functional components product line higher other industrial revenues of 78 million included a 27 million impact from acquisitions and improved pricing of 20 million in addition to the higher volume 

operating expenses for the industrial segment increased 221 million 9 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a 115 million increase in direct material costs due to higher sales volume a 68 million impact from foreign exchange related to strengthening of the euro and 40 million in inflation for direct materials related to various commodity and material components throughout the segment 

factors contributing to the 2010 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below

factors contributing to 2010 yearoveryear segment profit change are provided below 

 

 industrial segment profit increased 135 million 500 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the 127 million impact from higher volume and 76 million in improved performance partially offset by inflation in excess of higher pricing of 59 million the improved cost performance in 2010 was largely due to the significant efforts made in 2009 to reduce costs through workforce reductions and other initiatives along with improved manufacturing leverage due to higher volume 

finance 

 

 our plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business of our finance segment is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales depending on market conditions we expect continued progress in liquidating the remaining 950 million in the noncaptive portfolio over the next several years 

finance revenues

 finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment 

 

 finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics above finance receivables held for sale in the noncaptive portfolio totaled 418 million at the end of 2011 compared with 413 million at the end of 2010 as the transfer of the remaining golf mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification was largely offset by sales and liquidations this transfer also resulted in an 80 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses at the end of 2011 finance receivables reported in the above table included 532 million of finance receivables held for investment in the noncaptive portfolio reflecting a 13 billion reduction from the 2010 yearend balance for this portfolio primarily due to liquidations and the transfer of the remaining golf mortgage portfolio 

  

nonaccrual finance receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three months unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful as well as accounts whose credit quality indicators other than delinquency suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful nonaccrual finance receivables decreased 529 million 62 from the yearend balance primarily due to the following reductions 

 

  

 these factors were also the primary reason for the improvement in the 60 days contractual delinquency amount 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the nonaccrual finance receivables by product line along with a summary of finance receivables held for investment based on our internally assigned credit quality indicators 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of tfc its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

 

 we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that with our existing cash and equivalents along with the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 

in 2011 textron inc entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion up to 200 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit at december 31 2011 there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 38 million of letters of credits issued against it 

we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities in september 2011 we issued 250 million in 4625 notes due 2016 and 250 million in 5950 notes due 2021 under this registration statement 

  

in september 2011 we announced a cash tender offer for any and all of the outstanding convertible notes in accordance with the terms of the tender offer for each 1000 principal amount of the convertible notes tendered we paid the holder 1524 plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the october 13 2011 settlement date in the aggregate the holders validly tendered 225 million principal amount or 375 of the convertible notes subsequent to the tender offer we also purchased 151 million principal amount of the convertible notes in a small number of privately negotiated transactions and retired another 8 million related to a holderinitiated conversion in the fourth quarter of 2011 by the end of 2011 we had paid approximately 580 million in cash related to these transactions and had reduced the principal amount of the convertible notes by 64 at december 31 2011 216 million principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended december 31 2011 our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price for the convertible notes of 1706 per share accordingly the remaining notes are convertible at the holder’s option through march 31 2012 we may deliver shares of common stock cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash we have continued to classify these convertible notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us 

during 2011 we reduced our total finance receivable portfolio by 17 billion primarily through liquidations marktomarket adjustments on certain portfolios and impairments these finance receivable reductions occurred in both the noncaptive and captive finance portfolios but were primarily driven by the noncaptive portfolio in connection with our exit plan including 576 million and 495 million in the timeshare and golf mortgage product lines respectively depending on market conditions we expect continued progress in liquidating the remaining 950 million in the noncaptive portfolio over the next several years 

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

 

 cash flows from operating activities increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings for the manufacturing group in addition cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to 38 million in 2011 from 58 million in 2010 and 132 million in 2009 these decreases were partially offset by 225 million in higher cash contributions made to our pension plans as we made 642 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2011 compared with 417 million in contributions in 2010 

investing cash flows in 2011 2010 and 2009 primarily included capital expenditures of 423 million 270 million and 238 million respectively as we increased investment in the areas of new product development and cost productivity improvements 

in 2011 financing activities primarily consisted of 580 million in payments related to the purchase and cancellation of convertible notes that were originally issued in 2009 as described above and 175 million in intergroup financing for our finance group partially offset by 496 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes we used significantly more cash for financing activities in 2010 compared with 2009 largely due to the repayment of 12 billion on our bank credit lines in 2010 that we had drawn on in 2009 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 22 million 22 million and 21 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc textron inc is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million cash contributions paid to tfc to maintain compliance with the support agreement and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 

 

   

an additional cash contribution of 240 million was paid to tfc on january 17 2012 as required by the support agreement and on january 20 2012 tfc paid an additional 172 million in dividends to textron inc 

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

 

 cash flows from operating activities improved in 2011 largely due to 65 million in tax refunds net of payments received in 2011 in 2010 the finance group had 101 million in tax payments net of refunds primarily attributable to the settlement of the irs’s challenge of tax deductions we took in prior years for certain leverage lease transactions in 2009 tax refunds net of payments totaled 75 million 

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled 18 billion in 2011 30 billion in 2010 and 54 billion in 2009 cash outflows for originations declined to 05 billion in 2011 from 09 billion in 2010 and 37 billion in 2009 these decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the noncaptive business 

in 2011 and 2010 financing activities include repayments of 14 billion and 03 billion respectively against the outstanding balance on tfc’s bank line of credit that we had drawn down in 2009 in october 2011 we paid off and elected to terminate this bank line of credit as we liquidate the noncaptive business we have continued to pay down our debt with principal payments on short and longterm debt of 08 billion 21 billion and 45 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of 04 billion 02 billion and 03 billion respectively 

tfc borrowed funds from textron inc in 2011 2010 and 2009 with interest to pay down maturing debt as of december 31 2011 and january 1 2011 the outstanding balance due to textron inc for these borrowings was 490 million and 315 million respectively 

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

 

 cash flow from operating activities increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings for the manufacturing group in addition cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to 44 million in 2011 from 72 million in 2010 and 144 million in 2009 these decreases were partially offset by 225 million in higher cash pension contributions made on behalf of the manufacturing group with 642 million in contributions in 2011 compared with 417 million in contributions in 2010 

  

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled 12 billion in 2011 22 billion in 2010 and 46 billion in 2009 cash outflows for originations declined to 02 billion in 2011 from 05 billion in 2010 and 30 billion in 2009 these decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the noncaptive business 

we also used more cash for investing activities in the current year due to higher capital expenditures which totaled 423 million 270 million and 238 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively as we increased investment in the areas of new product development and cost productivity improvements 

in 2011 and 2010 financing activities include repayments of 14 billion and 15 billion respectively against the outstanding balance on our bank line of credit that we had drawn down in 2009 we also made principal payments on shortand longterm debt of 08 billion 22 billion and 58 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these reductions were largely related to the liquidation of the noncaptive business and debt maturities in 2011 financing activities include 580 million in payments related to the purchase of convertible notes that were originally issued in 2009 cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of 09 billion 02 billion and 09 billion respectively 

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

 

 consolidated discontinued operations cash flows 

cash flows from discontinued operations in 2009 primarily include approximately 280 million in aftertax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron partially offset by 69 million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid  power business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions

 on december 31 2011 the finance group also had 316 million in other liabilities primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 

finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management’s evaluation and analysis by product line for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value with either a the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate or b the fair value if the finance receivable is collateral dependent the expected future cash flows consider collateral value financial performance and liquidity of our borrower existence and financial strength of guarantors estimated recovery costs including legal expenses and costs associated with the repossessionforeclosure and eventual disposal of collateral when there is a range of potential outcomes we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence 

the evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral which may differ from actual results while our analysis is specific to each individual account certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line which are discussed in detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio for homogeneous portfolios including aviation and golf equipment the allowance is established as a percentage of nonrecourse finance receivables which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience current delinquency and default trends collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends for nonhomogeneous portfolios such as timeshare the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience industry trends and collateral values we classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

finance receivables 

finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors including but not limited to contractual duration type of collateral credit strength of the borrowers interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables on an ongoing basis these factors combined with our overall liquidation strategy determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which finance receivables we will hold for sale our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our finance receivables a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables 

if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future until maturity or payoff the finance receivables are transferred to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time conversely if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity these receivables would be designated as held for sale and a valuation allowance would be established at that time if necessary at december 31 2011 if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements see page 68 in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the finance receivables held for investment excluding leases that currently are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 

finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value there are no active quoted market prices for our finance receivables the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return financing cost capital structure andor discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses payment rates and expectations of borrowers’ ability to make scheduled balloon payments on a timely basis where available assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans perceived to be of similar credit quality although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures industries and collateral types therefore all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 

see page 67 in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of changes in fair value and the classification of finance receivables for the past two years 

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

at the outset of each contract we estimate the initial profit booking rate the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product schedule for example the number and type of milestone events and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical schedule and costs aspects of the contract likewise the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks and as a result our estimated costs at completion increase all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and therefore may affect the profit booking rate when adjustments are required any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catchup method with the impact of the change from inceptiontodate recorded in the current period 

the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the two years ended december 31 2011 

 

 goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment in which case such component is the reporting unit in certain instances we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that permits companies to perform a qualitative assessment based on economic industry and companyspecific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units based on the results of the qualitative assessment companies are only required to perform step 1 of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount as permitted we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reduce the costs associated with determining each reporting unit’s fair value for the units where it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds its carrying amount 

for the reporting units for which we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment we performed a step 1 analysis which required us to calculate fair value of each reporting unit if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined in step 2 of the goodwill impairment test in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit’s short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions current cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

based on our annual review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the step 1 impairment test in the foreseeable future 

  

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2011 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 784 compared with 826 in 2010 in 2011 and 2010 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 800 and 850 respectively a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2011 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 22 million 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2011 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 571 compared with 620 in 2010 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 575 in 2011 compared with 625 for 2010 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2011 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately 23 million 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2011 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2011 medical rate of 9 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2021 and then remain at that level the 2011 prescription drug rate of 9 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2021 and then remain at that level see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

warranty liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations 

  

new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary for our finance group we limit our risk to changes in interest rates for the captive business with a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities which includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 

foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured andor sold for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 06 billion at the end of 2011 and 2010 

the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for 2011 and 2010 from the prior year for each period is provided below 

 

 quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts 

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar

finance segment 

our finance segment or the finance group is a commercial finance business that consists of textron financial corporation tfc and its consolidated subsidiaries along with three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc in the fourth quarter of 2008 we announced a plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture we made the decision to exit this business in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of the disruption and instability in the capital markets the noncaptive business is based primarily in north america and includes the following product lines distribution finance golf mortgage structured capital and timeshare the exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales during 2010 we reduced our owned and managed receivable portfolio by approximately 24 billion and expect depending on market conditions to substantially liquidate the remaining noncaptive portfolio over the next three to five years 

our finance segment continues to originate new customer relationships and finance receivables in the captive finance business which provides financing primarily for new cessna aircraft and bell helicopters and to a lesser extent for new ezgo and jacobsen golf and turfcare equipment we also provide financing to purchasers of preowned cessna aircraft and bell helicopters on a limited basis new finance receivables are originated primarily outside the united states originations in the us primarily finance purchases of textronmanufactured products for purchasers who have had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 our finance group paid our manufacturing group 04 billion 06 billion and 10 billion respectively related to the sale of textronmanufactured products to third parties that were financed by the finance group our cessna and industrial segments also received proceeds in those years of 10 million 13 million and 18 million respectively from the sale of equipment from their manufacturing operations to our finance group for use under operating lease agreements 

the commercial finance business traditionally has been extremely competitive our finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions including banks leasing companies commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price term structure and service 

our finance segment’s largest business risks are continued access to financing through the capital markets and the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio see “finance portfolio quality” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 27 for a discussion of the credit quality of this portfolio 

backlog 

our backlog at the end of 2010 and 2009 is summarized below 

 

orders from cessna customers which cover a wide spectrum of industries worldwide are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive purchase agreement and the initial customer deposit is received we work with our customers to provide estimated delivery dates which may be adjusted based on the customers’ needs or our production schedule but do not establish definitive delivery dates until approximately six months before expected delivery there is considerable uncertainty as to when or whether backlog will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability these factors also may be impacted by the economy and public perceptions of private corporate jet usage while backlog is an indicator of future revenues we cannot reasonably estimate the year each order in backlog ultimately will result in revenues and cash flows 

  

orders remain in backlog until the aircraft is delivered or upon cancellation by the customer upon cancellation deposits are used to defray costs including remarketing fees cost to reconfigure the aircraft and other costs incurred as a result of the cancellation remaining deposits if any may be retained or refunded at our discretion 

approximately 58 of our total backlog at january 1 2011 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2011 

the us government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract the difference between the award value of the contract and the amount formally appropriated funded represents unfunded backlog at january 1 2011 substantially all us government backlog included in the above table was funded under a multiyear procurement contract with the us government for the purchase of v22 tiltrotor aircraft bell has 49 billion of funded backlog included in the above table bell also has approximately 12 billion of unfunded orders under the v22 program that have not yet been appropriated and are not included in the above table 

us government contracts 

in 2010 approximately 34 of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the us government this business is subject to competition changes in procurement policies and regulations the continuing availability of funding which is dependent upon congressional appropriations national and international priorities for defense spending world events and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate 

our contracts with the us government generally may be terminated by the us government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract if the us government terminates a contract for convenience we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination including if applicable reasonable profit on such work as well as reasonable termination costs if however the us government terminates a contract for default generally a we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted an agreedupon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the us government b the us government will not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract and c we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impact our business financial condition or results of operations perhaps materially 

we have customer concentration with the us government 

during 2010 we derived approximately 34 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our ability to compete successfully for and retain us government business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for a us government program in which we provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program and could have a negative impact on our results of operations significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced in accordance with contract terms by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts in addition on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in any such event our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as a us government contractor we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials several of our us government contracts contain provisions that mandate us to disclose whether or not we have been the subject of a proceeding that resulted in a criminal conviction based on certain statutes certain findings of civil liability and certain administrative determinations of fault or a settlement with an acknowledgment of fault in connection with the performance of a government contract failure to properly and timely disclose may result in a termination for default or cause suspension andor debarment and potential fines in addition we are subject to audits by the defense contract audit agency to assure our compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time also changes in procurement policies budget considerations unexpected us developments such as terrorist attacks or similar political developments or events abroad that may change the us government’s national security defense posture may affect sales to government entities these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

the department of defense dod has announced plans for significant changes to its business practices that could have a material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

recently the dod has announced various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors the most recent initiatives are 

  

organized in five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy these new initiatives are expected to impact significantly the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers and they could have a significant impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and if so how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so 

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

under fixedprice contracts as a general rule we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts may adversely affect our results of operations under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

weak demand for our aircraft products may continue to adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of the recent worldwide economic downturn over the past several years we have experienced weak demand for our new and used aircraft a tightening of credit availability for potential purchasers of our aircraft and a substantial number of cancellations of orders and customer requests for delayed delivery of ordered aircraft soft demand for new and used business jets and helicopters could persist and could continue to adversely impact the pricing of new aircraft and the valuation of used aircraft in addition both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example restrictions andor fees related to carbon emissions levels that may adversely impact demand for business jets andor helicopters a prolonged weakness in the markets for our commercial aircraft products could adversely impact our results of operations and our future prospects 

we may not be able to continue to execute the liquidation of our finance segment’s noncaptive commercial finance business at a favorable pace and level of recovery 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we announced a plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture the exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to accomplish the orderly liquidation of our portfolio on a timely or successful basis or in a manner that will generate cash sufficient to service our finance segment’s debt we may encounter delays and difficulties in effecting the continued orderly liquidation of our various receivable portfolios as a result of many factors including the inability of our customers to find alternative financing which could expose us to increased credit losses we may have greater difficulty in selling the remaining receivables that have been designated for sale or transfer assets that have been acquired upon foreclosure of receivables andor other nonoperating assets at the pricing that we anticipate or in the time frame that we anticipate we may be required to make additional marktomarket or other adjustments against assets that we intend to sell or to take additional reserves against assets that we intend to retain we may change our current strategy based on either our performance and liquidity position or changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our assets which could result in changes in the classification of assets we intend to hold for investment and additional marktomarket adjustments we may incur higher costs than anticipated as a result of this exit plan or be subject to claims made by third parties and the exit plan may result in increased credit losses we expect that our portfolio quality will continue to deteriorate as we proceed through the liquidation and the asset mix changes and that our cash conversion ratio on liquidation will decrease this deterioration could be more severe and the cash conversion ratio lower than we anticipate resulting in greater losses significant delay or difficulty in executing the continued liquidation andor substantial losses could result in the failure of our portfolio to generate the cash necessary to service our finance segment’s indebtedness resulting in continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

difficult conditions in the financial markets have adversely affected the quality of our finance segment’s finance asset portfolios and our losses may increase if we are unable to successfully collect our finance receivables or realize sufficient value from collateral 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other assets in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality geographic or industry concentrations and the effect of the recent economic downturn on our customers’ businesses as well as the broader deterioration of the financial markets as a result of the tumultuous conditions in the financial markets over the past two years many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers these conditions have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies and defaults lack of consumer confidence increased market volatility widespread reduction of business activity and bankruptcy filings valuations of the types of collateral securing our timeshare and other portfolios have been and may continue to be adversely affected by increased consumer delinquencies the reduction in business activity and bankruptcy proceedings involving our borrowers valuations of the types of collateral securing our captive finance portfolio particularly valuations of used aircraft have decreased significantly over the past two years and may continue to decrease if weak economic conditions continue declining collateral values could result in greater 

  

delinquencies and foreclosures as customers elect to discontinue payments on loan balances that exceed asset values bankruptcy proceedings involving our borrowers may prevent or delay our ability to exercise our rights and remedies and realize the full value of our collateral our losses may increase if our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our finance receivable portfolio if these negative market conditions persist or worsen the finance segment may experience further deterioration in its ability to successfully collect its finance receivables or realize sufficient value from collateral which may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

payments required under our support agreement with tfc could restrict our use of capital 

during the past several years we have made quarterly capital contributions to tfc as required under the terms of our support agreement with tfc to maintain both the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and the leverage ratio required by tfc’s credit facility a summary of the capital contributions paid to tfc and dividends received from tfc is provided on page 29 we will likely be required to make additional capital contributions to tfc in the future in order to maintain this ratio while capital contributions to tfc may not increase the aggregate amount of outstanding consolidated indebtedness of textron and tfc such contributions could restrict our allocation of available capital for other purposes in addition recently from time to time tfc has borrowed from us to meet its liquidity needs and is expected to require further borrowings from us for its liquidity needs in the future depending upon market conditions tfc’s need for borrowings from us could restrict our use of funds for other purposes 

failure to maintain credit ratings acceptable to investors may increase the cost of our funding and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets 

the major rating agencies regularly evaluate us including tfc for purposes of assigning credit ratings our ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain financing as well as our access to the capital markets 

we may need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due although we currently have access to the capital markets we may not be able to refinance our credit facilities or maturing debt at the time that such financing is necessary at terms that are acceptable to us or at all if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our ability to fund our captive financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets 

our finance segment’s ability to continue to offer customer financing for the products that we manufacture and the longterm viability and profitability of the captive finance business is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost this ability and cost in turn are dependent on our credit ratings and are subject to credit market volatility if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing or if we are unable to offer competitive customer financing it could negatively impact our manufacturing group’s ability to generate sales which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global information technology infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers we depend on these vendors subcontractors and service providers to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations 

our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft 

such events may adversely affect our financial results damage our reputation and relationships with our customers result in regulatory actions andor result in product liability claims likewise any disruption of our information technology systems or other outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our financial results 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements in our current and future markets and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed changes in environmental laws and regulations for example those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including costs to defend regulatory reviews we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through our research and development efforts likewise new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products our failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

our international business including us exports exposes us to certain unique and potentially greater risks than our domestic business our exposure to such risks increases as our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices which may change from time to time including regulations relating to importexport control environmental health and safety investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks these international risks may be especially significant with respect to aerospace and defense products for which we sometimes first must obtain licenses and authorizations from various us government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside the us any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside the us could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition additionally some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows additionally we are facing increasing competition in our international markets from foreign and multinational firms that may have certain home country advantages over us as a result our ability to compete successfully in those markets may be adversely affected which could negatively impact our revenues 

we maintain manufacturing facilities services centers supply centers and other facilities worldwide including in various emerging market countries and we expect that our investment in emerging market countries will continue to increase emerging market operations can present many risks including civil disturbances economic and government instability terrorism and related safety concerns health concerns cultural differences in employment and business practices the imposition of exchange controls and risks associated with inadequate infrastructures to deal with natural disasters the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws any such violation by any of our international representatives consultants subcontractors or suppliers even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

as a global business we are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate our increased focus on international sales and global operations requires importing and exporting goods and technology some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent importexport controls across international borders on a regular basis both us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity in addition we could be affected by us or foreign laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns changes in laws and regulations or in related interpretation and policies and new laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business affect how we conduct our operations and limit our ability to sell our products and services in addition a violation of us andor foreign laws by one of our 

  

employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and debarment as a government contractor these improper actions could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers 

intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted by third parties against us or our customers any related indemnification payments or legal costs we may be obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses our customers or other third parties could be costly in addition we own the rights to many patents trademarks brand names trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our intellectual property could be at risk due to various cyber threats 

certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues 

as a distributor of consumer products in the us certain of our products also are subject to the consumer product safety act which empowers the us consumer product safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous under certain circumstances the cpsc could require us to repair replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products or potentially even discontinue entire product lines or we may voluntarily do so but within strictures recommended by the cpsc the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for noncompliance with its requirements furthermore failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands additionally laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states as well as in other countries in which we sell our products and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements it may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including i limitations on creation of liens on assets of textron inc or of its manufacturing subsidiaries ii maintenance of existence and properties and iii maintenance of a maximum debt to capital ratio as defined and excluding our finance segment of 65 the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes also contain covenants including limitations on creation of liens on certain principal manufacturing facilities and shares of stock of subsidiaries that own such facilities and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions with respect to such facilities in addition both the credit facility and the indentures provide that consolidations mergers or sale of all or substantially all of our assets may be effected only if we comply with certain provisions some of these covenants may limit our ability to engage in certain financing structures create liens sell assets or effect a consolidation or merger 

our credit facility also contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than any of our subsidiaries that primarily are engaged in the business of a finance company of more than 100 million similarly the supplemental indenture governing our convertible notes contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than tfc or its subsidiaries of more than 100 million therefore cessna finance export corporation a subsidiary of textron inc that is the borrower under the exportimport bank facility entered into on july 14 2009 and textron aviation finance corporation a subsidiary of textron inc that is the borrower under the economic development canada bank edc facility entered into on august 6 2010 would be included within the crossdefault provision of the supplemental indenture for the convertible notes although not within the similar provision in our credit facility as a result a failure to pay or a continued default under the exportimport bank facility or the edc facility if the outstanding balance thereunder exceeded 100 million could give rise to an event of default with respect to our convertible notes 

in addition a bankruptcy or monetary judgment in excess of 100 million against us or any of our subsidiaries that accounts for more than 5 of our consolidated revenues or our consolidated assets including our finance subsidiaries also would result in an event of default under our credit facility and a bankruptcy against us or any of our nonfinance “significant subsidiaries” within the meaning 

  

of the securities and exchange commission’s rules also would result in an event of default under the indenture governing our convertible notes 

our failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility or the indentures or the failure of certain of our subsidiaries to comply with their debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where required contributions to those plans and related expenses are driven by among other things our assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth additionally as part of our annual evaluation of these plans significant changes in our assumptions due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances or changes in our actual investment returns could impact our unfunded status of the plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity changes in the funded status of these plans are recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the year in which they occur also changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans 

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate would increase the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits moreover congress recently has enacted a comprehensive healthcare law and we are evaluating the potential impacts of this new law on our costs we expect that some of the requirements of this new law will increase our future costs increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 5900 of our us employees or 24 of our total us employees are unionized and approximately 2500 of our nonus employees or 33 of our total nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

in addition the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

we establish reserves to cover uncollectable finance receivables and accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns environmental remediation warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience andor current market conditions and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers as well as changing market conditions 

due to the nature of our manufacturing business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by climatic factors or by pilot or driver error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

2010 was a year marked by continued global and economic challenges and yet also was a year in which we made significant progress with cost initiatives strengthened our overall capital position and had strong execution that allowed us to deliver improved financial results cash generated from our manufacturing businesses enabled us to continue to invest in products and technologies that will position us for future growth as the economy recovers 

we completed our restructuring program in 2010 which has driven out costs in all of our segments since the inception of the program in late 2008 we have lowered our headcount by 28 and have exited 30 facilities 

during 2010 we continued to make significant progress in our plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business in our finance segment by liquidating a total of 24 billion in finance receivables across the segment 18 billion of which were receivables in our noncaptive portfolio through discounted payoffs portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization 

our liquidity position strengthened during the year as our businesses generated positive operating cash flow as a result we paid off the manufacturing group’s drawn 125 billion credit facility in its entirety and paid down the finance group’s 175 billion drawn credit facility by 300 million in addition we strengthened the funding level of our pension plans with a 350 million voluntary contribution in the fourth quarter of 2010 

revenues 

 

revenues increased 25 million in 2010 compared with 2009 this increase was due to significant revenue increases in the industrial bell and textron systems segments that were largely offset by lower revenue in the cessna and finance segments the net revenue increase included the following factors 

 

in 2009 revenues decreased 35 billion 25 to 105 billion compared with 2008 this decrease was primarily due to the following factors 

 

 

 

  

cost of sales 

 

cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues remained flat at 835 in 2010 and 2009 on a dollar basis cost of sales increased 137 million 2 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to the net sales volume changes in the industrial bell and cessna segments described above as well as higher pension costs and inflation in 2010 favorable conversion costs in the bell and industrial segments resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes were offset by increased conversion costs at cessna conversion costs increased at cessna as cost reduction activities including workforce reductions and facility consolidations did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes 

cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues increased to 835 in 2009 from 796 in 2008 on a dollar basis cost of sales decreased 21 billion 20 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the sales volume changes in the cessna and industrial segments described above in 2009 cost of sales was unfavorably impacted from lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns in the cessna and industrial segments resulting in increased conversion costs and idle capacity 

selling and administrative expense 

 

selling and administrative expense decreased 107 million 8 to 12 billion in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to 41 million in lower expenses in the finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with its exit from the noncaptive commercial finance business 39 million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower cessna sales volume and 27 million lower corporate expenses 

in 2009 selling and administrative expense decreased 252 million 16 to 13 billion compared with 2008 primarily due to workforce reductions and furlough programs resulting in lower compensation and related costs lower sales commissions at cessna and a decline in professional services and travel costs due to costreduction efforts 

special charges 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business this restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company in the fourth quarter of 2010 we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program which included workforce reductions in the bell textron systems and industrial segments and at corporate along with the decision to exit a plant in the industrial segment with the completion of this program at the end of 2010 we have terminated approximately 12100 positions worldwide representing approximately 28 of our global workforce since the inception of the program and have exited 30 leased and owned facilities and plants 

special charges included restructuring charges of 99 million 237 million and 64 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges in 2010 special charges also included a 91 million noncash pretax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the statement of operations as a result of substantially liquidating a canadian finance entity in 2009 special charges also include a goodwill impairment charge of 80 million in the industrial segment in 2008 special charges include an initial marktomarket adjustment of 293 million that was made when we classified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale in connection with our decision to sell the noncaptive portion of our finance business along with a goodwill impairment charge of 169 million in the finance segment 

  

interest expense 

 

interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest 

our consolidated interest expense decreased 39 million 13 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a 63 million decrease for the finance group largely due to the reduction in its debt as it liquidates the noncaptive commercial finance business this decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense for the manufacturing group of 24 million primarily due to the full year impact in 2010 of convertible notes issued in may 2009 in 2009 consolidated interest expense decreased 139 million 31 compared with 2008 primarily due to reduced debt in the finance group as it liquidated receivables 

segment analysis 

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments cessna bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume changes in revenue represents increasesdecreases in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits pension or other costs cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup rampup and costreduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs for the us government business performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catchup adjustments in the current period

cessna revenues and operating expenses 

factors contributing to the 2010 yearoveryear revenue change are provided below 

 

cessna’s revenues decreased 757 million 23 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower volume of business jets reflecting the continued downturn in the business jet market attributable to the economic recession we delivered 179 citation business jets in 2010 versus 289 jets in 2009 increased aircraft utilization and our investment in additional service capacity during 2010 contributed to increased aftermarket volume as cessna’s aftermarket revenues increased by 80 million 14 from 2009 

  

operating expenses decreased by 530 million 17 in 2010 compared with 2009 largely due to a decline in direct material and labor costs principally as a result of the reduced volume during 2010 cessna’s cost reduction activities were not able to fully offset the lower volume

portfolio losses recognized in 2009 include discounts taken on the sale or early termination of finance assets including 60 million in discounts associated with the liquidation of distribution finance and golf mortgage finance receivables 53 million in impairment charges related to automobile manufacturing equipment and investments in real estate associated with matured leveraged leases in the structured capital portfolio and 25 million in impairment charges associated with repossessed aircraft 

finance segment loss 

the finance segment loss decreased by 57 million 19 in 2010 compared with 2009 as the provision for loan losses decreased by 124 million primarily due to a decline in the accounts identified as nonaccrual during the year and we had 81 million in lower portfolio losses net of gains and 28 million in lower securitization losses net of gains these improvements were partially offset by the 

  

impact of lower gains on debt extinguishment of 54 million a 16 million impact from lower interest rates on debt and 16 million in lower accretion of the valuation allowance on finance receivables held for sale in addition as we effected the exit of our noncaptive finance business our lower average finance receivables had a 52 million unfavorable impact on segment profit along with 39 million in lower servicing fees investment and other income and a 26 million impact related to variablerate receivable interest rate floors these factors were partially offset by lower operating and administrative expenses of 41 million primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with the workforce reduction 

in 2009 the finance segment’s loss increased 244 million 488 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 157 million impact from higher portfolio losses 70 million in lower securitization gains net of impairments 37 million in higher suspended earnings on nonaccrual finance receivables and a 33 million increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by 55 million in gains on debt extinguishment in 2009 and 2008 we increased the provision for loan losses significantly in response to the economic recession declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance business in the fourth quarter of 2008 which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio in 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the rate and severity of defaults resulting from the economic recession and due to declining aircraft values the increase was partially offset by a 73 million decrease in the provision for the distribution finance portfolio largely due to the liquidation of 68 of its managed finance receivables in 2009 

finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics below 

 

at the end of 2010 finance receivables included 19 billion in finance receivables held for investment in the noncaptive business compared with 33 billion at the end of 2009 in addition finance receivables held for sale by the noncaptive business totaled 04 billion at the end of 2010 compared with 08 billion at the end of 2009 these decreases were due to the continued exit of this business as discussed above 

nonaccrual finance receivables include accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than three months unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful as well as accounts whose credit quality indicators other than delinquency suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful we believe that the percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables generally will remain high as we execute our noncaptive liquidation plan the liquidation plan is also likely to result in a slower rate of liquidation for nonaccrual finance receivables nonaccrual finance receivables decreased 190 million from the 2009 yearend balance with a 117 million reduction in the aviation product line a 55 million reduction in the distribution finance line and a 35 million reduction in the golf mortgage product line these net reductions were primarily due to the resolution of several significant accounts through the repossession of collateral restructure of finance receivables and cash collections partially offset by new finance receivables identified as nonaccrual in 2010 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the nonaccrual finance receivables by product line along with a summary of finance receivables held for investment based on our internally assigned credit quality indicators 

the percentage of contractual delinquency increased primarily due to one significant revolving notes receivable loan in the timeshare product line which has been classified as nonaccrual since 2009 but was not contractually past due until the borrower’s bankruptcy filing in 2010 partially offset by a reduction in delinquencies in the aviation and golf mortgage product lines primarily resulting from the repossession and foreclosure of collateral in the timeshare product line revolving notes receivable loans often remain contractually current despite significant uncertainty regarding the eventual collection of full principal and interest because we are entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the underlying consumer notes receivable which serve as the collateral for our loan see page 54 in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of delinquencies by aging category 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which also is the finance segment consists of tfc its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

 

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie leverage that is in place to support our capital structure as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage we believe that with our existing cash balances coupled with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business and cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 

we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities we also have credit line facilities available for the manufacturing group of 125 billion and for the finance group of 175 billion which both expire in april 2012 at january 1 2011 there were no amounts outstanding under the manufacturing group’s facility and 14 billion outstanding under the finance group’s facility 

during 2010 we liquidated 24 billion of the finance group’s finance receivables net of originations these finance receivable reductions occurred in both the noncaptive and captive finance portfolios but were primarily driven by the noncaptive portfolio in connection with our exit plan including 956 million in the distribution finance product line and 408 million in the timeshare product line these reductions resulted from the combination of scheduled finance receivable collections sales discounted payoffs repossession of collateral chargeoffs and impairment charges recorded as portfolio losses net of gains in our consolidated statements of operations in addition the reduction in finance receivables included 620 million in the captive finance portfolio primarily as a result of reduced loan and lease originations and the sale of 84 million of finance receivables we measure the success of the exit plan based on the percentage of total finance receivable and other finance asset reductions converted to cash in 2010 we had a cash conversion ratio of 93 compared with 95 in 2009 on our noncaptive finance receivables we expect the cash conversion ratio to continue to decline over the duration of the exit plan due to the change in mix from shorter term assets in the distribution finance product line to longer term assets in the timeshare golf mortgage and structured finance product lines and the existence of a higher concentration of nonaccrual finance receivables at the end of 2010 23 billion of finance receivables remained in the noncaptive portfolio 

on may 5 2009 we issued 600 million of 45 convertible senior notes with a maturity date of may 1 2013 as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended december 31 2010 our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price set forth for these convertible notes of 1706 per share accordingly the notes are convertible at the holder’s option through march 31 2011 we may deliver shares of common stock cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash we have continued to classify these convertible notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us 

  

manufacturing group cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below

 

in the aggregate cash flow from operating activities in 2010 was comparable with 2009 however our earnings for the manufacturing group adjusted for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization were stronger in 2010 and totaled 941 million compared with similarly adjusted earnings in 2009 of 701 million the cash inflow from higher earnings was offset by a 350 million voluntary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2010 which is included in the accrued and other liabilities line on the consolidated statement of cash flows we also used less cash for restructuring activities in 2010 compared with 2009 with cash payments of 58 million 132 million and 3 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

in 2009 cash flow from operating activities increased 331 million compared with 2008 largely due to 562 million in lower capital contributions paid to the finance group net of dividends received and working capital improvements partially offset by lower earnings in 2008 cash flow from operating activities included a 625 million capital contribution to the finance group as discussed below our use of working capital improved significantly in 2009 largely related to significant inventory reductions 

investing cash flows in 2010 2009 and 2008 primarily included capital expenditures of 270 million 238 million and 537 million respectively the decrease in 2009 is largely due to a reduction in discretionary spending due to the economic recession in addition the increase in investing activities in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to three acquisitions in the bell textron systems and industrial segments for 57 million in 2008 we paid 109 million for acquisitions primarily due to transaction settlements related to aai which was acquired at the end of 2007 

financing cash flows in 2010 primarily consist of the 12 billion repayment of the manufacturing group’s bank line of credit in 2009 financing activities provided more cash than in 2008 primarily due to the draw of our 12 billion bank line of credit a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings net proceeds of 442 million from the issuance of the convertible notes net of call options 333 million in cash from the issuance of our common stock and common stock warrants 595 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in dividends paid these increases in cash provided in 2009 were partially offset by an 869 million decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009 compared with an 867 million increase in these borrowings in 2008 in addition we made 412 million in payments to settle advances against our companyowned officer life insurance policies in 2009 while in 2008 we received 222 million in advances against these policies 

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 22 million 21 million and 284 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in 2009 from 2008 payments was due to a reduction in the annual per share dividend to 008 in 2009 from 092 in 2008 we have not repurchased any of our common stock other than in connection with an executive compensation award since we suspended all share repurchase activity under our repurchase program in september 2008 under boardauthorized share repurchase programs we spent 533 million in 2008 for share repurchases representing approximately 12 million shares of common stock 

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc textron inc is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million cash contributions paid to tfc to maintain compliance with the support agreement and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below

 

an additional cash contribution of 63 million was paid to tfc on january 11 2011 as required by the support agreement 

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

  

finance group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

 

cash flow from operating activities for the finance group decreased 231 million in 2010 compared with 2009 largely due to 103 million in taxes paid primarily attributable to a settlement related to the challenge of tax deductions we took in prior years for certain leverage lease transactions in 2009 the finance group received a tax refund of 75 million compared with tax payments of 52 million in 2008 which was partially offset by lower fee income in 2010 due to the winddown of the noncaptive business 

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities in 2010 and in 2009 finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled 30 billion in 2010 54 billion in 2009 and 119 billion in 2008 cash outflows for originations declined to 09 billion in 2010 from 37 billion in 2009 and 119 billion in 2008 

in 2010 the finance group used cash for financing activities primarily for repayments of longterm debt of 24 billion and for dividends paid to textron inc partially offset by capital contributions received in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement in 2009 the finance group used more cash for financing activities compared with 2008 primarily due to the repayment of debt and commercial paper in 2009 totaling 45 billion compared with 22 billion in 2008 the finance group’s financing outflows were partially offset by 17 billion in proceeds from the first quarter 2009 drawdown on its bank line of credit in 2008 proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt totaled 15 billion 

tfc borrowed funds from textron inc in 2010 and in 2009 with interest to pay down maturing debt as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 the outstanding balance due to textron inc for these borrowings was 315 million and 413 million respectively 

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below

 

our earnings adjusted for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and provision for losses were stronger in 2010 and totaled 945 million compared with similarly adjusted earnings in 2009 of 711 million these higher earnings were offset by a 350 million voluntary contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2010 we also used less cash for restructuring activities in 2010 compared with 2009 with cash payments of 72 million 144 million and 7 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities in 2010 and 2009 finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations totaled 22 billion in 2010 46 billion in 2009 and 111 billion in 2008 cash outflows for originations declined to 450 million in 2010 from 30 billion in 2009 and 109 billion in 2008 

financing cash flows in 2010 primarily consisted of the 12 billion repayment of textron inc’s bank line of credit and a 300 million payment made on the outstanding balance of the tfc’s bank line of credit in addition we made 22 billion in principal payments on our longterm debt in 2010 

in 2009 more cash was used for financing activities as we repaid 42 billion in maturing longterm debt including early debt extinguishments compared with 19 billion in 2008 this use was partially offset by the receipt of 30 billion from drawing on our lines of credit which was partially offset by a 16 billion decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009 compared with a 218 million increase in net commercial paper borrowings in 2008 we also made 412 million in payments to settle advances against our companyowned officer life insurance policies in 2009 while in 2008 we received 222 million in advances against these policies in addition we used more cash in 2008 for stock repurchases and dividend payments compared with 2009 as discussed in the “manufacturing group cash flows” section herein 

  

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below

 

in 2010 and 2009 captive finance receivable originations have decreased largely due to lower aircraft sales 

consolidated discontinued operations cash flows the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below 

 

in 2009 cash flows from investing activities primarily include approximately 280 million in aftertax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron partially offset by 69 million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid  power business in the fourth quarter of 2008 we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid  power business of approximately 479 million see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 

contractual obligations 

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 1 2011 as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid

 

  

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table in 2011 we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately 200 million and approximately 30 million in the retirement account plan based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2012 through 2015 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 100 million to 400 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2011 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january 1 2011 the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

finance group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our finance group as of january 1 2011 as well as an estimate of the year in which these obligations are expected to be paid 

 

 

on january 1 2011 the finance group also had 257 million in other liabilities primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 

finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management’s evaluation and analysis by product line for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired including large accounts in homogenous portfolios a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value to either a the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate or b the fair value if the finance receivable is collateral dependent the expected future cash flows consider collateral value financial performance and liquidity of our borrower

  

existence and strength of guarantors estimated recovery costs including legal expenses and costs associated with the repossessionforeclosure and eventual disposal of collateral when there is a range of potential outcomes we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence 

the evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral which may differ from actual results while our analysis is specific to each individual account certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line which are discussed in detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio for homogenous portfolios including the aviation and golf equipment product lines the allowance is established as a percentage of nonrecourse finance receivables which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience current delinquency and default trends collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends for nonhomogenous portfolios including the golf mortgage and timeshare product lines the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience industry trends and collateral values we classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2010 and 2009 net chargeoffs totaled 138 million and 115 million respectively compared with the provision for losses recorded during the periods of 143 million and 267 million respectively 

finance receivables 

finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors including but not limited to contractual duration type of collateral credit strength of the borrowers interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables on an ongoing basis these factors combined with our overall liquidation strategy determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our finance receivables a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables as a result of the significant influence of economic and liquidity conditions on our business plans and strategies and the rapid changes in these and other factors we utilize to determine which assets are classified as held for sale we currently believe the term “foreseeable future” represents a time period of six to nine months we also believe that unanticipated changes in both internal and external factors affecting our financial performance liquidity position or the value andor marketability of our finance receivables could result in a modification of this assessment

if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future until maturity or payoff the finance receivables are reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time conversely if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity these receivables would be designated as held for sale and a valuation allowance would be established at that time if necessary at january 1 2011 if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements see page 65 in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the financial assets and liabilities that currently are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 

finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value there are no active quoted market prices for our finance receivables the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return financing cost capital structure andor discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses payment rates and credit line utilization rates where available the assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures industries and collateral types therefore all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases

  

includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment using a twostep process in step 1 companies are required to estimate fair value of their reporting units which may be done using various methodologies including the income method using discounted cash flows if its estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined in step 2 of the goodwill impairment test in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess

fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit’s short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions current cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

based on our annual review the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the step 1 impairment test in the foreseeable future 

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually

to determine the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2010 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 826 compared with 858 in 2009 in 2010 and 2009 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 90 of our total pension assets was 850 and 875 respectively a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2010 would have resulted in approximately a 22 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed 

  

income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2010 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 620 compared with 661 in 2009 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 625 in 2010 compared with 657 for 2009 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2010 would have resulted in approximate a 25 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2010 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2010 medical rate of 8 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2020 and then remain at that level the 2010 prescription drug rate of 9 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2020 and then remain at that level see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required

income taxes 

deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix as necessary

our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at january 1 2011 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 591 million after considering interest rate exchange agreements and the treatment of 640 million of floatingrate loans with indexrate floors as fixedrate loans these loans have index rates that are on average 198 basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate the finance group has benefited from interest rate floor agreements in the recent lowrate environment however in a rising rate environment this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by 28 million 56 million and 25 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which our products are manufactured andor sold the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for 2010 and 2009 from the prior year for each period is provided below 

 

for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 06 billion and 10 billion at the end of 2010 and 2009 respectively 

quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts 

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates and a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar

finance segment 

our finance segment which is also the finance group consists of textron financial corporation tfc its subsidiaries and the securitization trusts consolidated into it along with two other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc our finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we announced a plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture we made the decision to exit this business in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of the disruption and instability in the capital markets the noncaptive business includes the following product lines assetbased lending distribution finance golf mortgage hotel structured capital and timeshare the exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales during 2009 we reduced our owned and managed finance receivable portfolio by approximately 38 billion and expect depending on market conditions to substantially complete liquidation of the remaining noncaptive portfolio over the next two to three years this reduction included approximately 450 million in finance receivables from our captive finance business 

our finance segment continues to originate new customer relationships and finance receivables in the captive finance division which provides financing for new cessna aircraft and bell helicopters and new ezgo and jacobsen golf and turfcare equipment financing continues to be provided to purchasers of used cessna aircraft and bell helicopters on a limited basis our finance segment’s services are offered primarily in north america however purchases of certain textron products principally bell helicopters and cessna aircraft are financed worldwide most financing for cessna aircraft sold to international buyers now is provided by using funding from the exportimport bank of the united states through a credit facility provided to a whollyowned finance subsidiary of textron and guaranteed by tfc

the commercial finance business has traditionally been extremely competitive our finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions including banks leasing companies commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price term structure and service 

our finance segment’s largest business risks are continued access to financing through the capital markets and the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio see “finance portfolio quality” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 26 and 27 for a discussion of the credit quality of this portfolio 

backlog 

our backlog at the end of 2009 and 2008 is summarized below 

 

the decrease in backlog at cessna reflects the cancellation of numerous business jet orders during the year and includes a 21 billion impact from our decision to cancel the development of the citation columbus aircraft and a 13 billion impact due to cancellations by one customer the economic recession has significantly impacted many of our customers resulting in a significant number of cessna’s customers requesting deferral of their scheduled delivery date transition to a smaller or less expensive model or in many cases cancellation of their order we continue to identify customers interested in accelerating their aircraft delivery date to replace deferrals or cancellations and expect ongoing volatility in the timing of fulfillment of our cessna backlog until economic conditions begin to recover 

orders from cessna customers which cover a wide spectrum of industries worldwide are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive purchase agreement and the initial customer deposit is received we work with our customers to provide estimated delivery dates which may be adjusted based on the customers’ needs or our production schedule but do not establish definitive delivery dates until approximately six months before expected delivery there is considerable uncertainty as to when or whether backlog will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity customer needs and credit availability these factors also may be impacted by the economy and public perceptions of private corporate jet usage while backlog is an indicator of future revenues we cannot reasonably estimate the year each order in backlog ultimately will result in revenues and cash flows 

orders remain in backlog until the aircraft is delivered or upon cancellation by the customer upon cancellation deposits are used to defray costs including remarketing fees cost to reconfigure the aircraft and other costs incurred as a result of the cancellation remaining deposits if any may be retained or refunded at our discretion 

approximately 64 of our total backlog at january 2 2010 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2010 and approximately 10 is attributable to the citation cj4 aircraft which we expect will first be delivered in 2010 

the us government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract the difference between the award value of the contract and the amount formally appropriated funded represents unfunded backlog which generally includes cost plus type contracts at january 2 2010 approximately 1 of our backlog with the us government was unfunded 

us government contracts 

in 2009 approximately 31 of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the us government this business is subject to competition changes in procurement policies and regulations the continuing availability of funding which is dependent upon congressional appropriations national and international priorities for defense spending world events and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate 

our contracts with the us government generally may be terminated by the us government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract if the us government terminates a contract for convenience we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination including if applicable reasonable profit on such work as well as reasonable termination costs if however the us government terminates a contract for default generally a we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted an agreedupon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property and for partially completed products accepted by the us government b the us government will not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract and c we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impact our business financial condition or results of operations perhaps materially 

decline in demand for our aircraft products cancellation of orders and delays in aircraft delivery schedules may continue to adversely affect our financial results 

the current weak economic environment has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our aircraft and a tightening of credit availability for potential purchasers of our aircraft as well as a substantial number of cancellations of orders and customer requests for delayed delivery of ordered aircraft weak economic conditions may continue to soften demand for new and used business jets and helicopters and may continue to adversely impact the pricing of new aircraft and the valuation of used aircraft difficult conditions in the financial markets may continue to adversely impact our customers’ ability to fund or finance purchases of our aircraft weakness in the economy may continue to result in fewer hours flown on existing aircraft and consequently lower demand for spare parts and maintenance we generally make sales of our commercial aircraft under purchase orders that are subject to cancellation modification or rescheduling aircraft customers including sellers of fractional share interests may continue to respond to weak economic conditions by canceling orders andor delaying delivery of orders in addition both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry they may impose new regulations with additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions including for example environmentalrelated restrictions andor fees that may adversely impact demand for business jets andor helicopters moreover a prolonged downturn in our markets may impact our decision to invest in the development of new products or improvements to existing products which could adversely impact our future competitiveness and profitability reduced demand for new and used aircraft spare parts and maintenance continued cancellations of orders andor delivery delays could significantly reduce our revenues profitability and cash flows 

we may not be able to continue to execute the liquidation of our finance segment’s noncaptive commercial finance business at a favorable pace and level of recovery 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we announced a plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture the exit plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to accomplish the orderly liquidation of our portfolio on a timely or successful basis or in a manner that will generate cash sufficient to service our finance segment’s debt we may encounter delays and difficulties in effecting the continued orderly liquidation of our various receivable portfolios as a result of many factors including the inability of our customers to find alternative financing which could expose us to increased credit losses we may have greater difficulty in selling the remaining receivables that have been designated for sale or transfer assets that have been acquired upon foreclosure of receivables andor other nonoperating assets at the pricing that we anticipate or in the time frame that we anticipate we may be required to make additional marktomarket or other adjustments against assets that we intend to sell or to take additional reserves against assets that we intend to retain we may change our current strategy based on either our performance and liquidity position or changes in external factors affecting the value andor marketability of our assets which could result in changes in the classification of assets we intend to hold for investment and additional marktomarket adjustments we may incur higher costs than anticipated as a result of this exit plan or be subject to claims made by third parties and the exit plan may result in increased credit losses we expect that our portfolio quality will continue to deteriorate as we proceed through the liquidation and the mix of assets changes and that our cash conversion ratio on liquidation will decrease this deterioration could be more severe and the cash conversion ratio lower than we anticipate resulting in substantial credit losses significant delay or difficulty in executing the continued liquidation andor substantial losses could result in the failure of our portfolio to generate the cash necessary to service our finance segment’s indebtedness resulting in continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

difficult conditions in the financial markets have adversely affected the business and results of operations of our finance segment and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other credit products in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality or geographic or industry concentrations as well as the ability of our customers to obtain alternative financing as our finance segment exits certain lines of business financial market conditions over the previous 18 months have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks these writedowns initially of mortgagebacked securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities have caused many financial institutions to seek additional 

capital to merge with larger and stronger institutions and in some cases to fail many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies and defaults lack of consumer confidence increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity valuations of the types of collateral securing our captive finance portfolio particularly valuations of used aircraft have decreased significantly and may continue to decrease if weak economic conditions continue declining collateral values could result in greater delinquencies and foreclosures as customers elect to discontinue payments on loan balances that exceed asset values our losses may increase if our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our finance receivable portfolio in particular declining collateral values in the portion of our captive finance portfolio secured by nontextron manufactured aircraft may result in increased losses as we may have greater difficulty liquidating these assets further deterioration of our finance segment’s ability to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem accounts may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition if these negative market conditions persist or worsen we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

if our finance segment’s estimates or assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain of its assets and its allowance for losses on finance receivables prove to be incorrect its cash flow profitability financial condition and business prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our finance segment uses estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of its assets including finance receivables heldforsale that do not have active quoted market prices our finance segment also uses estimates and assumptions in determining its allowance for losses on finance receivables and in determining the residual values of leased equipment and the value of repossessed assets and properties these estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to make and our finance segment’s actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions a material difference between our finance segment’s estimates and assumptions and its actual experience may adversely affect our finance segment’s cash flow profitability and financial condition 

payments required under our support agreement with textron financial corporation could restrict our use of capital 

under the terms of our support agreement with textron financial corporation during 2009 we made 270 million in cash payments to textron financial corporation to maintain both the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and the leverage ratio required by textron financial corporation’s credit facility these cash payments have been recorded as capital contributions to textron financial corporation we will likely be required to make additional capital contributions to textron financial corporation in the future in order to maintain these ratios while capital contributions to textron financial corporation may not increase the aggregate amount of outstanding consolidated indebtedness of textron and textron financial corporation such contributions could restrict our allocation of available capital for other purposes in addition recently from time to time textron financial corporation has borrowed from us to meet its liquidity needs and it may require further borrowings from us for its liquidity needs in the future depending upon market conditions textron financial corporation’s need for borrowings from us could restrict our use of funds for other purposes 

failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings acceptable to investors may increase the cost of our funding and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets 

the major rating agencies regularly evaluate us including textron financial corporation late in 2008 and during 2009 our long and shortterm credit ratings were subject to several downgrades resulting in the ratings disclosed on page 29 in the “credit ratings” section failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain financing as well as our access to the capital markets 

we may need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations in the future such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms if at all 

we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due this may include refinancing a portion of our credit facilities prior to april 2012 when the approximate 30 billion in aggregate borrowings thereunder becomes due although we currently believe we have access to the capital markets due to the unstable economy and the volatile credit market environment or other factors we may not be able to refinance our credit facilities or maturing debt at the time that such financing is necessary at terms that are acceptable to us or at all if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our ability to fund our captive financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets 

our finance segment’s ability to continue to offer customer financing for the products that we manufacture and the longterm viability and 

profitability of the captive finance business is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost this ability and cost in turn are dependent on our credit ratings and are subject to credit market volatility if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing or if we are unable to offer competitive customer financing it could negatively impact our manufacturing group’s ability to generate sales which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the soundness of our suppliers customers and business partners could affect our business and results of operations 

all of our segments are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners including automobile manufacturers and other industrial customers customers of our bell and cessna products home improvement retailers and original equipment manufacturers many of which have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the volatile conditions in the financial markets these conditions could result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers customers or business partners the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers or suppliers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

we have customer concentration with the us government 

during 2009 we derived approximately 31 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our us government revenues have continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions our ability to compete successfully for and retain us government business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for a us government program in which we provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program and could have a negative impact on our results of operations while the overall level of us defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons including increases in funding of operations in iraq and afghanistan and the us department of defense’s military transformation initiatives we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow or not be reduced significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced in accordance with contract terms by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts in addition on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in any such event our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as a us government contractor we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials in addition we are subject to audits by the defense contract audit agency to assure our compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to us government contractors a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time also changes in procurement policies budget considerations unexpected us developments such as terrorist attacks or similar political developments or events abroad that may change the us federal government’s national security defense posture may affect sales to government entities these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance estimates of award fees also are used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of these estimates it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial results of operations 

under fixedprice contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under costreimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements in our current and future markets and to develop and maintain competitive products and services delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft products and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through our research and development efforts furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products our failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our joint venture teaming and other arrangements involve risks and uncertainties 

we have entered and expect to continue to enter into joint venture teaming and other arrangements and these activities involve risks and uncertainties including the risk of the joint venture or related business partner failing to satisfy its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements 

we may make acquisitions and dispositions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions or dispositions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value acquisitions or dispositions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits with respect to acquisitions such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses with respect to dispositions the decision to dispose of a business or asset may result in a writedown of the related assets if the fair market value of the assets less costs of disposal is less than the book value in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at 

acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we also may underestimate the costs of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions or dispositions may divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances in addition we outsource certain support functions including certain global information technology infrastructure services to thirdparty service providers we depend on these vendors subcontractors and service providers to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations 

our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular product or service in particular in the aircraft industry most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft 

such events may adversely affect our financial results of operations or damage our reputation and relationships with our customers likewise any disruption of our information technology systems or other outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our financial results 

our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions in production that are beyond our control 

our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders in addition we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers and even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 5900 of our us employees or 24 of our total us employees are unionized and approximately 2500 of our nonus employees or 37 of our total nonus employees are represented by organized councils as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

in addition to our workforce the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

our international business is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

our international business exposes us to certain unique and potentially greater risks than our domestic business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices which may change from time to time including regulations relating to importexport control environmental health and safety investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks these international risks may be especially significant with respect to sales of aerospace and defense products we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements which could adversely impact our revenues profitability and cash flows additionally we are facing increasing competition in our international markets from foreign and multinational firms that may have certain advantages including for example cost advantages over us as a result our ability to compete successfully in those markets may be adversely affected which could negatively impact our revenues 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements it may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including i limitations on creation of liens on assets of textron inc or of its manufacturing subsidiaries ii maintenance of existence and properties and iii maintaining a maximum debt to capital ratio as defined and excluding our finance segment of 65 the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes also contain covenants including limitations on creation of liens on certain principal manufacturing facilities and shares of stock of subsidiaries that own such facilities and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions with respect to such facilities in addition both the credit facility and the indentures provide that consolidations mergers or sale of all or substantially all of our assets may only be effected if certain provisions are complied with some of these covenants may limit our ability to engage in certain financing structures create liens sell assets or effect a consolidation or merger 

our credit facility also contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than any of our subsidiaries that primarily are engaged in the business of a finance company of over 100 million similarly the supplemental indenture governing our convertible notes contains a crossdefault provision that would trigger an event of default thereunder if we fail to pay or otherwise have a continued default under other indebtedness of textron inc or any of our subsidiaries other than textron financial corporation or its subsidiaries of over 100 million therefore cessna finance export corporation a subsidiary of textron inc that is the borrower under the exim bank facility entered into on july 14 2009 would be included within the crossdefault provision of the supplemental indenture for the convertible notes although not within the similar provision in our credit facility as a result a failure to pay or a continued default under the exim bank facility if the outstanding balance thereunder exceeded 100 million could give rise to an event of default with respect to our convertible notes 

in addition a bankruptcy or monetary judgment in excess of 100 million against us or any of our subsidiaries that accounts for more than 5 of our consolidated revenues or our consolidated assets including our finance subsidiaries also would result in an event of default under our credit facility and a bankruptcy against us or any of our nonfinance “significant subsidiaries” within the meaning of the securities exchange commission’s rules also would result in an event of default under the indenture governing our convertible notes 

our failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility or the indentures or the failure of certain of our subsidiaries to comply with their debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated in some cases we are able to offset these reductions through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

in addition to reserves at our finance segment we establish reserves in our manufacturing segments to cover uncollectible accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns environmental remediation warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience andor current market conditions and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers as well as changing market conditions 

due to the nature of our business we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by climatic factors or by pilot or driver error in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible that such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable in addition we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where the contributions to those plans are driven by among other things our assumptions of the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth if the actual investment return and rates prove materially different from our assumptions this could adversely impact the amount of pension expense and require larger contributions to the plans also changing pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

textron believes that these lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously 

we are also subject to other actual and threatened legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business these proceedings include claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters some of these legal proceedings seek damages fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our suspension or debarment from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

the global economic recession in 2009 significantly impacted many of our businesses as consumers and businesses reduced spending and investment the lower demand resulting from this environment contributed to a decline in revenue of 35 billion to 105 billion and a decline in segment profit of 976 million to 475 million these declines were largely due to lower volume in the cessna and industrial segments the impact of lower volume was partially offset by improved cost performance as we aligned our workforce and production levels with demand through our restructuring program employee furloughs and temporary plant shutdowns revenue and segment profit also were adversely impacted by lower earnings and resulting operating losses in the finance segment largely due to an increase in portfolio losses lower market interest rates and lower securitization income 

since our restructuring program was initiated at the end of 2008 we have improved our cost structure by reducing our workforce by approximately 10400 employees representing approximately 24 of our workforce and by closing 23 leased and owned facilities and plants this program has contributed to significant cost improvements in most of our businesses 

during the year we continued to execute our plan to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture we reduced our managed finance receivables by 38 billion in 2009 through discounted payoffs portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization and had a cash conversion ratio of 94 this reduction included approximately 450 million in finance receivables from our captive finance business the finance segment’s onand offbalance sheet debt was reduced by an aggregate of 38 billion largely due to securitization payoffs and debt maturities we expect the finance segment to continue to contribute operating losses in 2010 as it liquidates the noncaptive portfolio 

our defense businesses continue to perform well reflecting strong program performance at textron systems revenues have been favorably impacted by higher volume largely due to higher shadow unmanned aircraft system and sensor fused weapon deliveries partially offset by lower aircraft engine volume as aircraft manufacturers cut production levels in response to lower market demand at bell higher military volumes from the v22 and other programs have been partially offset by the impact of the 2008 armed reconnaissance helicopter arh program cancellation and lower commercial helicopter deliveries 

backlog for our aircraft and defense businesses at the end of 2009 totaled 135 billion a 41 decline from the prior year primarily due to a 66 decrease in backlog at cessna the decline in backlog at cessna reflects the cancellation of numerous business jet orders largely due to the economic recession and includes a 21 billion impact from our decision to cancel the development of the citation columbus aircraft and a 13 billion impact due to cancellations by one customer we expect ongoing volatility in our backlog at cessna until economic conditions stabilize backlog increased in the bell segment largely related to the multiyear contract for the v22 

during 2009 we took several actions to ensure adequate liquidity and capital resources in light of the turmoil in the capital markets as summarized below 

 

we believe that with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the noncaptive business and the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 

results of operations 

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and cost performance volume represents changes in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit 

mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits or other costs cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation selling and administrative costs warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup rampup and cost reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs for the us government business performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catchup adjustments in the current period 

revenues 

revenues decreased 35 billion or 25 to 105 billion in 2009 compared with 2008 this decrease is primarily due to the following factors 

 

 

 

revenues increased 16 billion or 13 to 140 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 this increase is primarily due to the following factors in our manufacturing businesses which were partially offset by lower revenues of 152 million in the commercial finance business 

 

 

 

cost of sales 

cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was 835 796 and 790 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in 2009 is primarily due to the impact of lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns in the cessna and industrial segments resulting in increased conversion costs and idle capacity the increase in 2008 is largely due to higher product development costs primarily at cessna related to the development of new citation models and inventory writedowns taken at cessna at the end of 2008 largely related to preowned aircraft 

selling and administrative expense 

selling and administrative expense decreased 262 million to 1344 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to workforce reductions and furlough programs resulting in lower compensation and related costs lower sales commissions at cessna and a decline in professional service and travel costs due to cost reduction efforts in 2008 selling and administrative expense increased 61 million to 1606 million compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in commission expense from higher business jet sales and higher operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of aai in 2007 partially offset by lower compensation expense largely caused by stock depreciation 

special charges 

special charges include restructuring charges of 237 million and 64 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2009 special charges also includes a goodwill impairment charge of 80 million in the industrial segment which is discussed on page 67 of note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in 2008 we incurred other special charges of 462 million in the finance segment in connection with our decision to exit the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business these charges include the initial marktomarket adjustment of 293 million that was made when we classified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale and a goodwill impairment charge of 169 million there were no special charges in 2007 

special charges by segment are as follows 

 

restructuring program 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company which includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and streamlining of administrative overhead and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business this program was expanded in 2009 to include additional workforce reductions primarily at cessna corporate and bell the cancellation of the citation columbus development project the streamlining and reorganization of senior management and the consolidation of certain operations at cessna by the end of 2010 we expect to have eliminated approximately 10800 positions worldwide representing approximately 25 of our global workforce since the inception of the program as of january 2 2010 we have terminated approximately 10400 employees and have exited 23 leased and owned facilities and plants under this program 

we recorded net curtailment charges of 25 million for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the second quarter of 2009 as our analysis of the impact of workforce reductions on these plans indicated that curtailments had occurred and that the amounts could be reasonably estimated the curtailment charge for the pension plan is primarily due to the recognition of prior service costs that previously were being amortized over a period of years 

asset impairment charges included a 43 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2009 to write off assets related to the citation columbus development project due to the prevailing adverse market conditions and after analysis of the business jet market related to the product offering cessna formally canceled the citation columbus development project in the second quarter of 2009 cessna began this project in early 2008 for the development of an allnew widebodied eightpassenger business jet designed for international travel that would extend cessna’s product offering as its largest business jet to date this development project had capitalized costs related to tooling and a partially constructed manufacturing facility of which 43 million was considered not to be recoverable 

since the inception of the restructuring program we have incurred the following costs through january 2 2010 

 

we estimate that we will incur approximately 30 million in additional pretax restructuring costs in 2010 most of which will result in future cash outlays the additional costs are expected to primarily include relocation costs at cessna as it consolidates certain operations severance in the cessna segment and 3 million in severance for the finance segment we expect that the program will be substantially completed in 2010 however we expect to incur additional costs to exit the noncaptive portion of our commercial finance business over the next two to three years which are estimated to be within a range of 7 million to 17 million primarily attributable to severance and retention benefits 

interest expense 

interest expense includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups interest expense decreased 139 million to 309 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to reduced debt in the finance segment as it liquidates its noncaptive business interest expense net for the manufacturing group increased 18 million to 143 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to 38 million in interest on the convertible notes issued in the second quarter of 2009 partially offset by lower rates in 2009 due to our borrowings from our bank lines of credit interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit 

in 2008 interest expense decreased 59 million to 448 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the finance segment reflecting lower interest rates partially offset by higher average debt outstanding lower interest rates were primarily attributable to the decrease in market rate indices partially offset by an increase in borrowing spreads interest expense net for the manufacturing group increased 38 million to 125 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher borrowing costs associated with our commercial paper borrowings in 2008 

income taxes 

the following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate 

 

in 2009 the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the adoption for canadian tax purposes of the us dollar as the functional currency for one of our canadian subsidiaries a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to the recognition of a capital gain in connection with the sale of the cescom assets and a reduction in a valuation allowance related to contingent payments on a prior year transaction partially offset by a writeoff of nontax deductible goodwill in the industrial segment 

in 2008 the effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2008 to exit portions of the finance segment’s business this plan resulted in the impairment of all of the finance segment’s goodwill of which only a small portion was deductible for tax purposes in addition due to the change in the investment status of the finance segment’s canadian subsidiary we incurred 31 million in additional tax expense 

income from discontinued operations net of income taxes 

discontinued operations includes an 8 million gain on the sale of hr textron in 2009 and a 111 million gain on the sale of the fluid  power business in 2008 along with income loss from operations of these discontinued businesses prior to each disposition 

segment analysis 

we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments cessna bell textron systems industrial and finance segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 

cessna 

 

the deterioration in the global economy in 2009 significantly impacted the business jet market as evidenced by order cancellations and a decline in new aircraft orders in response to these conditions cessna reduced its aircraft production schedule to align output with customer demand and reduced its headcount by approximately 47 in 2009 see the “special charges” section regarding this restructuring program including cancellation of the citation columbus development program in the second quarter of 2009 

cessna revenues 

cessna’s revenues decreased 23 billion in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower volume in business jets and other aircraft reflecting the impact of fewer deliveries due to the economic recession we delivered 289 467 and 387 citation business jets in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively cessna’s spare parts product support and maintenance activities also experienced 152 million in lower volume largely due to a decline in aircraft utilization primarily as a result of the economic recession and citationair had lower volume of 79 million primarily due to lower demand we expect 2010 business jet volumes and margins will continue to be impacted by weakness in the general aviation industry 

the 96 billion decrease in backlog reflects the cancellation of numerous business jets orders largely due to the economic recession and included a 21 billion impact from our decision to cancel the development of the citation columbus aircraft and a 13 billion impact due to cancellations by one customer we expect ongoing volatility in our backlog until economic conditions begin to recover 

in 2008 cessna’s revenues increased 662 million compared with 2007 due to higher volume of 341 million higher pricing of 252 million and a benefit from a newly acquired business of 69 million 

cessna segment profit 

cessna’s segment profit decreased 707 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to an 883 million impact from lower sales volume and 48 million due to idle capacity related to lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns these decreases were partially offset by 131 million of favorable cost performance and a 50 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 on the sale of assets related to cescom which provided maintenance tracking services to cessna’s customers 

cessna’s favorable cost performance included 116 million in lower engineering selling and administrative expense largely due to the workforce reductions in 2009 and 82 million in forfeiture income from order cancellations partially offset by higher warranty expense of 35 million a 16 million increase in writedowns of preowned aircraft inventory reflecting lower fair market values due to an excess supply in the market and unfavorable performance at citationair of 10 million 

in 2008 cessna’s segment profit increased 40 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the impact of higher volume of 110 million pricing in excess of inflation of 82 million and favorable warranty performance of 14 million partially offset by increased engineering and product development expense of 45 million which included costs related to the development of new citation models cj4 and columbus inventory writedowns of 51 million largely related to used aircraft and increased overhead costs of 19 million 

bell 

 

bell revenues 

bell’s revenues increased 15 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to higher pricing of 94 million primarily related to certain commercial helicopters partially offset by lower volume of 79 million our volume decreased 97 million for commercial helicopters and 30 million for spares and support services largely due to a decline in demand along with a 76 million decrease related to the canceled arh program these decreases were partially offset by increased volume in other programs with the us government including an 80 million increase for the v22 as we delivered more aircraft under the multiyear program 

backlog at bell increased 711 million in 2009 primarily due to funding for the v22 program partially offset by a decline in commercial aircraft orders largely due to the economic recession 

in 2008 bell’s revenues increased 246 million compared with 2007 primarily due to higher volume of 134 million higher pricing of 87 million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of 26 million the increase in volume related primarily to higher v22 volume of 125 million largely due to delivery of 18 aircraft in 2008 compared with 14 in 2007 higher h1 volume of 47 million principally due to delivery of 12 aircraft in 2008 compared with 10 in 2007 and an increase in spares and service sales volume of 28 million these volume increases were partially offset by lower commercial helicopter volume of 54 million and lower arh program revenues of 19 million as a result of the program’s termination in october 2008 

bell segment profit 

bell’s segment profit increased 26 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to higher pricing in excess of inflation of 47 million and improved cost performance of 19 million partially offset by a change in product mix of 22 million primarily due to commercial helicopters and lower volume of 18 million the improved cost performance primarily reflects 

 

in 2008 bell’s segment profit increased 134 million compared with 2007 primarily due to favorable cost performance of 78 million higher pricing in excess of inflation of 32 million and 21 million in increased royalty revenues primarily related to the model a139 cost performance included 

 

arh program termination 

on october 16 2008 we received notification from the us department of defense that it would not certify the continuation of the arh program to congress under the nunnmccurdy act resulting in the termination of the program for the convenience of the government the arh program included a development phase covered by the system development and demonstration sdd contract and a production phase we submitted our claim for the termination costs for the sdd contract in october 2009 and believe that these costs are fully recoverable from the us government 

prior to termination of the program we obtained inventory and incurred vendor obligations for longlead time materials related to the anticipated lrip contracts to maintain the program schedule based on our belief that the lrip contracts would be awarded we have since terminated our vendor contracts and are negotiating to settle our termination obligations in october 2009 we filed a claim with the us government to request reimbursement of costs expended in support of the lrip program on december 17 2009 we received a decision from the contracting officer of the department of the army that denied this claim in its entirety we plan to appeal this decision in the first quarter of 2010 at january 2 2010 our reserves related to this program totaled 50 million which we believe are adequate to cover our exposure 

textron systems 

 

textron systems revenues 

revenues at textron systems increased 19 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to higher defense volumes including 83 million for shadow unmanned aircraft systems 45 million for sensor fused weapons and 34 million for armored security vehicles these increases were partially offset by lower aircraft engine volume of 73 million largely due to a decline in aircraft production as aircraft manufacturers cut production levels in response to lower demand lower armored security vehicle aftermarket volume of 45 million and a 33 million impact largely due to the completion of programs related to laser and missile technology development 

backlog at textron systems decreased 526 million in 2009 primarily due to deliveries on existing government contracts for shadow unmanned aircraft systems and armored security vehicles 

in 2008 textron systems revenues increased 766 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of aai in 2007 which contributed 701 million to revenues in 2008 and higher volume of 85 million partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a 28 million cost reimbursement in 2007 related to losses incurred during hurricane katrina the volume increase is primarily due to 69 million in higher volume in our armored security vehicle aftermarket products 48 million in higher volume for intelligent battlefield system products and 22 million in higher volume at lycoming partially offset by 32 million in lower sensor fused weapon volume 

textron systems segment profit 

segment profit at textron systems decreased 11 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the impact of lower aircraft engine volume of 38 million partially offset by a 29 million impact from higher defense volumes 

in 2008 textron systems segment profit increased 77 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of aai which contributed 62 million in 2008 and favorable cost performance of 12 million the favorable cost performance included 39 million related to the armored security vehicle program partially offset by the 2007 reimbursement of 28 million for the impact of losses incurred during hurricane katrina the armored security vehicle program cost performance is primarily due to improved labor efficiencies and lower material costs 

industrial 

 

industrial revenues 

revenues in the industrial segment decreased 840 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to 801 million in lower volume reflecting lower demand due to the economic recession and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 51 million largely due to fluctuations of the euro partially offset by 8 million in higher pricing 

in 2008 industrial segment revenues increased 93 million compared with 2007 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of 95 million higher pricing of 34 million and the favorable impact of an acquisition of 24 million partially offset by lower volume of 62 million volume declined in the kautex greenlee and jacobsen businesses as demand softened with the largest decline at kautex as the slowing economy had a significant impact on automotive sales in the second half of 2008 resulting in numerous factory shutdowns at automotive original equipment manufacturers around the world at ezgo volume increased 41 million largely due to increased fleet car sales related to the successful introduction of the rxv model 

industrial segment profit 

industrial segment profit decreased 40 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the 265 million impact from lower volume partially offset by improved cost performance of 211 million and lower inflation of 21 million cost performance has improved largely due to significant efforts made to reduce costs through workforce reductions employee furloughs temporary plant shutdowns and lower selling and administrative costs 

in 2008 industrial segment profit decreased 106 million compared with 2007 mainly due to inflation in excess of pricing of 61 million and the impact of lower volume and mix of 54 million partially offset by improved cost performance of 13 million 

finance 

 

during 2009 we proceeded with our plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business in our finance segment we made the decision to exit this business in the fourth quarter of 2008 in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of disruption and instability in the capital markets the plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected depending on market conditions to be substantially complete over the next two to three years the finance segment also announced a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to headcount reductions and asset impairments resulting from the exit plan see “special charges” section on pages 18 to 20 regarding charges taken as a result of the exit plan which are not reflected in segment profit 

finance revenues 

finance segment revenues decreased 362 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the following 

 

portfolio losses recognized in 2009 include discounts taken on the sale or early termination of finance assets including 60 million in discounts associated with the liquidation of distribution finance and golf mortgage finance receivables 53 million in impairment charges related to automobile manufacturing equipment and investments in real estate associated with matured leveraged leases and 25 million in higher impairment charges associated with repossessed aircraft 

in 2008 revenues in the finance segment decreased 152 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

finance segment profit loss 

the finance segment loss increased 244 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 157 million impact from higher portfolio losses 70 million in lower securitization gains net of impairments 37 million in higher suspended earnings on nonaccrual finance receivables and a 33 million increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by 55 million in gains on debt extinguishment 

in 2008 segment profit in the finance segment decreased 272 million compared with 2007 primarily due to a 201 million increase in the provision for loan losses a 51 million impact of higher borrowing costs relative to market rates 20 million in lower securitization gains net of impairments a 16 million lower gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment partially offset by a 24 million benefit from variablerate receivable interest rate floors 

we increased the allowance for loan losses significantly in 2009 and 2008 in response to the economic recession declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance business in the fourth quarter of 2008 which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio in 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the rate and severity of defaults resulting from the economic recession and due to declining aircraft values the increase was partially offset by a 73 million decrease in the provision for the distribution finance 

portfolio largely due to the liquidation of 68 of its managed finance receivables in 2009 in 2008 the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an 81 million increase in defaults in the marine and recreational vehicles distribution finance portfolios a 21 million increase for the resort finance portfolio a 19 million reserve established for one account in the golf mortgage finance portfolio and a 16 million reserve for one account in the assetbased lending portfolio 

borrowing costs increased relative to the target federal funds rate as credit market volatility significantly impacted the historical relationships between market indices the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate libor and the target federal funds rate and from increased borrowing spreads on issuances of commercial paper in comparison with 2007 these increases were partially offset by increased receivable pricing as a result of variablerate receivables with interest rate floors 

finance portfolio quality 

the following table reflects information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment finance receivables held for sale are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as a result finance receivables held for sale are not included in the credit performance statistics below 

 

our nonaccrual finance receivables include impaired finance receivables as well as accounts in homogeneous loan portfolios that are not considered to be impaired but are contractually delinquent by more than three months we believe that the percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables generally will remain high as we execute our liquidation plan under the current economic conditions the liquidation plan is also likely to result in a slower pace of liquidations for nonaccrual finance receivables 

the ratio of allowance for losses to nonaccrual finance receivables held for investment decreased primarily as a result of certain nonaccrual timeshare and aviation accounts for which specific reserves were either not established due to sufficient collateral values and other considerations or were established at a percentage of the outstanding balance based on the expectation of partial recovery this reflects our best estimate of loss based on a detailed review of our workout strategy and estimates of collateral value 

the increase in operating assets received in satisfaction of troubled finance receivables primarily reflects an increase in the number of golf courses for which ownership was transferred to us from the borrower in 2009 we intend to operate and improve the performance of these properties prior to their eventual disposition 

a summary of these finance receivables and the related allowance for losses by collateral type is as follows 

 

 

 the increase in nonaccrual finance receivables primarily is attributable to the lack of liquidity available to borrowers in the timeshare portfolio weaker general economic conditions and depressed aircraft values the increase in timeshare notes receivable includes one 203 million account of which 120 million is collateralized by notes receivable and 83 million is collateralized by several resort properties which are included in the resort constructioninventory line above 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments the finance group which is also the finance segment consists of textron financial corporation tfc its subsidiaries and the securitization trusts consolidated into it along with two other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below 

 

 

 27 

we believe that with our existing cash balances coupled with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the noncaptive portion of the commercial finance business and cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 

during 2009 we proceeded with our plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business in our finance segment we made the decision to exit this business in the fourth quarter of 2008 in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of disruption and instability in the capital markets the plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected depending on market conditions to be substantially complete over the next two to three years we reduced our managed finance receivables by 38 billion in 2009 through discounted payoffs portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization which included approximately 450 million in finance receivables from our captive finance business managed finance receivables include owned finance receivables that are recorded on our balance sheets and finance receivables sold in securitizations where we have retained credit risk to the extent of our subordinated interest which may or may not be recorded on our balance sheets the reduction in managed finance receivables was primarily driven by the accelerated pace of liquidations in the distribution finance product line distribution finance receivables typically have short duration associated with the sales pace of equipment dealer inventory and this natural liquidation pattern was accelerated by asset sales discounted payoff programs and the transfer of borrowers with revolving credit lines to new lenders 

we measure the progress of the exit plan in part based on the percentage of managed finance receivable and other finance asset reductions converted to cash in 2009 we had a cash conversion ratio of 94 we expect the cash conversion ratio to decline over the duration of our exit plan due to the change in mix from shorter term assets in the distribution finance and assetbased lending product lines to longer term assets in our timeshare golf mortgage and structured finance product lines and the existence of a higher concentration of nonaccrual finance receivables at the end of 2009 the exit plan applied to the remaining 41 billion of the finance segment’s noncaptive managed finance receivables portfolio in 2010 we expect a total reduction in managed finance receivables of approximately 16 billion net of originations which includes noncaptive finance receivables as well as captive finance receivables in connection with the liquidation of our managed finance receivables we have reduced our finance group’s on and offbalance sheet debt portfolio by an aggregate of 38 billion largely due to the payoff of the distribution finance and golf securitizations and debt maturities 

in february 2009 due to the unavailability of term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis we drew the available balance from our aggregate 30 billion in committed bank lines of credit amounts borrowed under the credit facilities are due in april 2012 a portion of the proceeds was used to repay our outstanding commercial paper these facilities historically have been in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only and at the end of 2008 there were no borrowings outstanding related to the manufacturing group’s 125 billion facility or the finance group’s 175 billion facility 

during 2009 the capital markets improved and we were able to successfully access these markets to strengthen our current and future liquidity profile we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities on may 5 2009 we issued 600 million of 450 convertible senior notes convertible notes under our registration statement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statement for more information on these convertible notes concurrently with the offering and sale of the convertible notes we also offered and sold to the public under our registration statement 23805000 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately 238 million to further lengthen the maturity profile of our indebtedness on september 14 2009 we issued 600 million of senior notes under our registration statement comprised of 350 million of 620 notes due 2015 and 250 million of 725 notes due 2019 

both borrowing groups extinguished through open market repurchases an aggregate of 745 million in outstanding debt securities prior to maturity during 2009 resulting in gains of 54 million also in 2009 both borrowing groups completed separate cash tender offers for up to a 650 million aggregate principal amount of five separate series of outstanding debt securities with maturity dates ranging from november 2009 to june 2012 in completing these tender offers we extinguished an aggregate of 587 million of outstanding debt securities with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2012 and recognized a loss of 1 million in 2009 

we also have pursued new funding sources and transfers of existing funding obligations to new financing providers in july 2009 we entered into a credit agreement with the exportimport bank of the united states that established a 500 million credit facility to provide funding to finance purchases of cessna and bell aircraft by nonus customers who take delivery of new aircraft by december 2010 during the second quarter we transferred the rights to financing programs with two large manufacturers of lawn and garden products in the distribution finance business which will reduce future originations similarly in early april we entered into a threeyear agreement with a financial service company that now provides financing to third parties for a portion of our sales of ezgo golf cars 

credit ratings 

the major rating agencies regularly evaluate both borrowing groups and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and factors outside our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally at the beginning of 2009 our credit ratings were downgraded and the rating agencies cited concerns about textron financial corporation including execution risks associated with our plan to exit portions of our commercial finance business and the need for textron inc to make capital contributions to textron financial corporation as well as lower expected earnings the increase in outstanding debt resulting from the borrowing under our bank lines of credit weak economic conditions and liquidity and funding constraints 

on february 2 2010 moody’s investors service affirmed its ratings of both borrowing groups and changed its rating outlook to stable from negative reflecting improved liquidity at textron inc and better than expected progress in the ongoing liquidation of tfc’s noncaptive assets the credit ratings and outlooks of the debtrating agencies at the date of this filing were as follows 

 

our current credit ratings may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain other financing and access the capital markets 

manufacturing group cash flows 

free cash flow is a measure generally used by investors analysts and management to gauge a company’s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of that necessary to be reinvested to sustain and grow the business our definition of manufacturing free cash flow uses net cash from operating activities of continuing operations and subtracts dividends received from the finance group and capital expenditures then adds back capital contributions provided under a support agreement with tfc as discussed below plus proceeds from the sale of plant property and equipment we believe that our manufacturing free cash flow calculation provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund operations this measure is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should be used in conjunction with gaap cash measures provided in our consolidated statement of cash flows our manufacturing free cash flow measure may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies as there is no definitive accounting standard on how the measure should be calculated 

a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities of continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows to manufacturing free cash flow is provided below 

 

our manufacturing group’s free cash flow improved by 62 million in 2009 compared with 2008 as lower capital expenditures of 299 million and working capital improvements offset lower earnings and an increase in cash paid for restructuring activities cash used for restructuring activities totaled 132 million in 2009 compared with 3 million in 2008 and none in 2007 in 2008 free cash flow decreased 284 million largely due to a higher investment in inventories related to increased production levels and inventory build at bell and cessna and a 168 million increase in capital expenditures in connection with the ramp up of production 

cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

 

cash flow from operating activities increased 331 million in 2009 compared with 2008 largely due to 562 million in lower capital contributions paid to the finance group net of dividends received and working capital improvements partially offset by lower earnings we used 48 million in working capital in 2009 compared with 434 million in 2008 largely related to significant inventory reductions in 2008 cash flow from operating activities decreased primarily due to a 625 million capital contribution made to the finance group 

investing cash flows in 2009 2008 and 2007 primarily include capital expenditures of 238 million 537 million and 369 million respectively the decrease in 2009 is largely due to a reduction in discretionary spending due to the economic recession in addition in 2008 and 2007 we paid 109 million and 11 billion respectively for acquisitions primarily related to aai 

financing activities provided more cash in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the draw of our 12 billion on bank lines of credit a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings net proceeds of 442 million from the issuance of the convertible notes net of hedge 333 million in cash from the issuance of our common stock and common stock warrants 595 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in dividends paid these increases in cash provided were partially offset by an 869 million decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009 compared with an 867 million increase in these borrowings in 2008 in addition we made 412 million in payments to settle advances against our companyowned officer life insurance policies in 2009 while in 2008 we received 222 million in advances against these policies 

we have not repurchased any of our common stock other than in connection with an executive compensation award since we suspended all share repurchase activity under our repurchase program in september 2008 under boardauthorized share repurchase programs we spent 533 million in 2008 and 304 million in 2007 for share repurchases representing approximately 12 million and 6 million shares of common stock respectively 

on february 25 2009 we announced that our board of directors had voted to reduce our quarterly dividend to 002 per share for the first quarter of 2009 in an effort to increase our liquidity in the longterm interest of our shareholders accordingly the annual dividend decreased to 008 in 2009 from 092 in 2008 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 21 million 284 million and 154 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2008 the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in four payments compared with three payments in 2007 

capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group 

under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc textron inc is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million due to a goodwill impairment charge of 169 million at tfc along with other charges resulting from the exit plan discussed above on december 29 2008 textron inc was required to make a cash payment to tfc which was reflected as a capital contribution to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and to maintain the leverage ratio required by its credit facility cash contributions paid to tfc and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 

 

an additional cash contribution of 75 million was made to tfc on january 12 2010 to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement 

due to the nature of these contributions we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

 

we generated cash from investing activities in the finance group as new finance receivable originations declined to 37 billion in 2009 from 119 billion in 2008 as we effected our exit plan for the noncaptive business finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations decreased to 54 billion in 2009 from 119 billion in 2008 in 2008 cash used in investing activities decreased from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections and sale proceeds largely related to our decision to exit the noncaptive business resulting in lower originations 

the finance group used more cash for financing activities in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the repayment of debt and commercial paper in 2009 totaling 45 billion compared with 22 billion in 2008 the finance group’s financing outflows were partially offset by 17 billion in proceeds from the first quarter 2009 drawdown on its bank lines of credit in 2008 proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt totaled 15 billion 

in 2009 and 2008 the manufacturing group agreed to lend the finance group with interest funds to pay down maturing debt as of january 2 2010 and january 3 2009 the outstanding balance due to the manufacturing group was 447 million and 133 million respectively 

the finance group received 270 million in capital contributions from the manufacturing group in 2009 compared with 625 million in 2008 to enable it to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement in addition the finance group paid 207 million more in dividends to the manufacturing group in 2009 compared with 2008 

more cash was used for financing activities in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in debt payments partially offset by the 2008 capital contribution received from the manufacturing group and lower proceeds from borrowings related to the reduction in managed receivable growth 

consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

 

consolidated cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to working capital improvements largely related to a reduction in inventory partially offset by lower earnings and an increase in cash used in connection with our restructuring program 

we received more cash from investing activities primarily due to the finance group’s exit plan which resulted in lower finance receivable originations in 2007 11 billion in cash was used for acquisitions primarily related to aai 

more cash was used for financing activities as we repaid 42 billion in maturing longterm debt including early debt extinguishments compared with 19 billion in 2008 this use was partially offset by the receipt of 30 billion from drawing on our lines of credit which was partially offset by a 16 billion decrease in commercial paper borrowings in 2009 compared with a 218 million increase in net commercial paper borrowings in 2008 we also used more cash in 2008 for stock repurchases and dividend payments compared with 2009 as discussed in the “manufacturing group cash flow” section in 2008 we received less cash from financing activities compared with 2007 primarily due to 663 million in lower proceeds from borrowings net of principal payments 

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

 

in 2009 captive finance receivable originations have decreased largely due to lower aircraft sales in addition in april 2009 we signed a threeyear agreement with a financial services company that now provides financing to third parties for a portion of our sales of ezgo golf cars we expect this agreement to reduce future finance receivable originations in this business 

consolidated discontinued operations cash flows 

the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below 

 

in 2009 cash flows from investing activities primarily include approximately 280 million in aftertax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron partially offset by 69 million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid  power business in the fourth quarter of 2008 we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid  power business of approximately 479 million in 2007 cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits from the fastening systems business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 

contractual obligations 

finance group 

due to the nature of finance companies we believe that it is meaningful to include contractual cash receipts that we expect to receive in the future the following table summarizes the finance group’s liquidity position including all managed finance receivables and both on and offbalance sheet funding sources as of january 2 2010 for the specified years 

 

 

 this liquidity profile is an indicator of the finance group’s ability to repay outstanding funding obligations assuming contractual collection of all finance receivables absent access to new sources of liquidity or origination of additional finance receivables in addition at january 2 2010 our finance group had 402 million in other liabilities primarily including accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

at january 2 2010 the finance group had 350 million of unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under revolving lines of credit construction loans and equipment loans and leases these commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and funding under these facilities is dependent on the availability of eligible collateral and compliance with customary financial covenants since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements we also have ongoing customer relationships including manufacturers and dealers in the distribution finance product line which do not contractually obligate us to provide funding however we may choose to fund under certain of these relationships to facilitate an orderly liquidation and mitigate credit losses neither of these potential fundings is included as contractual obligations in the table above 

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 2 2010 as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 

 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table since the future cash outflows are uncertain we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately 20 million in 2010 based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2011 through 2014 are estimated to be in the range of approximately 200 million to 400 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 2 2010 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes unrecognized tax benefits and product liability reserves have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january 2 2010 the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 

we evaluate our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment based on a combination of factors for homogeneous loan pools we examine current delinquencies the characteristics of the existing accounts historical loss experience the value of the underlying collateral general economic conditions and trends and the potential impact of the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers as a result of our current decision to exit our noncaptive finance business we estimate losses will range from 075 to 100 of finance receivables held for investment depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool for larger balance commercial loans we also consider borrowerspecific information industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 

provision for losses on finance receivables held for investment is charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment at a level considered adequate to cover losses inherent in the owned finance receivable held for investment portfolio based on management’s evaluation and analysis of this portfolio while management believes that its consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above does result in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment currently represents 549 of total finance receivables held for investment during the last five years net chargeoffs as a percentage of finance receivables held for investment have ranged from 038 to 182 

finance receivables held for sale 

finance receivables are classified as held for sale based on the determination that we no longer intend to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future until maturity or payoff or there no longer is the ability to hold to maturity our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors including but not limited to contractual duration type of collateral credit strength of the borrowers the existence of continued contractual commitments and the perceived marketability of the receivables on an ongoing basis these factors combined with our overall liquidation strategy determine which finance receivables we have the positive intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale 

our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value andor the marketability of our finance receivables a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables as a result of the significant influence of economic and liquidity conditions on our business plans and strategies and the rapid changes in these and other factors we utilize to determine which assets are classified as held for sale we currently believe the term “foreseeable future” represents a time period of six to nine months we also believe that unanticipated changes in both internal and external factors affecting our financial performance liquidity position or the value andor marketability of our finance receivables could result in a modification of this assessment if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future until maturity or payoff the finance receivables are reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time conversely if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity these receivables would be designated as held for sale and a valuation allowance would be established at that time if necessary at january 2 2010 if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements see page 68 in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the assets and liabilities that currently are not recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 

finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of transfer to the held for sale classification we establish a valuation allowance for any shortfall between the carrying value net of all deferred fees and costs and fair value upon the initial classification to held for sale any shortfall is recorded as a charge within special charges in addition any allowance for loan losses previously allocated to 

these finance receivables is reclassified to the valuation allowance account which is netted with finance receivables held for sale on the balance sheet after the valuation allowance is initially established it is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the fair value of the receivables below the carrying value with subsequent adjustments included in earnings within segment profit fair value changes can occur based on market interest rates market liquidity and changes in the credit quality of the borrower and value of underlying loan collateral 

there are no active quoted market prices for our finance receivables the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction which includes the sale of both pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return financing cost capital structure andor discount rate expectations of prospective purchasers combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses payment rates and credit line utilization rates where available the assumptions related to the expectations of prospective purchasers were compared with observable market inputs including bids from prospective purchasers and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models these inputs are rarely derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures industries and collateral types therefore all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants and the sale price that we may ultimately recover 

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the costtocost method which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the unitsofdelivery method which is used for production effort as appropriate under the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment using a twostep process in step 1 companies are required to estimate fair value of their reporting units which may be done using various methodologies including the income method using discounted cash flows if its estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value the reporting unit is not impaired and no further analysis is performed otherwise the amount of the impairment must be determined in step 2 of the goodwill impairment test in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit’s short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins and discount rates which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions current cost structure anticipated net cost reductions and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the longterm growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve we utilize a weightedaverage cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 

as further discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted in an impairment charge of 80 million in the golf  turf reporting unit the fair value of all the other reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any of these units might fail the step 1 impairment test in the foreseeable future 

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2009 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 858 compared with 866 in 2008 in 2009 and 2008 the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans which represent approximately 88 of our total pension assets was 875 a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return in 2009 would have resulted in a 22 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2009 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 661  compared with 599 in 2008 for our domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 657 in 2009 compared with 60 for 2008 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate in 2009 would have resulted in a 32 million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2009 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2009 medical rate of 7 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2019 and then remain at that level the 2009 prescription drug rate of 10 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2019 and then remain at that level see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

warranty liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls 

we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate 

we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying tax rates expected to be enacted for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in a valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss as appropriate in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate exposures we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixedrate exposures and adjust the mix as necessary sometimes by entering into interest rate exchange agreements based on our evaluation of internal and external factors the manufacturing group did not enter into any interest rate exchange agreements in 2009 and the difference between the rates received and the rates paid on interest exchange agreements did not have a material impact on interest expense in 2008 or 2007 

our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at january 2 2010 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 06 billion after considering interest rate exchange agreements and the treatment of 14 billion of floatingrate loans with indexrate floors as fixedrate loans these loans have index rates that are on average 219 basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate the finance group has benefited from interest rate floor agreements in the recent low rate environment however in a rising rate environment this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by 56 million in 2009 and by 25 million in 2008 and increased interest expense by 25 million in 2007 

foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which our products are manufactured andor sold the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for 2009 and 2008 from the prior year for each period is provided below 

 

for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currencydenominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 10 billion at the end of 2009 

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts for our common stock we historically have utilized forward contracts for our common stock to manage the expense related to our stockbased compensation awards on january 21 2010 we settled our forward contract and have elected not to enter into a new contract in 2010 

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a 10 decrease in the quoted market price of our common stock

on february 23 2010 the organization and compensation committee of the board of directors of textron inc approved the design of the annual and longterm incentive compensation program for 2010 with respect to textron inc’s executive officers including grant levels under these arrangements as well as the mix of grant type and the type of metrics to be used for performance goals for 2010 and for the 20102012 performance share unit cycle the committee also set applicable targets for the metrics used other than as described herein awards of stock options restricted stock units and performance share units operate on substantially the same terms as those granted in prior years

annual incentive compensation 

incentive payments to executive officers for 2010 under the textron inc shortterm incentive plan as amended and restated effective july 25 2007 will be based on the following







“cash efficiency” will be based i fifty percent 50 upon goals relating to net targeted finance receivable liquidations by textron financial corporation versus prescribed loss ratios and ii fifty percent 50 upon targets relating to manufacturing cash flow

target payouts for the named executive officers range from 65 to 120 of the executive’s base salary the amount actually paid generally can range from zero if the threshold level of actual performance relating to target performance objectives is not achieved to no more than twice the target award level payouts are made in cash following review and certification of performance results by the committee

longterm incentive compensation 

for 2010 awards under the textron inc 2007 longterm incentive plan amended and restated as of may 1 2007 as amended the mix of grant types will be redistributed such that 30 of the grant value for each executive officer will be awards in the form of stock options 30 in the form of restricted stock units and 40 in the form of performance share units

restricted stock units awarded in 2010 to executive officers will vest in equal installments over five years and will be settled in cash upon vesting these awards will also receive dividend equivalent payments on a quarterly basis prior to vesting

performance share units granted for the 20102012 cycle will be based 50 on achievement of earnings targets and 50 on cash efficiency targets the maximum payout on performance share units will be 150

failure to attain a minimum earnings performance level will result in the failure to earn any performance share units related to the earnings portion of the award with respect to the related year attainment between the minimum and maximum earnings goals will result in earning a portion of the performance share units related to the earnings portion of the award as defined by a preestablished mathematical formula the committee may determine an award less than that determined by the formula but may not determine an award more than that derived by the formula

the cash efficiency metric for the performance share units will work similarly to the earnings metric provided that no performance share units will be earned unless a minimum level of performance is achieved and a portion of the units will be earned if performance is between the minimum and maximum according to a mathematical formula

our finance segment’s largest business risks are continued access to financing through the capital markets and the collectibility of its finance receivable portfolio see “finance portfolio quality” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 27 for a discussion of the credit quality of this portfolio 

  backlog 

our backlog at the end of 2008 and 2007 is summarized below 

 

at january 3 2009 approximately 99 of the us government backlog was funded unfunded backlog represents the award value of us government contracts received generally related to costplus type contracts in excess of the funding formally appropriated by the us government the us government is obligated only up to the funded amount of the contract additional funding is appropriated as the contract progresses 

approximately 75 of our total backlog at january 3 2009 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2009 including 14 billion in orders for the new citation cj4 aircraft with first customer deliveries scheduled for 2010 and 23 billion in orders for the citation columbus aircraft which began development in 2008 and is not expected to provide significant revenues until the latter half of the next decade 

cessna’s backlog includes approximately 15 billion in orders from a major fractional jet customer orders from this fractional aircraft operator are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive master agreement and has established preliminary delivery dates for the aircraft delivery dates are subject to change through amendment to the master agreement orders from other cessna customers which cover a wide spectrum of industries worldwide are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive purchase order an initial customer deposit is required upon entering into a definitive purchase agreement with subsequent additional deposits at certain milestone dates orders remain in backlog until the aircraft is delivered or the customer requests cancellation upon cancellation deposits are used to defray costs including remarketing fees cost to reconfigure the aircraft and other costs incurred as a result of the cancellation remaining deposits if any may be refunded at our discretion 

the deepening recession and turmoil in the capital markets have significantly impacted many of our customers during the second half of 2008 as a result a significant number of cessna’s customers have requested deferral of their scheduled jet delivery date transition to a smaller or less expensive jet model or in some cases to cancel their order we also identified customers interested in accelerating their aircraft delivery date to replace deferrals or cancellations as a result we have lowered our planned jet production level for 2009 we expect ongoing volatility in the timing of fulfillment of our cessna backlog until economic conditions stabilize 

us government contracts 

in 2008 approximately 24 of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the us government this business is subject to competition changes in procurement policies and regulations the continuing availability of funding which is dependent upon congressional appropriations national and international priorities for defense spending world events and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate 

our contracts with the us government generally may be terminated by the us government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract if the us government terminates a contract for convenience we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination including if applicable reasonable profit on such work as well as reasonable termination costs if however the us government terminates a contract for default generally a we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted an agreedupon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property and for partially completed products accepted by the us government b the us government will not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and will be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impact our business financial condition or results of operations perhaps materially 

if the current economic uncertainty and capital market turbulence is prolonged our planned liquidity actions may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 

we have a significant amount of term debt that matures in early 2010 and we are reliant upon our planned liquidity actions to repay these obligations if our plans to maximize cash flow in our manufacturing businesses through realignment of production levels cost reduction activities and reduction of working capital and our plans to liquidate noncaptive finance receivables in our finance segment are not successful we may not generate enough cash to repay our obligations without obtaining additional financing we no longer have access to a backup credit facility and we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing on acceptable rates and terms if at all in such event we may need to take additional costcutting or other measures that could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

measures we are taking to enhance our liquidity position in our finance segment including our plan to exit portions of textron financial corporation’s commercial finance business may not work in the manner and within the timeframe that we anticipate or at all 

we have announced a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of our finance segment other than that portion of the business supporting the financing of customer purchases of textronmanufactured products the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish the orderly liquidation or selected sales on a timely or successful basis or in a manner that will enhance our liquidity position we may encounter delays and difficulties in effecting an orderly liquidation of our various receivable portfolios as a result of many factors including the inability of our customers to find alternative financing which could expose us to increased credit losses as well as existing contractual limitations we may not be able to accomplish sales of the receivables that have been designated for sale or transfer at the pricing that we anticipate or in the timeframe that we anticipate we may be required to make additional marktomarket or other adjustments against assets that we intend to sell or to take additional reserves against assets that we intend to retain we may change our current strategy based on either our performance and liquidity position or changes in external factors 

  affecting the value andor marketability of our assets which could result in changes in the classification of assets we intend to hold for investment and additional marktomarket adjustments we may incur higher costs than anticipated as a result of this exit plan or be subject to claims made by third parties and the exit plan may result in exacerbated credit losses moreover our withdrawal from these lines of business will reduce the income and cash flow that our finance segment generates in future years our failure to accomplish the exit plan successfully could result in continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

current levels of credit market volatility are unprecedented which may continue to disrupt our access including our finance group’s access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity may not be available 

due to unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the credit markets beginning in the second half of 2008 we have experienced difficulty in accessing our historical sources of financing at favorable rates and terms the continued deterioration of the credit markets has adversely impacted our liquidity this situation has been exacerbated by the recent downgrades of our credit ratings which have adversely impacted our ability to access the credit markets given the current economic environment and the risks associated with the capital markets in general including the current unavailability to us of public unsecured term debt and difficulty we had in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis on february 3 2009 we borrowed the entire available balance of the 30 billion committed bank credit lines available to textron and textron financial corporation however the additional liquidity provided by the bank line draw may not be sufficient to meet our needs and we may need to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital 

we are continuing to explore other potential avenues of liquidity including funding sources in the capital markets sales of other assets within our manufacturing group and new financing structures for the finance group however we may not be able to raise sufficient capital as and when required if the financial markets remain in turmoil and any capital we raise may be on terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders or otherwise unfavorable to us any sales of other assets that we may carry out may be completed on unfavorable terms or cause us to incur charges and we would lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery new financing structures may not be available on acceptable rates and terms if our business continues to experience significant challenges we may face other pressures such as employee retention issues and potential loss of suppliers or distributors for our products 

payments required under our support agreement with textron financial corporation could restrict our use of capital 

as a result of the decision to downsize textron financial corporation and the resulting accounting charges and adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 under the terms of our support agreement with textron financial corporation we made a cash payment of 625 million to textron financial corporation to maintain both the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and the leverage ratio required by textron financial corporation’s credit facility this cash payment was recorded as a capital contribution to textron financial corporation we may be required to make additional capital contributions to textron financial corporation in the future in order to maintain these ratios while capital contributions to textron financial corporation may not increase the aggregate amount of outstanding consolidated indebtedness of textron and textron financial corporation such contributions could restrict our allocation of available capital for other purposes in addition recently from time to time textron financial corporation has borrowed from us to meet its liquidity needs and it may require further borrowings from us for its liquidity needs in the future depending upon market conditions textron financial corporation’s need for borrowings from us could restrict our use of funds for other purposes 

our lowered credit ratings limit our access to the capital markets and increases the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

the major rating agencies regularly evaluate us including textron financial corporation both our long and shortterm credit ratings have recently been subject to downgrades to the ratings disclosed on page 32 in the “credit ratings” section in connection with these rating actions the rating agencies have cited concerns about the finance group including execution risks associated with our decision to exit the noncaptive finance businesses and the need for textron inc to make capital contributions to textron financial corporation as well as lowerthanexpected business and financial outlook for 2009 the increase in outstanding debt resulting from the drawdown on our credit facilities weak economic conditions and continued liquidity and funding constraints failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings that are acceptable to investors would prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets and may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain other financing as well as our access to the capital markets 

difficult conditions in the financial markets have adversely affected the business and results of operations of our finance segment and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans leases and other credit products in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may be adversely affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality or 

  geographic or industry concentrations the ability of our customers to obtain alternative financing as our finance segment exits certain lines of business as well as the recent deterioration of the financial markets current financial market conditions have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks these writedowns initially of mortgagebacked securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital to merge with larger and stronger institutions and in some cases to fail many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies and defaults lack of consumer confidence increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our finance receivable portfolio further deterioration of our finance segment’s ability to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem accounts may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition as these current market conditions persist or worsen we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

the soundness of our suppliers customers and business partners could affect our business and results of operations 

all of our segments are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers customers and business partners including automobile manufacturers and other industrial customers customers of our bell and cessna products home improvement retailers and original equipment manufacturers many of which may be adversely affected by the volatile conditions in the financial markets these conditions could result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers customers or business partners the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers or suppliers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us 

we have relationships with many financial institutions and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended including divestitures that may be subject to funding requirements on the part of the buyer which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we have customer concentration with the us government 

during 2008 we derived approximately 24 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our us government revenues have continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions our ability to compete successfully for and retain us government business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government programs primarily defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for a us government program in which we provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program and could have a negative impact on our results of operations while the overall level of us defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons including increases in funding of operations in iraq and afghanistan and the us department of defense’s military transformation initiatives we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow or not be reduced significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the timing of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced in accordance with contract terms by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts in addition on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a 

  subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor in any such event our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as a us government contractor we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance estimates of award fees also are used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of these estimates it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial results of operations 

under fixedprice contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under cost reimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

delays in aircraft delivery schedules cancellation of orders or decline in demand for our aircraft products may adversely affect our financial results 

aircraft customers including sellers of fractional share interests may respond to weak economic conditions by delaying delivery of orders or canceling orders weakness in the economy may result in fewer hours flown on existing aircraft and consequently lower demand for spare parts and maintenance weak economic conditions also may cause reduced demand for used business jets or helicopters including cancellation or deferral of existing orders we may accept used aircraft on tradein that would be subject to fluctuations in the fair market value of the aircraft while in inventory in addition both us and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry new regulations imposing additional regulatory aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions may adversely impact demand for business jets andor helicopters reduced demand for new and used aircraft spare parts and maintenance can have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft products and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

  our joint venture teaming and other arrangements involve risks and uncertainties 

we have entered and expect to continue to enter into joint venture teaming and other arrangements and these activities involve risks and uncertainties including the risk of the joint venture or related business partner failing to satisfy its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements 

we may make acquisitions and dispositions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions or dispositions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value acquisitions or dispositions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits with respect to acquisitions such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses with respect to dispositions the decision to dispose of a business or asset may result in a writedown of the related assets if the fair market value of the assets less costs of disposal is less than the book value in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may also underestimate the costs of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions or dispositions may divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control 

our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders in addition we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers and even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 9400 of our employees or 22 of our total employees are unionized as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

in addition to our workforce the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

our international business is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

our international business exposes us to certain unique and potentially greater risks than our domestic business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability patent and trademark infringement employment disputes and environmental safety and health matters under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and 

  claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

in addition to reserves at our finance segment we establish reserves in our manufacturing segments to cover uncollectible accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers 

in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable the effect of these matters on our financial results depends in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering potential losses at reasonable rates 

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated in some cases we are able to offset these reductions through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner such events may adversely affect our financial results of operations or damage our reputation and relationships with our customers the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular product or service 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our defined benefit pension plans where the contributions to those plans are driven by among other things our assumptions of the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used for future payment obligations and the rates of future cost growth if the actual investment return and rates prove materially different from our assumptions this could adversely impact the amount of pension expense and require larger contributions to the plans also changing pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various nonus jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview 

revenues increased 13 to 142 billion while segment profit decreased 7 to 15 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 the revenue increase was largely due to the acquisition of aai corporation aai higher volume in our aerospace and defense businesses and pricing the decrease in segment profit was largely due to higher loan loss provisions in the commercial finance business partially offset by the impact of the higher volume and pricing see pages 18 through 27 for more discussion of these changes on a consolidated basis and by segment 

during the second half of the year turmoil in the capital markets and the deepening recession significantly impacted many of our businesses on december 22 2008 we announced our current plan to exit the noncaptive commercial finance business in the finance segment we also announced a restructuring program designed to reduce costs across the company this program together with other volumerelated reductions in workforce announced through january 2009 will eliminate approximately 15 of our workforce worldwide as a result of the exit plan and the restructuring program we incurred special charges totaling 526 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 these charges included a 293 million charge to marktomarket finance receivables now designated as held for sale a 169 million impairment charge to write off all of the finance segment’s goodwill and 64 million in restructuring charges see page 19 for a discussion of these special charges 

earnings per share from continuing operations decreased largely due to the special charges and a 31 million tax charge related to the change in investment status of a canadian subsidiary in the finance segment which had a combined impact of 179 per share and lower segment profit largely reflecting an increase in loan loss provisions at our finance segment 

backlog at the end of 2008 totaled 233 billion a 23 increase from the prior year bell’s backlog increased 24 billion in 2008 largely due to the v22 multiyear contract and cessna’s backlog increased 19 billion largely due to orders received for the widebody longrange citation columbus jet at cessna while generally only firm aircraft orders for which we have received deposits are included in backlog we have experienced deferrals that delay the delivery of commercial aircraft to later years as well as cancellations of orders within backlog see the “backlog” section on page 5 for more information for 2009 we have lowered our planned jet production level based on our current estimates we expect ongoing volatility in the timing of fulfillment of our cessna backlog until economic conditions stabilize 

our industrial segment saw volume decline in most of its businesses as demand softened with the largest decline at kautex reflecting numerous automotive original equipment manufacturers oem factory shutdowns around the world volume at ezgo increased largely due to increased fleet car sales related to the successful introduction of our new rxv model 

our defense businesses have buffered some of the impact of the economy through programs with the us government at textron systems revenues increased largely due to the acquisition of aai and continued demand for armored security vehicles asv and other products while bell experienced the loss of the armed reconnaissance helicopter arh program in the fourth quarter of 2008 bell’s v22 and h1 programs are performing as expected we shipped four more v22 aircraft and two more h1 aircraft in 2008 compared with 2007 

due to the current economic environment we have experienced higher borrowing cost and at times limited access to the capital markets in february 2009 we drew down on the balance of our 30 billion committed bank lines of credit to pay off our outstanding commercial paper and to provide us with additional liquidity during these uncertain times see the “recent developments” section on pages 28 and 29 for a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources 

  consolidated results of operations 

in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group changes in revenue and segment profit are typically expressed in terms of volume pricing foreign exchange and acquisitions additionally changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix inflation and costperformance volume represents changes in the number of units delivered or services provided pricing represents changes in unit pricing foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreigndenominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months for segment profit mix represents a change due to the composition of products andor services sold at different profit margins inflation represents higher material wages benefits or other costs cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development depreciation warranty product liability qualityscrap labor efficiency overhead product line profitability startup rampup and cost reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs for us government business performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catchup adjustments in the current period 

revenues 

revenues increased 16 billion or 13 to 142 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 this increase is primarily due to the following factors in our manufacturing businesses which were partially offset by lower revenues in the commercial finance business of 152 million 

 

 

 

revenues increased 16 billion or 15 to 126 billion in 2007 compared with 2006 the primary reasons for this increase are 

 

 

 

segment profit 

segment profit decreased 116 million or 7 to 15 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 this decrease is primarily due to 272 million in reduced profits in the finance segment largely due to an increase in the provision for loan losses of 201 million partially offset by the following factors 

 

 

 

  segment profit increased 342 million or 27 to 16 billion in 2007 compared with 2006 this increase is primarily due to the following factors which were partially offset by inflation of 240 million 

 

special charges 

special charges for the year ended january 3 2009 include an initial marktomarket adjustment of 293 million that was made when we reclassified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale a goodwill impairment charge in the finance segment of 169 million and restructuring charges of 64 million there were no special charges in fiscal 2007 or 2006 

as a result of the volatility and disruption in the credit markets and in order to reduce our reliance on shortterm funding on october 13 2008 our board of directors approved the recommendation of management to downsize the finance segment the plan approved at that time entailed exiting the finance group’s assetbased lending and structured capital businesses as well as several additional product lines and limiting new originations in the distribution finance golf finance and resort finance businesses on december 22 2008 our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textronmanufactured products we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets in total these actions will impact approximately 73 billion of the finance segment’s 108 billion managed receivable portfolio as of the end of 2008 the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years we recorded a pretax marktomarket adjustment of 293 million against owned receivables held for sale due to the exit plan at january 3 2009 approximately 29 billion of the liquidating receivables were designated for sale or transfer of which about 12 billion represent securitized receivables managed by the finance segment and 17 billion represent owned receivables classified as held for sale 

based on current market conditions and the plan to downsize the finance segment we recorded a 169 million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 to eliminate all goodwill at the finance segment 

in october 2008 we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead cost and improve productivity across the company on december 22 2008 the textron board of directors approved an expansion of this previously announced plan which includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and streamlining of administrative overhead the program along with other volumerelated reductions in workforce during the fourth quarter of 2008 and in january 2009 eliminates approximately 6300 positions worldwide representing approximately 15 of our global workforce 

we recorded pretax restructuring costs of 64 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to this restructuring program and the finance segment exit plan excluding volumerelated direct labor reductions which are recorded in segment profit in the first half of 2009 we estimate that we will incur an additional 40 million in pretax restructuring costs largely related to workforce reductions at cessna we may have additional restructuring costs as a result of further headcount reductions and other actions however an estimate of additional charges cannot be made at this time 

  special charges by segment for the year ended january 3 2009 are as follows 

 

corporate expenses and other net 

corporate expenses and other net decreased 86 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower compensation expenses largely caused by stock depreciation 

corporate expenses and other net increased 50 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to 26 million of higher compensation expenses largely related to stock appreciation 14 million of higher professional and consulting fees for corporate initiatives 11 million of increased costs for divested operations primarily due to higher pension costs and other retained liabilities and a 6 million increase in our contribution to the textron charitable trust partially offset by an 8 million gain on an insurance settlement 

interest expense 

interest expense for the manufacturing group increased 38 million to 125 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher borrowing costs associated with our commercial paper borrowing in 2008 

income taxes 

the following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate 

 

in 2008 the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2008 to exit portions of the finance segment’s business this plan resulted in the impairment of all of the finance segment’s goodwill of which only a small portion was deductible for tax purposes in addition due to the change in the investment status of the finance segment’s canadian subsidiary we incurred 31 million in additional tax expense 

discontinued operations 

in november 2008 we completed the sale of our fluid  power business unit to clyde blowers limited a ukbased worldwide leader in the areas of power materials handling intermodal transport and logistics and pump technologies this sale included our gear technologies hydraulics maag pump and union pump product lines along with each of their respective brands we received approximately 527 million in cash a sixyear note with a face value of 28 million and up to 50 million based on final 2008 operating results that will be determined by the 

  end of the first quarter of 2009 which will be primarily payable in a sixyear note we recorded an aftertax gain of 111 million for this sale after taxes and other dealrelated expenses are paid we expect total net aftertax proceeds for the sale to be approximately 380 million excluding any payments due to us related to the 2008 operating results 

in august 2006 we completed the sale of our fastening systems business to platinum equity a private equity investment firm for approximately 613 million in cash and the assumption of 16 million of net indebtedness and certain liabilities there was no gain or loss recorded upon completion of the sale prior to the consummation of the sale of the fastening systems business we recorded an impairment charge of 120 million in 2006 to record the business at the estimated fair value less cost to sell 

the fluid  power and fastening systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements the results of the fluid  power business were previously reported in the industrial segment 

revenue results of operations and gains on disposal for our discontinued businesses are as follows 

 

segment analysis 

effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008 we operate in and report financial information for the following five business segments cessna bell textron systems industrial and finance prior to 2008 we reported segment financial results within four segments bell cessna industrial and finance we changed our segment reporting to separate textron systems into a new segment initially named “defense  intelligence” and to report bell helicopter as its own segment bell to reflect the manner in which we now manage these businesses all periods presented herein have been recast to reflect the 2008 segment reporting structure 

segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 

cessna 

 

cessna revenues 

cessna’s revenues increased 662 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to higher volume of 341 million higher pricing of 252 million and a benefit from a newly acquired business of 69 million the higher volume primarily reflects higher jet and caravan deliveries of 481 million partially offset by lower used aircraft sales of 98 million and lower single engine sales of 56 million citation business jets are the largest component of cessna’s revenues we delivered 467 387 and 307 citation business jets in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively however we do not expect the level of revenue growth we have experienced over the last three years to continue in the near future due to recent deferrals 

  from 2009 deliveries and cancellations as discussed in the backlog section on page 5 cessna has reduced its 2009 production plan from 2008 levels as a result of reduced production levels cessna announced reductions in workforce by approximately 750 employees in the fourth quarter of 2008 and an additional 4100 employees in january 2009 

cessna’s backlog increased 19 billion primarily due to 23 billion in orders received for the widebody longrange citation columbus jet which began a multiyear development period in 2008 

in 2007 cessna’s revenues increased 844 million compared with 2006 due to higher volume of 631 million primarily due to higher citation business jet deliveries and improved pricing of 212 million 

cessna segment profit 

cessna’s segment profit increased 40 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the impact of higher volume of 110 million pricing in excess of inflation of 82 million and favorable warranty performance of 14 million partially offset by increased engineering and product development expense of 45 million which includes costs related to the development of new citation models cj4 and columbus inventory writedowns of 51 million largely related to used aircraft and increased overhead costs of 19 million favorable warranty performance is primarily related to lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2008 segment profit also includes other favorable warranty performance of 28 million in both 2008 and 2007 

in 2007 cessna’s segment profit increased 220 million compared with 2006 primarily due to improved pricing of 212 million along with the 139 million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of 14 million partially offset by inflation of 106 million and increased engineering and product development expense of 41 million favorable warranty performance included the 19 million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2007 related to initial model launches as discussed below partially offset by a lower benefit of 5 million from other favorable warranty performance a 28 million benefit in 2007 compared with 33 million in 2006 

during initial model launches cessna typically incurs higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs generally moderate for the sovereign and cj3 models production lines had reached this maturity level based on historical production and warranty patterns resulting in lower estimated warranty costs than earlier production aircraft accordingly cessna has had favorable warranty performance in the past three years primarily due to the lower pointofsale warranty costs for sovereign and cj3 aircraft sold 

bell 

 

bell revenues 

bell’s revenues increased 246 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher volume of 134 million higher pricing of 87 million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of 26 million the increase in volume relates primarily to higher v22 volume of 125 million largely due to delivery of 18 aircraft in 2008 compared with 14 in 2007 higher h1 volume of 47 million principally due to delivery of 12 aircraft in 2008 compared with 10 in 2007 and an increase in spares and service sales volume of 28 million these volume increases were partially offset by lower commercial helicopter volume of 54 million and lower arh program revenues of 19 million as a result of the program’s termination in october 2008 

backlog at bell increased 24 billion in 2008 largely due to funding under the v22 multiyear contract approved in march 2008 

bell’s revenues increased 234 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to higher volume and mix of 141 million and higher pricing of 90 million the increase in volume relates primarily to an increase in h1 program revenues of 161 million principally due to delivery of the first 10 production units an increase in v22 program revenues of 70 million primarily due to higher spares revenues and higher commercial helicopter deliveries of 50 million these increases were partially offset by 92 million in lower spares and service sales for aircraft other than the v22 and 44 million in lower huey ii kit deliveries 

  bell segment profit 

bell’s segment profit increased 134 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to favorable cost performance of 78 million higher pricing in excess of inflation of 32 million and 21 million in increased royalty revenues primarily related to the model a139 cost performance includes 

 

favorable cost performance in 2008 was partially offset by 20 million in increased selling and administrative expenses due to higher projectrelated consulting expenses and 14 million in increased research and development expense 

bell’s segment profit increased 36 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to higher pricing of 90 million and lower engineering research and development expense of 16 million partially offset by inflation of 48 million and the net impact of an unfavorable product mix of 17 million cost performance had only a moderate impact on profit but was impacted by the following significant items 

 

arh program termination 

on october 16 2008 we received notification from the us department of defense that it would not certify the continuation of the arh program to congress under the nunnmccurdy act resulting in the termination of the program for the convenience of the government the arh program included a development phase covered by the sdd contract and a production phase we are in the process of establishing the termination costs for the sdd contract which we believe will be fully recoverable from the us government 

prior to termination of the program we obtained inventory and incurred vendor obligations for longlead time materials related to the anticipated lrip contracts to maintain the program schedule based on our belief that the lrip contracts would be awarded we have since terminated these vendor contracts and have initiated negotiations to settle our termination obligations which we estimate may cost up to approximately 80 million we continue to evaluate the utility of the related inventory to other bell programs customers or vendors this review and the related discussions with vendors are ongoing we estimate that our potential loss resulting from our lriprelated vendor obligations will be between approximately 50 million and 80 million at january 3 2009 our reserves related to this program totaled 50 million we intend to provide a termination proposal to the us government to request reimbursement of costs expended in support of the lrip program 

in 2007 we incurred net charges of 32 million related to this program in the first quarter of 2007 we received correspondence from the us government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed into the production phase of the arh program accordingly we provided for losses of 18 million in supplier obligations for longlead component production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated arh lrip contract awards to maintain the program schedule in the second quarter of 2007 the us army agreed to replan the arh program and we reached a nonbinding memorandum of understanding related to aircraft specifications pricing methodology and delivery schedules for initial lrip aircraft we also agreed to conduct additional sdd activities on a funded basis based on the plan at that time and our related estimates of aircraft production costs including costs related to risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions we expected to lose approximately 73 million on the production of the proposed initial lrip aircraft accordingly an additional charge of 55 million was taken for estimated lrip contract losses in the third quarter of 2007 we reached an agreement with our customer under which we recovered 18 million of sdd launchrelated costs previously written off and in december 2007 we agreed to expand the scope of the development contract efforts 

  on a funded basis based on the status of our negotiations with the us government and our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the anticipated production units at that time we revised our best estimate of the expected loss to 50 million resulting in a 23 million reduction of previously established reserves 

in 2006 we expensed 14 million in unreimbursed costs we incurred in the development phase of the program as costs exceeded the original contract amount for this program 

h1 program 

segment profit includes charges related to the h1 program of 39 million in 2007 and 82 million in 2006 in 2006 this program was still in the development phase while we were concurrently working on the initial production aircraft under firm fixedprice lrip contracts with the us government in 2006 we recorded 82 million in charges based on our estimate that the costs to complete these lrip contracts would exceed contractual reimbursement due to higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements higher anticipated efforts in final assembly delayed acceptance of the initial aircraft by the us government due to changes in the development and engineering requirements identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing rework of inprocess units and resulting inefficiencies and a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements 

during 2007 we completed delivery of all the lot 1 aircraft as well as the first lot 2 aircraft our manufacturing performance during the year was substantially consistent with our expectations however we anticipated a cost increase primarily due to anticipated delays in receiving cabins from a supplier additionally during the fourth quarter we committed to higher pricing levels on an anticipated lot 5 contract that we estimated would likely result in a loss once contract negotiations were finalized primarily due to higher cabin supplier costs accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a net charge of 30 million to reflect the higher cost estimates for existing contract completion resulting from supplier delays as well as the estimated loss resulting from our price commitment on the lot 5 contract 

during 2008 our production efficiencies improved resulting in 6 million of favorable cost performance we delivered all remaining lot 2 aircraft during the year and expect to deliver the final lot 3 aircraft in february 2009 we also completed contract negotiations with the us government on lot 5 consistent with our prior expectations 

textron systems 

 

textron systems revenues 

revenues at textron systems increased 782 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of aai in 2007 which contributed 701 million to revenues in 2008 and higher volume of 101 million partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the 28 million cost reimbursement in 2007 related to losses incurred during hurricane katrina the volume increase is primarily due to 69 million in higher volume in our asv aftermarket products 48 million in higher volume for ibs products and 22 million in higher volume at lycoming partially offset by 32 million in lower sensor fused weapons sfw volume 

revenues at textron systems increased 273 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to newly acquired businesses which contributed 163 million higher volume of 93 million and 21 million in higher reimbursement of costs related to hurricane katrina the volume increase is primarily due to 78 million in higher asv revenues due to a 21  increase in deliveries to 576 units in 2007 56 million in higher revenues for ibs and a 16 million increase from sfw deliveries these increases were partially offset by lower joint direct attack munitions volume of 63 million 

textron systems segment profit 

segment profit at textron systems increased 88 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of aai which contributed 62 million in 2008 and favorable cost performance of 23 million the favorable cost performance includes 39 million related to the asv program partially offset by the 2007 reimbursement of 28 million for the impact of losses incurred during hurricane katrina the asv cost performance is primarily due to improved labor efficiencies and lower material costs 

  segment profit at textron systems increased 50 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to improved cost performance of 61 million and 22 million in profit contributions from acquisitions partially offset by the net unfavorable impact from inflation and pricing of 23 million the favorable cost performance includes 21 million of asv improvements resulting from increased productivity and lower indirect costs and the favorable impact from a hurricane katrina cost reimbursement of 21 million 

industrial 

 

industrial revenues 

revenues in the industrial segment increased 93 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of 95 million higher pricing of 34 million and the favorable impact of an acquisition of 24 million partially offset by lower volume of 62 million volume declined in the kautex greenlee and jacobsen businesses as demand softened with the largest decline at kautex as the slowing economy had a significant impact on automotive sales in the second half of 2008 resulting in numerous automotive oem factory shutdowns around the world at ezgo volume increased 41 million largely due to increased fleet car sales related to the successful introduction of the rxv model in response to significant decline in anticipated volume throughout all of industrial we have reduced production plans for 2009 and announced in the fourth quarter of 2008 planned headcount reductions of approximately 600 employees 

revenues in the industrial segment increased 214 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the favorable foreign exchange impact of 115 million higher volume of 112 million and higher pricing of 22 million partially offset by the 2006 divestiture of noncore product lines of 37 million 

industrial segment profit 

segment profit in the industrial segment decreased 106 million in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to inflation in excess of pricing of 61 million the impact of lower volume and mix of 54 million partially offset by improved cost performance of 13 million 

industrial segment profit increased 24 million in 2007 compared with 2006 mainly due to improved cost performance of 48 million higher pricing of 22 million and the 17 million impact of higher volume and mix partially offset by inflation of 66 million improved cost performance was primarily attributable to cost reduction efforts at kautex while inflation largely reflects increases in material costs 

finance 

 

on december 22 2008 our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textronmanufactured products we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and to address our longterm liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets in total these actions will impact approximately 73 billion of the finance segment’s 108 billion managed receivable portfolio the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years the finance group also announced a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to headcount reductions and asset impairments resulting from the exit plan see “special charges” section on page 19 regarding charges taken as a result of the exit plan which are not reflected in segment profit 

  finance revenues 

revenues in the finance segment decreased 152 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

these decreases were partially offset by the 24 million benefit from variablerate receivable interest rate floors and a 21 million impact from higher average finance receivables of 258 million 

revenues in the finance segment increased 77 million in 2007 compared with 2006 our revenue growth was primarily attributed to the following factors 

 

these increases were partially offset by a 17 million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures 13 million in lower leveraged lease earnings due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments and an 8 million reduction in leveraged lease earnings from the adoption of fsp no 132 “accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction” in 2007 

finance segment profit 

segment profit in the finance segment decreased 272 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a 201 million increase in the provision for loan losses a 51 million impact of higher borrowing costs relative to market rates 20 million in lower securitization gains net of impairments a 16 million lower gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment partially offset by a 24 million benefit from variablerate receivable interest rate floors 

we increased the allowance for loan losses significantly during 2008 in response to weakening general market conditions declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance businesses in the fourth quarter which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio the increases in provision for loan losses were primarily a result of an 81 million increase in defaults in the marine and recreational vehicles distribution finance portfolios a 21 million increase for the resort finance portfolio a 19 million reserve established for one account in the golf finance portfolio and a 16 million reserve for one account in the assetbased lending portfolio 

borrowing costs increased relative to the target federal funds rate as credit market volatility significantly impacted the historical relationships between market indices the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate libor and the target federal funds rate and from increased borrowing spreads on issuances of commercial paper in comparison with 2007 these increases were partially offset by increased receivable pricing as a result of variablerate receivables with interest rate floors 

segment profit in the finance segment increased 12 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to a 30 million increase in net interest margin partially offset by an 11 million increase in selling and administrative expenses largely attributable to finance receivable portfolio growth and a 7 million increase in provision for loan losses reflecting an increase in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs in the distribution finance portfolio net interest margin increased due to a number of factors including the following 

 

  finance portfolio quality 

the following table presents information about the finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment finance receivables held for sale are reflected at fair value in 2008 and are not included in the credit performance statistics below in 2007 and 2006 all of our finance receivables were held for investment and are reflected in the performance statistics provided below 

 

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our manufacturing group nonperforming assets by business and as a percentage of the owned finance assets held for investment for each business are as follows 

 

we believe that nonperforming assets generally will continue to increase as we execute our liquidation plan under the current economic conditions this plan is also likely to result in a slower rate of liquidation for nonperforming assets the increase in nonperforming assets is primarily attributable to 110 million in the golf mortgage portfolio with one golf mortgage account financing 14 golf courses representing 64 of this amount and 74 million in the resort portfolio largely due to one resort account financing eight resorts and the associated timeshare notes receivable which represented 92 of the balance in addition nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs increased substantially in the distribution finance portfolio reflecting continued weakening us economic conditions 

in 2007 the increases in nonperforming assets as a percentage of owned finance assets for assetbased lending and distribution finance compared with 2006 relate to weakening us economic conditions which began to have a negative impact on borrowers in certain industries 

  liquidity and capital resources 

borrowing group presentation 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with all of its majorityowned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna bell textron systems and industrial segments except for textron financial corporation the finance group consists of textron financial corporation consolidated with its subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

recent developments 

historically the principal source of liquidity for the manufacturing group has been operating cash flows and we have had additional shortterm liquidity available to us through the commercial paper market while for our longterm capital needs we have been able to access the public capital markets our finance group has historically funded its operations through commercial paper borrowings issuances of mediumterm notes and other term debt securities and syndication and securitization of receivables 

due to unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the credit markets beginning in the second half of 2008 we experienced difficulty in accessing the commercial paper markets at favorable rates and terms on several days in early 2009 we were unable to place sufficient amounts of commercial paper to meet our finance group’s needs resulting in our finance group borrowing on its bank line of credit the adverse impact that the credit market deterioration has had on us has been exacerbated by the recent downgrades of our credit ratings which have adversely impacted our ability to access the term debt market 

given the current economic environment and the risks associated with the capital markets in general including the current unavailability to us of public unsecured term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis on february 3 2009 we drew down on the balance of the 30 billion committed bank credit lines available to textron and textron financial corporation after repayment of all commercial paper outstanding this provides us with an aggregate amount of added cash liquidity of approximately 12 billion together with the proceeds of planned liquidations and cash flow from our manufacturing group we expect that this amount will be more than sufficient to repay the finance group’s maturing term debt during 2009 

early in the fourth quarter of 2008 in order to reduce our reliance on short term funding our board of directors approved the recommendation of management to downsize the finance segment the plan approved at that time entailed exiting the finance group’s assetbased lending and structured capital businesses as well as several additional product lines and limiting new originations in the distribution finance golf finance and resort finance businesses as conditions continued to worsen on december 22 2008 our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textronmanufactured products we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and in order to address our longterm liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets 

in total the exit plan will impact approximately 73 billion of the finance segment’s 108 billion managed receivable portfolio as of the end of 2008 the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years under this exit plan we expect to liquidate at least 26 billion of managed finance receivables net of originations in 2009 of which approximately 20 billion will be used to pay down offbalance sheet securitized debt the remainder of the planned liquidations will be utilized to repay a portion of the term debt issued by the finance group that is maturing in 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we approved a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve productivity across the company the restructuring program along with other volumerelated reductions in workforce during the fourth quarter of 2008 and in january 2009 eliminates approximately 6300 positions worldwide representing approximately 15 of our global workforce 

  we expect the economic uncertainty and capital market turbulence to continue into 2009 in order to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to repay our maturing debt obligations during the first quarter of 2010 and beyond our focus will be the maximization of cash flow through the following initiatives 

 

in 2008 our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of 023 per common share on february 25 2009 we announced that our board of directors has voted to reduce our quarterly dividend to 002 per share for the first quarter of 2009 this decision is intended to increase our liquidity in the longterm interest of our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend is reviewed quarterly and requires declaration by our board of directors 

in addition we are continuing to explore other potential avenues of liquidity including funding sources in the capital markets and are actively pursuing new financing structures for the finance group which would be secured directly by its finance receivable portfolio as well as extensions of existing securitization vehicles in december 2008 the finance group extended the revolving term of its aviation finance securitization by one year which is estimated to provide additional liquidity of approximately 100 million during 2009 as the current portfolio securing this funding source matures and is replaced with additional finance receivables 

depending on the success of the above cash flow initiatives and changes in external factors affecting the marketability and value of our assets we may consider the sale of additional assets in the finance business or the sale of certain manufacturing businesses we believe that with the successful execution of the finance group’s exit plan combined with other liquidity actions discussed above and the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations we will be able to raise cash sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs 

bank facilities and other sources of capital 

our aggregate 30 billion in committed bank lines of credit have historically been in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only there were no borrowings outstanding related to the manufacturing group’s 125 billion facility or the finance group’s 175 billion facility at the end of 2008 or 2007 in february 2009 due to the unavailability of term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis we drew the available balance from these credit facilities amounts borrowed under the credit facilities will not be due until april 2012 a portion of the proceeds will be used to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it comes due 

the debt net of cashtocapital ratio for our manufacturing group was 46 at january 3 2009 compared with 32 at december 29 2007 and the gross debttocapital ratio at january 3 2009 was 52 compared with 38 at december 29 2007 

the manufacturing group maintains an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities and the finance group maintains an effective shelf registration statement that allows it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt securities in the first half of 2008 the finance group issued 675 million of term debt under its registration statement 

contractual obligations 

finance group 

due to the nature of finance companies we believe that it is meaningful to include contractual cash receipts that we expect to receive in the future the finance group generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables the following table summarizes the finance group’s liquidity position including all managed finance receivables and both on and offbalance sheet funding sources as of january 3 2009 for the specified periods 

   

 

 this liquidity profile combined with the excess cash generated by the drawdown of our credit facilities is an indicator of the finance group’s ability to repay outstanding funding obligations assuming contractual collection of all finance receivables absent access to new sources of liquidity or origination of additional finance receivables in addition at january 3 2009 our finance group had 338 million in other liabilities primarily including accounts payable and accrued expenses that are payable within the next 12 months 

  at january 3 2009 the finance group had 12 billion of unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under revolving lines of credit compared to 16 billion at december 29 2007 these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and funding under these facilities is dependent on the availability of eligible collateral and compliance with customary financial covenants since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements we also have ongoing customer relationships including manufacturers and dealers in the distribution finance division which do not contractually obligate us to provide funding however we may choose to fund certain of these relationships to facilitate an orderly liquidation and mitigate credit losses neither of these potential fundings is included as contractual obligations in the table above 

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of january 3 2009 as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 

 

 

 we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually consistent with applicable laws and regulations however future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately 50 million to 55 million in 2009 based on our current assumptions which may change with changes in market conditions our current annual contribution for each of the years from 2010 through 2013 is estimated to be approximately 375 million under the plan provisions in place at this time 

other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of january 3 2009 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes and unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january 3 2009 the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

  credit ratings 

credit ratings are a critical component of our ability to access the public term debt and commercial paper markets and also impact the cost of those borrowings factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the industries in which we operate our financial position and changes in our business strategy since highquality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost we target a longterm a rating from the independent debtrating agencies while historically we have been able to achieve this target rating in recent months the longterm ratings for both borrowing groups were downgraded several times by all of the debtrating agencies 

the credit ratings and outlooks of the debtrating agencies at february 25 2009 are as follows 

 

the major rating agencies regularly evaluate both borrowing groups and their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and factors outside our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our longterm credit ratings have been downgraded several times in recent months and fitch ratings downgraded our shortterm credit rating on february 9 2009 in connection with these rating actions the rating agencies have cited concerns about the finance group including execution risks associated with our current plan to exit the noncaptive finance businesses and the need for textron inc to make capital contributions to textron financial corporation as well as lowerthanexpected business and financial outlook for 2009 the increase in outstanding debt resulting from the drawdown on our credit facilities weak economic conditions and continued liquidity and funding constraints failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings that are acceptable to investors would prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets and may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain other financing as well as our access to the capital markets 

manufacturing group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group are summarized below 

 

under a support agreement between textron financial corporation and textron inc textron inc is required to maintain a controlling interest in textron financial corporation the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million due to a goodwill impairment charge of 169 million at textron financial corporation along with other charges resulting from the exit plan discussed above on december 29 2008 textron inc made a cash payment of 625 million to textron financial corporation which was reflected as a capital contribution to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and to maintain the leverage ratio required by its credit facility due to the nature of this contribution we classified this contribution within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group resulting in the significant decline in cash provided by operating activities capital contributions to support finance group growth are classified as cash flows from financing activities the finance group’s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group’s cash flows while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 

excluding the capital contribution to the finance group cash provided by operating activities totaled 1 billion reflecting consistent cash flow from the manufacturing group even with continued investment in our working capital changes in our working capital components resulted in a 476 million and 101 million use of cash in 2008 and 2007 respectively and a 123 million source of cash in 2006 a significant use of operating cash is related to increased production levels during the year and inventory buildup at bell and cessna cash used for inventories totaled 657 million 446 million and 364 million 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively partially offsetting the use of cash for inventories were 

  customer deposits within accrued liabilities which provided a significant source of operating cash customer deposits increased 88 million 290 million and 128 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

investing cash flows in 2008 were largely driven by capital expenditures of 542 million in 2008 375 million in 2007 and 407 million in 2006 for 2009 we plan to reduce our capital spending to about 315 million consistent with our reduced capacity requirements in 2008 and 2007 we paid 109 million and 11 billion largely related to the aai acquisition in 2006 we paid 338 million primarily related to the acquisition of overwatch systems 

in 2008 financing activities include 867 million in commercial paper borrowings of which a portion was used to make a cash payment for a capital contribution and for a loan to the finance group as we experienced limited ability to obtain financing at favorable rates in the second half of 2008 we borrowed 222 million against the cash surrender value of our corporateowned officers’ life insurance policies in 2008 these cash inflows from financing activities were offset by share repurchases of 533 million the maturity of two bonds requiring payments of 348 million dividends paid to shareholders of 284 million and net lending to the finance group of 133 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the manufacturing group utilized its commercial paper borrowings to lend cash to the finance group a portion of these intergroup borrowings were repaid in the fourth quarter primarily with funds from the 625 million capital contribution discussed above at january 3 2009 the finance group owed the manufacturing group 133 million related to these borrowings 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we repurchased approximately 12 million 6 million and 17 million shares of common stock respectively under boardauthorized share repurchase programs in september 2008 we suspended all share repurchase activity 

we used 996 million less cash for financing activities in 2007 compared with 2006 the decrease is due principally to the issuance of 350 million in 10year notes in 2007 the paydown of 241 million of shortterm debt in 2006 and a 457 million decrease in 2007 in purchases of our common stock from 2006 

our annual dividend increased to 092 in 2008 from 085 in 2007 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 284 million 154 million and 244 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in four payments in 2008 three payments in 2007 and five payments in 2006 

finance group cash flows 

the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below 

 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for both 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to the timing of payments of income taxes and accrued interest and other liabilities 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased during 2008 primarily due to a 627 million decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections mostly the result of the decision to exit portions of the finance business resulting in lower originations partially offset by lower proceeds from receivable sales including securitizations of 363 million and the purchase of notes receivable issued by securitization trusts of 100 million cash used for investing activities decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 largely due to a 774 million decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections a 481 million increase in proceeds from receivable sales including securitizations and the 164 million impact in 2006 of cash used for an acquisition proceeds from receivable sales increased primarily due to the sale of 588 million of receivables into the distribution finance revolving securitization in 2007 

less cash was provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings related to the reduction in managed receivable growth and higher principal payments largely offset by the 625 million capital contribution received from the manufacturing group in 2008 under its support agreement the decrease in financing cash inflows in 2007 primarily reflects a reduction in borrowings due to lower managed receivable growth in comparison with 2006 in addition during 2007 we used the proceeds from receivable sales including securitizations to fund asset growth instead of additional borrowings 

  consolidated cash flows 

the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups are summarized below 

 

consolidated cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to investment in working capital as discussed in more detail within the “manufacturing group cash flows” section herein 

cash used for investing activities decreased due to the 11 billion in cash used for acquisitions in 2007 primarily related to aai cash used for investing activities decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 largely due to a 786 million decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections excluding 12 million from captive financing activities and a 424 million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations collections excluding 57 million from captive financing activities these decreases were partially offset by 590 million in higher cash outflows for acquisitions in 2007 we acquired four businesses including aai for a total outflow of 11 billion while in 2006 we acquired three businesses for 502 million including overwatch systems and electrolux financial corporation 

we received less cash from financing activities in 2008 primarily due to 663 million in lower proceeds from borrowings net of principal payments we also used 229 million more for share repurchases and 130 million more for dividend payments to shareholders which were partially offset by 222 million in proceeds we received from borrowings against the cash surrender value of corporateowned officers’ life insurance policies in 2008 

we received less cash from financing activities in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in borrowings largely a result of lower managed receivable growth in comparison with 2006 in addition during 2007 we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables including securitizations to fund asset growth instead of additional borrowings the decrease in cash borrowed by the finance group in 2007 from 2006 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of 350 million in 10year notes by the manufacturing group in 2007 a 457 million decrease in the purchases of our common stock and 90 million in lower dividend payments due to timing 

captive financing and other intercompany transactions 

the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

 

  consolidated discontinued operations cash flows 

the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid  power business of approximately 479 million which is recorded in investing activities after taxes and other dealrelated expenses are paid we expect total net aftertax proceeds for the sale to be approximately 380 million this excludes any cash proceeds related to the final payment to be determined based on the fluid  power 2008 operating results in 2007 cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits from the fastening systems business in 2006 cash inflows from investing activities include net cash proceeds of 636 million for the sale of the fastening systems business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

performance guarantee 

in 2004 through our bell helicopter business we formed agustawestlandbell llc awb llc with agustawestland north america inc awna this venture was created for the joint design development manufacture sale customer training and product support of the vh71 helicopter and certain variations and derivatives thereof to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government in march 2005 awb llc received a 12 billion cost reimbursementtype subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program which was increased to 14 billion in december 2008 we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49 of awb llc’s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract agustawestland nv awna’s parent company has guaranteed the remaining 51 to lockheed martin we have entered into crossindemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s workshare under any subcontracts received awb llc’s maximum obligation is 50 of the total contract value of 676 million for a maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee of 331 million at january 3 2009 through completion under the current phase of the contract we do not believe that there is any performance risk with respect to the guarantee in late january 2009 the pentagon declared a nunnmccurdy act breach for this program due to cost overruns requiring recertification of the program we do not have enough information at this time to make a determination of whether the program will be recertified however if the program were to be terminated we do not believe that the guarantee will be triggered as it relates solely to performance under the subcontract 

finance receivable sales and securitizations 

the finance group primarily sells finance receivables utilizing assetbacked securitization structures as a result of these transactions finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet and the proceeds received are used to reduce recorded debt levels despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 

we utilize offbalance sheet financing arrangements to further diversify funding alternatives and termination of these arrangements would reduce our shortterm funding alternatives which could result in increased funding costs for our managed finance receivable portfolio while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require us to repurchase significant amounts of receivables previously sold there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future potential barriers to the continued use of these offbalance sheet arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality downgrades in our debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements we do not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on our liquidity or income from operations and if we were required to consolidate these arrangements it would have no impact on our existing debt covenants 

  as of january 3 2009 we have one significant offbalance sheet financing arrangement the distribution finance revolving securitization trust is a master trust that purchases inventory finance receivables from our finance group and issues assetbacked notes to investors these receivables typically have short durations which results in significant collections of previously purchased receivables and significant additional purchases of replacement receivables from us on a monthly basis this arrangement has provided net proceeds of 125 million in 2008 549 million in 2007 and 50 million 2006 and net pretax gains of 36 million 58 million and 42 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to the issuance of additional assetbacked notes to investors and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these shortduration receivables 

during 2008 802 million of the outstanding notes issued by the distribution finance revolving securitization trust matured and the trust issued variable funding notes in the amount of 559 million maturing in september 2009 and 419 million maturing in may 2009 we retained 103 million of these notes both notes have an interest rate equal to the commercial paper costs of the conduit purchasers in addition the trust holds 12 billion of onemonth liborbased variablerate notes with threeyear terms approximately 642 million of these notes mature in april 2009 and 588 million mature in march 2010 we retained 80 million of these notes the amount of pretax gains recorded upon the ongoing sale of receivables in this arrangement and the value of our subordinated interest are impacted by the pricing of the investor notes issued by the trust therefore an increase in the pricing of investor notes issued upon the maturity of the existing notes could have a negative impact on the gains recognized by the finance group related to future sales of receivables 

critical accounting estimates 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 

we evaluate our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment based on a combination of factors for homogeneous loan pools we examine current delinquencies the characteristics of the existing accounts historical loss experience the value of the underlying collateral general economic conditions and trends and the potential impact of the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers as a result of our current decision to exit our noncaptive finance businesses we estimate losses will range from 075 to 100 of finance receivables held for investment depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool for larger balance commercial loans we also consider borrower specific information industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 

provision for losses on finance receivables held for investment are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment at a level considered adequate to cover losses inherent in the owned finance receivable held for investment portfolio based on management’s evaluation and analysis of this portfolio while management believes that its consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment currently represents 276 of total finance receivables held for investment during the last five years net chargeoffs as a percentage of finance receivables held for investment have ranged from 038 to 148 

finance receivables held for sale 

as a result of our exit plan 17 billion of our finance receivable portfolio is classified as held for sale and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the remaining 69 billion of receivables in our finance receivable portfolio is classified as held for investment upon the initial reclassification of these receivables to held for sale we estimated the fair value to be 293 million less than the carrying value net of the 44 million allowance for loan losses attributable to these portfolios this net adjustment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  finance receivables are classified as held for sale based on the determination that we no longer intend to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or there is no longer the ability to hold to maturity our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors including but not limited to contractual duration type of collateral credit strength of the borrowers the existence of continued contractual commitments the perceived marketability of the receivables and our ability to hold the receivables to maturity on an ongoing basis these factors combined with our overall liquidation strategy determine which finance receivables we have the positive intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale 

our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value andor the marketability of our finance receivables a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables if we subsequently determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold the finance receivables will be reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time conversely if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity these receivables would be designated as held for sale and a valuation allowance would be established at that time if necessary at january 3 2009 if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements see page 71 in note 10 fair values of assets and liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the assets and liabilities that are currently not recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 

finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of transfer to the held for sale classification we establish a valuation allowance for any shortfall between the carrying value net of all deferred fees and costs and fair value upon the initial classification to held for sale any shortfall is recorded as a charge within special charges in addition any allowance for loan losses previously allocated to these receivables is reclassified to the valuation allowance account which is netted with finance receivables held for sale on the balance sheet after the valuation allowance is initially established it is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the fair value of the receivables below the original carrying value with subsequent adjustments included in earnings within segment profit fair value changes can occur based on market interest rates market liquidity and changes in the credit quality of the borrower and value of underlying loan collateral 

there are no active quoted market prices for our finance receivables the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction which includes the sale of both pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return financing cost capital structure andor discount rate expectations of prospective purchasers combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses payment rates and credit line utilization rates where available the assumptions related to the expectations of prospective purchasers were compared to observable market inputs including bids from prospective purchasers and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models these inputs are rarely derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures industries and collateral types therefore all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and cost of a contract we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the costtocost method which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the unitsofdelivery method which is used for production effort as appropriate under the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions 

  and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired see the “special charges” section on page 19 for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill at the finance segment subsequent to this impairment we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2008 using the estimates from our longterm strategic plans no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 

our market capitalization at january 3 2009 was approximately 37 billion compared with approximately 179 billion at december 29 2007 this market capitalization is less than the sum of the fair values of our manufacturing reporting units calculated in connection with our annual impairment test we believe that the differences between the fair value estimates of our manufacturing reporting units and our market capitalization are primarily due to the market’s view of risk in the finance segment as noted above we have fully impaired goodwill at the finance segment and concerns over our liquidity we believe that our fair value estimates for our manufacturing reporting units are consistent with market participant assumptions 

goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions if different assumptions were used in these forecasts the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

during the second half of 2008 kautex was negatively impacted by the significant downturn in the automotive industry which caused deterioration in its revenues and segment profit our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability for kautex was extended to include our projections and outlook for the automotive industry as of the end of the fourth quarter and we believe the carrying value of the reporting unit is recoverable at january 3 2009 we anticipate volumes to continue to be lower through 2010 from 2009 through 2013 for purposes of our goodwill analysis we have assumed an average annual sales growth rate of 6 with operating profit margins returning to recent historical levels by 2013 operating profit margin improvements are expected to result from significant restructuring activities including realignment of excess capacity through personnel reductions as well as from higher volumes a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated operating profit margins during the 2009 to 2013 period used in our discounted cash flow model would reduce the estimated fair value of kautex by up to 60 million and may result in the carrying value of the business exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting an impairment charge at january 3 2009 the goodwill allocated to kautex totaled 130 million 

our operating plans and projections for our golf  turfcare component anticipate operating margin improvements over the fiveyear planning period resulting in high singledigit margins and assume annual revenue growth of approximately 4 a 100basispoint decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately 50 million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at january 3 2009 the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately 141 million 

  retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2008 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 866 compared with 863 in 2007 in 2008 and 2007 the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans which represent approximately 95 of our total pension assets was 875 and 874 respectively a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return would result in a 22 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2008 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 599 compared with 563 in 2007 for our qualified domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 60 in 2008 compared with 566 for 2007 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate would result in a 28 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2008 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2008 medical rate of 7 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2019 and then remain at that level the 2008 prescription drug rate of 10 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2019 and then remain at that level see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

warranty liabilities 

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls 

we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate 

we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

securitized transactions 

securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts we may retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of interestonly securities seller certificates cash reserve accounts and servicing rights and obligations at the time of sale a gain or loss is recorded based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the finance receivables sold the allocated carrying value is determined based on the relative fair values of the finance receivables sold and the interests retained as such the fair value estimate of the retained interests has a direct impact on the gain or loss recorded we estimate fair value based on the present value of future cash flows using management’s best estimates of key assumptions – credit losses prepayment speeds discount rates and forward interest rate yield curves commensurate with the risks involved 

  we review the fair values of the retained interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the carrying value when the carrying value exceeds the fair value we determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary when we determine the value of the decline is other than temporary we write down the securities to fair value with a corresponding charge to income when a change in fair value of the interestonly securities is deemed temporary we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of key assumptions used to record initial gains related to the sale of finance receivables through securitizations and to measure the current fair value of the interestonly securities 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss as appropriate in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable we recognize net taxrelated interest and penalties in income tax expense if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt and vice versa the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate debt we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixedrate debt and adjust the mix as necessary based on our evaluation of internal and external factors the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2008 2007 or 2006 

our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at january 3 2009 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 30 billion net of 21 billion of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixedrate debt to a floatingrate equivalent classified within fixedrate assets are 30 billion of floating rate loans with index rate floors that are on average 224 basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate these assets will remain classified as fixedrate until the prime rate increases above the floor rates we have benefited from the interest rate floor arrangements in the recent low rate environment however in a rising rate environment this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by 25 million in 2008 and increased interest expense by 25 million and 27 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured andor sold for 2008 the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2007 increased revenues by approximately 90 million 07 and decreased segment profit by approximately 2 million 01 

for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 10 billion at the end of 2008 and 11 billion at the end of 2007 

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts for our common stock we utilize forward contracts for our common stock to manage the expense related to our stockbased compensation awards 

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a 10 decrease in the quoted market price of our common stock

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impact our business financial condition or results of operations perhaps materially 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government 

  

during 2007 we derived approximately 19 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our us government revenues have continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of uic our ability to compete successfully for and retain us government business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel our revenues from the us government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various us government programs primarily defenserelated programs the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions although multipleyear contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs often are only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations the reduction or termination of funding or changes in the timing of funding for a us government program in which we provide products or services would result in a reduction or loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program and could have a negative impact on our results of operations while the overall level of us defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons including increases in funding of operations in iraq and afghanistan and the us department of defense’s military transformation initiatives we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow or not be reduced significant changes in national and international priorities for defense spending could impact the funding or the time of funding of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

  

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 

  

if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced in accordance with contract terms by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition 

  

  

on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor 

  

as a us government contractor we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 

  

we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts these laws and regulations among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts and under certain circumstances suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time these laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

  

contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance estimates of award fees also are used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of these estimates it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial results of operations 

  

under fixedprice contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under cost reimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

delays in aircraft delivery schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect our financial results 

  

aircraft customers including sellers of fractional share interests may respond to weak economic conditions by delaying delivery of orders or canceling orders weakness in the economy may result in fewer hours flown on existing aircraft and consequently lower demand for spare parts and maintenance weak economic conditions also may cause reduced demand for used business jets or helicopters we may accept used aircraft on tradein that would be subject to fluctuations in the fair market value of the aircraft while in inventory reduced demand for new and used aircraft spare parts and maintenance can have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

  

delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft products and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft products coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

  

  

we have entered and expect to continue to enter into joint venture teaming and other arrangements and these activities involve risks and uncertainties 

  

we have entered and expect to continue to enter into joint venture teaming and other arrangements and these activities involve risks and uncertainties including the risk of the joint venture or related business partner failing to satisfy its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements 

  

we may make acquisitions and dispositions that increase the risks of our business 

  

we may enter into acquisitions or dispositions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value acquisitions or dispositions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits with respect to acquisitions such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses with respect to dispositions the decision to dispose of a business or asset may result in a writedown of the related assets if the fair market value of the assets less costs of disposal is less than the book value in addition we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner we may also underestimate the costs of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations in addition unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions or dispositions may divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 

  

our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control 

  

our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders in addition we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers and even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations 

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

  

approximately 14000 of our employees or 32 of our total employees are unionized as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

in addition to our workforce the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

  

our international business is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

our international business exposes us to certain unique and potentially greater risks than our domestic business and our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow our international business is subject to local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges as well as to varying currency geopolitical and economic risks we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs 

  

our finance borrowing group’s business is dependent on its continuing access to the capital markets 

  

our financings are conducted through two borrowing groups finance and manufacturing our finance group consists of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries which are the entities through which we operate in the finance segment our finance group relies on its access to the capital markets to fund asset growth fund operations and meet debt obligations and other commitments this group raises funds through 

  

  

commercial paper borrowings issuances of mediumterm notes and other term debt securities and syndication and securitization of receivables additional liquidity is provided to our finance group through bank lines of credit much of the capital markets funding is made possible by the maintenance of credit ratings that are acceptable to investors if the credit ratings of our finance group were to be lowered it might face higher borrowing costs a disruption of its access to the capital markets or both our finance group also could lose access to financing for other reasons such as a general disruption of the capital markets any disruption of our finance group’s access to the capital markets could adversely affect its business and our profitability 

  

if our finance group is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

a key determinant of financial performance of our finance group is its ability to maintain the quality of loans leases and other credit products in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may adversely be affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality geographic or industry concentrations or general economic downturns any inability by our finance group to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem accounts may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to private transactions government contracts lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability employment and environmental safety and health matters under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

  

in addition to reserves at our finance group we establish reserves in our manufacturing group to cover uncollectible accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers 

  

in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable 

  

the effect on our financial results of many of these factors depends in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering potential losses at reasonable rates 

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

  

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

  

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated in some cases we are able to offset these reductions through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner such events 

  

  

  

may adversely affect our financial results of operations or damage our reputation and relationships with our customers the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular product or service 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

  

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our pension plans which are dependent on actual plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of plan benefit obligations 

  

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

business overview 

  

2007 was an exceptional year in many respects we experienced strong sales and organic growth particularly in our aerospace and defense businesses cessna set a new record with 773 jet orders while demand for commercial helicopters remained strong with bell helicopter recording 268 orders our aircraft and defense backlog increased to 188 billion up 45 from a year ago 

  

we strategically acquired businesses to complement our core growth areas the most significant of which was the acquisition of united industrial corporation “uic” uic operating through its wholly owned subsidiary aai corporation “aai” is a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations aircraft and satellite test equipment training systems and countersniper devices in addition to aai we acquired certain assets of cavair llc a helicopter maintenance and service center columbia aircraft manufacturing corporation which produces highperformance single engine aircraft and paladin tools a provider of tools and accessories for the telecommunications industry we paid approximately 11 billion in cash for these four acquisitions 

  

we also made considerable investments in innovation new product development and capacity expansion across our businesses including the continued development of our commercial aircraft product offerings with the bell model 429 and the cessna cj4 

  

in our finance segment we generated significant growth in our managed finance receivables while portfolio quality statistics remained relatively stable 

  

in july our board of directors approved a twoforone stock split of our common stock and increased our annual dividend by 19 to 092 per share we have continued to repurchase our common stock spending 295 million in 2007 to acquire approximately 6 million shares with a 30 increase in income from continuing operations during 2007 and these share repurchases our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 32 to 359 per share 

  

 diluted earnings per share are for continuing operations only 

  

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

revenues 

  

revenues increased 17 billion or 15 to 132 billion in 2007 compared with 2006 the primary reasons for this increase are 

  

· higher manufacturing volume of 10 billion with 631 million at cessna primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries 253 million in bell’s us government business largely related to the h1 program and higher armored security vehicle “asv” deliveries and a 148 million increase in the industrial segment principally due to higher demand at kautex 

· higher pricing of 344 million with 212 million at cessna 94 million in bell’s commercial business and 46 million in the industrial segment 

· additional revenues from newly acquired businesses of 166 million primarily the acquisitions of overwatch systems and aai in the bell segment 

· favorable foreign exchange impact of 148 million in the industrial segment and 

· a 66 million impact from higher average finance receivables due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses in the finance segment 

  

in 2006 our revenues increased 15 billion or 14 compared with 2005 primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of 10 billion higher pricing of 274 million and higher revenues in the finance segment of 170 million 

  

segment profit 

  

segment profit increased 373 million or 29 to 16 billion in 2007 compared with 2006 this increase is primarily due to the following factors which were partially offset by inflation of 256 million 

  

· higher pricing of 344 million with 212 million at cessna 94 million in bell’s commercial business and 46 million in the industrial segment 

· favorable cost performance of 164 million which includes net charges in 2007 for the armed reconnaissance helicopter “arh” low rate initial production “lrip” program of 50 million the 32 million favorable impact of the recovery of arh system development and demonstration “sdd” launchrelated costs written off in 2006 and lower charges related to the h1 lrip program of 43 million 

· a 148 million net benefit from higher volume partially offset by unfavorable product mix and 

· profit from newly acquired businesses of 20 million 

  

in 2006 our segment profit increased 121 million or 11 compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pricing of 274 million higher sales volume of 198 million improved cost performance of 54 million in the industrial segment favorable warranty performance at cessna of 39 million and higher profit in the finance segment of 39 million these increases were partially offset by inflation of 272 million higher spending for engineering and new product development of 74 million higher overhead of 55 million in bell’s commercial business and increased charges related to the h1 lrip program of 68 million 

  

corporate expenses and other net 

  

corporate expenses and other net increased 51 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the following 

  

· 26 million of higher compensation expenses largely related to stock appreciation 

· 14 million of higher professional and consulting fees related to corporate initiatives 

· 11 million of increased costs for divested operations primarily due to higher pension costs and other retained liabilities and 

· a 6 million increase in our contribution to the textron charitable trust 

· partially offset by an 8 million gain on an insurance settlement 

  

corporate expenses and other net increased 3 million in 2006 compared with 2005 principally due to 7 million of higher sharebased compensation expense and 4 million of higher incentive compensation partially offset by 8 million of lower expenses related to corporate initiatives 

  

special charges 

  

there were no special charges in 2007 or 2006 in 2005 special charges totaled 118 million and included 112 million related to the 2001 disposition of the automotive trim “trim” business and 6 million in restructuring expense in the industrial segment 

  

  

in 2005 the 112 million in special charges that were incurred in connection with the disposition of trim included 91 million in impairment charges to write down preferred stock acquired in the disposition and 21 million to cover exposures related to certain guarantees for leases environmental and workers’ compensation matters 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate increased to 296 in 2007 from 276 in 2006 in comparison with the federal statutory rate in 2007 we had a 17 less favorable impact attributed to our foreign tax rate differential a 12 favorable impact on the 2006 rate related to the adoption of the canadian dollar as the functional currency for us tax purposes of one of our canadian subsidiaries and a 13 less favorable impact from tax settlements in 2007 compared with settlements in 2006 partially offset by a 13 impact from lower state income taxes and a 1 benefit related to the manufacturing deduction the effective tax rate decreased to 276 in 2006 from 302 in 2005 largely due to the impact of these items on the 2006 effective tax rate 

  

discontinued operations 

  

discontinued operations primarily reflect aftertax results of the fastening systems business which was sold in 2006 operating results of our discontinued businesses are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2006 the loss from discontinued operations primarily includes a 120 million aftertax impairment charge for the fastening systems business based on the estimated fair value less cost to sell at the time according to offers received from potential purchasers in 2005 the loss from discontinued operations includes a 335 million goodwill impairment charge related to the fastening systems business in addition we recorded an aftertax charge of approximately 52 million which included 37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and 7 million in curtailment losses for employee retirement plans the gain on disposal net of income taxes of 46 million in 2005 primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of intesys 

  

segment analysis 

  

our four reportable segments are bell cessna industrial and finance these segments reflect the manner in which we manage our operations segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decisionmaking purposes segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense certain corporate expenses and special charges the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 

  

each segment’s revenues and profit as a percentage of consolidated revenues and profit are provided below 

  

  

bell 

  

   

  

bell helicopter is in the early stages of development or production for a number of government and commercial programs that are anticipated to significantly drive revenue and profit growth in future years government programs generally follow a threephase cycle consisting of development transition to production and fullrate production each phase has specific risks and operational challenges over the next few years the segment’s major government programs will be transitioning through various phases of this cycle bell helicopter programs with the us government include the v22 tiltrotor the h1 and the arh bell helicopter’s commercial business has invested in the commercial version of the tiltrotor aircraft and the new model 429 during 2007 we expect to receive faa certification of the model 429 in the 20082009 timeframe major programs at textron systems include the asv and unmanned aircraft systems 

  

in the past two years we have made significant investments to conduct research and development transition development contracts to production increase our production capacity and implement improved operational systems to manage anticipated growth in bell helicopter’s government programs and commercial product lines the costs of investing in improved operational systems resulted in higher overhead expenses during 2006 due to the shorter production cycle for our commercial business the higher overhead costs in 2006 were reflected in lower earnings in that year however since our government business has a longer production cycle a portion of these costs was also absorbed into workinprogress inventory particularly for the v22 accordingly as v22 aircraft were delivered in 2007 the overhead expenses reflected in inventory resulted in lower margins while overhead expenses moderated in 2007 we expect higher overhead costs in the future largely due to costs incurred to support significant rampup to fullrate production of the v22 aircraft 

  

during 2007 textron systems successfully integrated its fourth quarter 2006 acquisition overwatch systems into its business and completed the acquisition of aai as a leading provider of intelligent aerospace and defense systems including unmanned aircraft and ground control stations aircraft and satellite test equipment training systems and countersniper devices aai significantly augments our product offering to the us government 

  

bell revenues 

  

us government business 

  

revenues increased 388 million in 2007 for the us government business compared with 2006 primarily due to higher volume and mix of 253 million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of 122 million the volume increase is primarily due to the following 

  

· 161 million in higher h1 program revenue principally due to delivery of the first 10 production units 

· 78 million in higher asv revenue due to a 21 increase in deliveries to 576 units 

· a 70 million increase in v22 program revenue primarily due to higher spares revenues 

· 56 million in higher revenue for intelligent battlefield systems and 

· a 16 million increase from sensor fused weapon deliveries 

  

these increases were partially offset by 

  

· lower spares and service sales of 74 million for military helicopters other than the v22 and 

· lower joint direct attack munitions volume of 63 million 

  

in 2006 revenues increased 376 million compared with 2005 primarily due to higher net volume and mix of 343 million and the benefit from acquisitions of 28 million the volume increase is primarily due to higher asv deliveries of 286 million higher arh sdd development revenues of 94 million increased spares and service sales of 37 million and additional intelligent battlefield systems volume of 22 million partially offset by lower v22 volume of 80 million and lower h1 revenue of 18 million 

  

commercial business 

  

in 2007 revenues for the commercial business increased 119 million compared with 2006 primarily due to higher pricing of 94 million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of 43 million partially offset by lower volume of 17 million volume decreased as higher helicopter deliveries of 50 million were more than offset by lower huey ii kit deliveries of 44 million and lower spares and service volume of 18 million 

  

in 2006 revenues increased 151 million for our commercial business compared with 2005 due to higher volume of 105 million and pricing of 46 million the volume increase is primarily due to higher civil aircraft deliveries of 176 million higher spares and service sales of 53 million and additional deliveries of huey ii kits of 10 million partially offset by lower international military deliveries of 116 million 

  

  

bell segment profit 

  

us government business 

  

segment profit in our us government business increased 39 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to improved cost performance of 64 million higher net volume and mix of 16 million and the benefit from acquisitions of 10 million partially offset by the impact from inflation and pricing of 30 million the improved cost performance is primarily due to 

  

·  43 million in lower charges for the h1 lrip program which are discussed in more detail below 

·   25 million in lower costs related to the arh sdd contract due to a 14 million 2006 writeoff of launchrelated costs and the 11 million impact of the subsequent partial recovery of these costs and 

· 21 million in improvements with asv due to improved productivity and lower indirect costs 

· partially offset by 50 million in arh lrip 2007 charges as discussed below and 

· 22 million in lower v22 profitability largely due to a 15 million impact from lower margin units which have been unfavorably impacted by higher overhead costs associated with increasing production capacity and a 6 million award fee recognized in 2006 

  

in 2006 profit in our us government business decreased 25 million compared with 2005 the decrease was primarily due to inflation of 33 million and unfavorable cost performance of 24 million partially offset by the impact of higher net volume and mix of 35 million the unfavorable performance reflected higher anticipated costs for the h1 lrip contracts of 68 million and charges of 14 million related to the arh sdd contract partially offset by favorable program performance at textron systems of 34 million primarily related to hurricane katrina 

  

h1 program — the h1 program continues in development while we are concurrently working on the initial production aircraft under firm fixedprice lrip contracts with the us government in 2006 we recorded program charges of 82 million related to the lrip contracts through the third quarter of 2006 we recorded 29 million in charges based on our estimate that the costs to complete would exceed contractual reimbursement during the transition to production phase these charges primarily reflected the impact of higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements and higher anticipated efforts in final assembly in the fourth quarter of 2006 acceptance of the initial aircraft by the us government was delayed and no aircraft were delivered this delay was a result of changes in the development and engineering requirements that were identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing due to this delay and the costs associated with the additional development efforts rework of inprocess units and resulting inefficiencies and a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements we increased our estimate of the completion costs and recorded an additional 53 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 

  

during 2007 the production process has continued to mature and we have completed delivery of all the lot 1 aircraft as well as the first lot 2 aircraft our manufacturing performance during the year has been substantially consistent with our expectations prospectively our costs are anticipated to increase primarily due to anticipated delays in receiving cabins from a supplier additionally during the fourth quarter we committed to higher pricing levels on an anticipated lot 5 contract that will likely result in a loss once contract negotiations are finalized primarily due to higher cabin supplier costs accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a net charge of 30 million to reflect the higher cost estimates for existing contract completion resulting from supplier delays as well as the estimated loss resulting from our price commitment on the lot 5 contract 

  

arh program — the arh sdd contract is a cost plus incentive fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract costs increase in 2006 we continued our development activities as costs exceeded the original contract amount for this program and expensed 14 million in unreimbursed costs related to this effort in the third quarter of 2007 we reached an agreement with our customer under which we recovered 18 million of launchrelated costs previously written off the amount included 11 million that had been charged to our us government business and 7 million that had been charged to our commercial business through overheads in december 2007 we agreed to expand the scope of the development contract efforts on a funded basis 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed certain phases of the critical design review under the arh sdd contract and determined the initial production configuration of the aircraft including aircraft configuration changes required by the us government our cost estimates based on this configuration which included anticipated transition to production costs exceeded the fixed pricing contained in two options the us government had under this program for the first two lrip lots the option for the first lrip lot expired in 2006 while the option for the second lot for 1836 aircraft was set to expire in december 2007 at that time we were in discussions with the us government related to the possible reinstatement of the first option extension of the second option delivery schedule number of units to be exercised under the options and possible additional aircraft to be contracted in addition to those under the options at revised pricing at the end of 2006 due to the uncertainty 

  

  

of this exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions with the us government we did not believe that a loss was probable under the guidelines established by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

  

in march 2007 we received correspondence from the us government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed into the production phase of the arh program accordingly we provided for losses of 18 million in supplier obligations for longlead component production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated arh lrip contract awards 

  

in the second quarter of 2007 the us army agreed to replan the arh program and we reached a nonbinding memorandum of understanding “mou” related to aircraft specifications pricing methodology and delivery schedules for initial lrip aircraft we also agreed to conduct additional sdd activities on a funded basis based on the plan at that time and our related estimates of aircraft production costs including costs related to risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions we expected to lose approximately 73 million on the production of the proposed initial lrip aircraft accordingly an additional charge of 55 million was taken in the second quarter of 2007 for estimated lrip contract losses 

  

in december 2007 the us government’s remaining option related to production of aircraft under the original arh program expired unexercised we are continuing to restructure the program through negotiations with the us government including reducing the number of units and modifying the pricing and delivery schedules previously reached under the mou based on the current status of these negotiations and our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the anticipated production units we have procured at our risk we have revised our best estimate of the expected loss to 50 million resulting in a 23 million reduction of previously established reserves we expect that the initial lrip contract awards will be finalized in mid2008 until the contract negotiations are finalized including pricing aircraft specifications and delivery schedules losses related to future contract awards or additional recovery of our vendor obligations are uncertain 

  

commercial business 

  

in 2007 profit increased 47 million compared with 2006 primarily due to higher pricing of 94 million and lower engineering research and development expense of 18 million partially offset by inflation of 44 million and the net impact of an unfavorable product mix of 23 million lower overhead expense of 36 million which included a 7 million recovery discussed above related to the arh program was offset by higher costs of 37 million as we streamlined our legacy commercial product line resulting in certain vendor termination costs 

  

in 2006 profit decreased 94 million compared with 2005 primarily due to unfavorable cost performance of 140 million and inflation of 28 million partially offset by higher pricing of 46 million and the impact of increased volume and mix of 42 million 

  

the unfavorable cost performance reflected increased overhead costs of 55 million the impact of the 30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab139 program in 2005 higher net research and development expense of 29 million and the 13 million prior year impact of the resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a collaborative research and development agreement partially offset by 18 million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in 2005 for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 

  

cessna 

  

   

demand in the business jet market continued to strengthen in 2007 which was reflected in a 49 increase in our backlog in addition to a 26 increase in business jet deliveries over the past three years cessna has increased its annual production rate and has continued to focus on improving margins while investing in engineering research and development in cessna’s continual effort to bring new technology and products to market citation business jets are the largest component of cessna’s revenues we delivered 387 307 and 252 citation business jets in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

cessna revenues 

  

in 2007 cessna’s revenues increased 844 million compared with 2006 due to higher volume of 631 million primarily due to higher citation business jet deliveries and improved pricing of 212 million in 2006 revenues increased 676 million compared with 2005 due to higher volume of 493 million primarily related to citation business jets and improved pricing of 183 million 

  

  

cessna segment profit 

  

in 2007 cessna’s segment profit increased 220 million compared with 2006 primarily due to improved pricing along with the 139 million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of 14 million partially offset by inflation of 106 million and increased engineering and product development expense of 41 million favorable warranty performance included the 19 million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2007 related to initial model launches as discussed below partially offset by a lower benefit of 5 million from other favorable warranty performance a 28 million benefit in 2007 compared with 33 million in 2006 

  

segment profit increased 188 million at cessna in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to improved pricing the 102 million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of 39 million partially offset by inflation of 112 million and higher engineering and product development costs of 41 million favorable warranty performance included the 24 million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2006 related to initial model launches as discussed below as well as a 15 million incremental benefit from other favorable warranty performance in 2006 a 33 million benefit in 2006 compared with 18 million in 2005 

  

during initial model launches cessna typically incurs higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs generally moderate for the sovereign and cj3 production lines in the second half of 2006 management estimated that the production lines had reached this maturity level based on historical production and warranty patterns resulting in lower estimated warranty costs than earlier production aircraft accordingly cessna has had favorable warranty performance in the past two years due to the lower pointofsale warranty costs for sovereign and cj3 aircraft sold management expects improved performance on these models to continue in the foreseeable future 

  

industrial 

  

   

the industrial segment includes the businesses of kautex fluid  power greenlee ezgo and jacobsen during 2007 we experienced positive organic revenue growth largely due to doubledigit increases at fluid  power and greenlee including record sales at fluid  power in the fourth quarter greenlee expanded its product offerings through its acquisition of paladin tools and ezgo introduced its new energyefficient rxv golf car 

  

industrial revenues 

  

revenues in the industrial segment increased 307 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to higher volume of 148 million favorable foreign exchange impact of 148 million and higher pricing of 46 million partially offset by the 2006 divestiture of noncore product lines of 37 million 

  

revenues in the industrial segment increased 74 million in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to higher volume of 89 million higher pricing of 46 million and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 10 million partially offset by the divestiture of noncore product lines of 72 million 

  

industrial segment profit 

  

segment profit in the industrial segment increased 55 million in 2007 compared with 2006 mainly due to improved cost performance of 60 million higher pricing of 46 million the 20 million impact of higher volume and mix and a 15 million gain on the sale of land partially offset by inflation of 83 million improved cost performance was primarily attributable to cost reduction efforts at kautex while inflation largely reflects increases in material costs 

  

segment profit in the industrial segment increased 13 million in 2006 compared with 2005 mainly due to 54 million of improved cost performance higher pricing of 46 million and the 24 million impact of higher net volume and mix partially offset by 100 million of inflation and a 7 million impact from divestitures of noncore product lines 

  

  

  

finance 

  

   

during 2007 our finance segment’s managed finance receivables grew by 9 to 11 billion while our portfolio quality statistics remained relatively stable as a percentage of finance receivables our 60 day delinquency decreased to 043 at the end of 2007 from 077 at the end of 2006 while nonperforming assets as a percentage of finance assets increased to 134 from 128 respectively managed finance receivables include finance receivables that are owned and reported on our balance sheet along with securitized or sold finance receivables for which risks of ownership are retained to the extent of our subordinated interests in 2008 we expect continued growth in our managed finance receivables at a moderate pace and continued stability in our portfolio quality statistics 

  

the disruption in the credit market during the second half of 2007 had minimal impact on our finance segment’s ability to access the capital markets to refinance its maturing debt obligations and to fund growth in the finance receivable portfolio however this disruption in the credit markets did result in an increase in our borrowing costs the increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate “libor” the primary index against which our variablerate debt is priced and the federal funds rate had an 11 million negative impact on borrowing spreads this negative impact was almost completely mitigated by the issuances of new lower cost debt 

  

finance revenues 

  

revenues in the finance segment increased 77 million in 2007 compared with 2006 our revenue growth is primarily attributed to the following factors 

  

· higher average finance receivables of 722 million primarily due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses which resulted in additional revenues of 66 million 

· 21 million gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment and 

· 20 million increase in securitization income primarily related to a 588 million increase in the level of receivables sold into the distribution finance revolving securitization 

  

these increases were partially offset by the following decreases 

  

· 17 million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures 

· 13 million in lower leveraged lease earnings due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments and 

· 8 million reduction in leveraged lease earnings from the adoption of a new accounting standard 

  

revenues in the finance segment increased 170 million in 2006 compared with 2005 the increase was primarily due to a 103 million increase related to higher average finance receivables and a 90 million increase from the higher interest rate environment partially offset by an 18 million decrease in other income largely due to lower fees and securitization income average finance receivables increased 13 billion from levels in the corresponding period in 2005 primarily due to growth in the distribution golf and aviation finance businesses 

  

finance segment profit 

  

segment profit in the finance segment increased 12 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to a 30 million increase in net interest margin partially offset by an 11 million increase in selling and administrative expenses largely attributable to finance receivable portfolio growth and a 7 million increase in provision for loan losses reflecting an increase in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs in the distribution finance portfolio net interest margin increased due to a number of factors including the following 

  

· an increase of 56 million in securitization and other fee income as described above and 

· an increase of 30 million related to growth in average finance receivables 

· partially offset by a 17 million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures 

· lower leveraged lease earnings of 13 million due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments 

  

  

· higher borrowing costs of 11 million relative to the federal funds rate 

· a reduction in leveraged lease earnings of 8 million from the adoption of a new accounting standard and 

· lower leveraged lease earnings of 7 million due to a gain in 2006 on the sale of an option related to a leveraged lease asset 

  

segment profit in the finance segment increased 39 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due to an increase in net interest margin the growth in average finance receivables generated 54 million of higher net margin which was partially offset by an 18 million decrease in other income 

  

finance portfolio quality 

  

the following table presents information about the finance segment’s portfolio quality 

  

   

the finance segment’s portfolio quality continues to be strong as indicated by low rates of delinquency and nonperforming assets net chargeoffs as a percentage of average finance receivables also remain stable and relatively low at 045 during 2007 as compared with 038 and 051 during 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

nonperforming assets by business and as a percentage of the owned finance assets for each business are as follows 

  

   

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our manufacturing group we believe that nonperforming assets generally will be in the range of 1 to 4 of finance assets depending on economic conditions 

  

in 2007 the increases in nonperforming assets as a percentage of owned finance assets for assetbased lending and distribution finance compared with 2006 relate to weakening us economic conditions which began to have a negative impact on borrowers in certain industries 

  

in 2006 the 16 million increase in golf finance was primarily the result of two delinquent golf course mortgage loans whose operations were affected by the prolonged effects of hurricane katrina while the 10 million increase in assetbased lending is the result of two loans in unrelated industries 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell cessna and industrial segments while the finance group consists of the finance segment comprised of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

we assess liquidity for our manufacturing group in terms of our ability to provide adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows we also have liquidity available to us via committed bank lines of credit and the commercial paper market as well as access to the public capital markets that provide us with longterm capital at satisfactory terms 

  

for 2008 we expect future significant uses of cash for our manufacturing group to include investments in businesses and new product development capital expenditures repurchases of common stock dividends to shareholders and debt retirement for 2008 we expect capital expenditures of about 550 million and stock repurchases in the range of 3 million to 4 million shares we expect to fund both of these future uses of cash with cash generated by operating activities 

  

our finance group mitigates liquidity risk ie the risk that we will be unable to fund maturing liabilities or the origination of new finance receivables by developing and preserving reliable sources of capital we use a variety of financial resources to meet these capital needs cash for the finance group is provided from finance receivable collections sales and securitizations as well as the issuance of commercial paper and term debt in the public and private markets this diversity of capital resources enhances its funding flexibility limits dependence on any one source of funds and results in costeffective funding the finance group also can borrow from the manufacturing group when the availability of such borrowings creates an economic advantage to textron in comparison with borrowings from other sources in making particular funding decisions management considers market conditions prevailing interest rates and credit spreads and the maturity profile of its assets and liabilities 

  

on july 18 2007 our board of directors approved a twoforone split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend the additional shares resulting from the stock split were distributed on august 24 2007 to shareholders of record on august 3 2007 also on july 18 2007 our board of directors approved a 19 increase in our annualized common stock dividend rate from 0775 per share to 092 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to 24 million shares of our common stock the rate at which we expect to repurchase shares under this authorization will depend on various factors including prevailing share price and alternate uses of cash 

  

manufacturing group cash flows of continuing operations 

  

   

operating cash flows have increased over the past three years primarily due to earnings growth changes in our working capital components resulted in a 50 million use of cash in 2007 a 206 million source of cash in 2006 and a 21 million use of cash in 2005 a significant use of operating cash is related to increased production and inventory buildup primarily to support increasing sales at bell and cessna cash used for inventories totaled 473 million 379 million and 181 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively partially offsetting the use of cash for inventories and also related to increasing sales were customer deposits within accrued liabilities which provided a significant source of operating cash net cash received from customers on deposit totaled 297 million 141 million and 28 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

investing cash flows have largely been driven by cash outflows for acquisitions that totaled 11 billion in 2007 largely due to the acquisition of aai and 338 million in 2006 primarily due to overwatch systems other significant investing cash outflows include capital expenditures of 391 million in 2007 419 million in 2006 and 356 million in 2005 

  

we used 995 million less cash for financing activities in 2007 compared with 2006 the decrease is due principally to the issuance of 350 million in 10year notes in 2007 the paydown of 242 million of shortterm debt in 2006 and a 457 million decrease in 2007 in purchases of our common stock from 2006 in 2007 2006 and 2005 we repurchased approximately 6 million 17 million and 16 million shares of common stock respectively under boardauthorized share repurchase programs 

  

dividend payments to shareholders totaled 154 million 244 million and 189 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in three payments in 2007 five payments in 2006 and four payments in 2005 

  

  

  

finance group cash flows of continuing operations 

  

   

cash used for investing activities decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 largely due to a 774 million decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections a 481 million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations and the 164 million impact in 2006 of cash used for an acquisition proceeds from receivable sales increased primarily due to the sale of 588 million of receivables into the distribution finance revolving securitization in the first quarter of 2007 in 2006 more cash was used for investing activities resulting in higher net cash outflows for originations of 655 million primarily due to increased growth in the finance receivable portfolio partially offset by higher proceeds from receivable sales of 130 million 

  

the decrease in financing cash inflows in 2007 primarily reflects a reduction in borrowings due to lower managed receivable growth in comparison with 2006 in addition during 2007 we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables including securitizations to fund asset growth instead of additional borrowings in 2006 more cash was obtained from financing activities principally due to an increase in debt outstanding to fund asset growth 

  

consolidated cash flows of continuing operations 

  

  

   

operating cash flows have increased over the past three years primarily due to earnings growth other sources and uses of cash from operating activities are primarily related to our manufacturing group and are discussed in more detail within the “manufacturing group cash flows of continuing operations” section above 

  

cash used for investing activities decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 largely due to a 786 million decrease in finance receivable originations net of collections excluding 12 million from captive financing activities and a 424 million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations collections excluding 57 million from captive financing activities these decreases were partially offset by 590 million in higher cash outflows for acquisitions in 2007 we acquired four businesses including aai for a total outflow of 11 billion while in 2006 we acquired three businesses for 502 million including the overwatch systems and electrolux financial corporation acquisitions 

  

we received less cash from financing activities in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in borrowings largely a result of lower managed receivable growth in comparison with 2006 in addition during 2007 we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables including securitizations to fund asset growth instead of additional borrowings the decrease in cash borrowed by the finance group in 2007 from 2006 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of 350 million in 10year notes by the manufacturing group in 2007 a 457 million decrease in the purchases of our common stock and 90 million in lower dividend payments due to timing 

  

captive financing 

  

through our finance group we provide diversified commercial financing to third parties in addition this group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile in the manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

  

  

reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below 

  

   

consolidated discontinued operations cash flows 

  

   

discontinued operations cash flows in 2007 are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits in 2006 cash inflows from investing activities are primarily due to net cash proceeds of 636 million for the sale of the fastening systems business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning this sale 

  

capital resources 

  

the debt net of cashtocapital ratio for our manufacturing group as of december 29 2007 was 32 compared with 29 at december 30 2006 and the gross debttocapital ratio as of december 29 2007 was 38 compared with 40 at december 30 2006 

  

our manufacturing group targets a gross debttocapital ratio that is consistent with an a rated company consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community leverage of the manufacturing group excludes the debt of our finance group in turn our finance group limits its borrowings to an amount taking into account the risk profile of its assets consistent with a single a credit rating surplus capital of textron financial corporation is returned to textron inc 

  

borrowings historically have been a secondary source of funds for our manufacturing group and along with the collection of finance receivables are a primary source of funds for our finance group both borrowing groups utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flows and satisfy certain financial ratios since highquality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost we target a longterm a rating from the independent debtrating agencies the credit ratings and outlooks of these three debtrating agencies by borrowing group are as follows 

  

   

under separate shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission we may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of 20 billion and the finance group may issue an unlimited amount of public debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2007 we issued 350 million in 10year notes under our registration statement at december 29 2007 we had 12 billion available under our registration statement during 2007 the finance group issued 14 billion of term debt and cad 220 million of term debt under its registration statement in addition the finance group issued 300 million of 6 fixedtofloating rate junior subordinated notes which mature in 2067 the finance group has the right to redeem the notes at par beginning in 2017 and is obligated to redeem the notes beginning in 2042 

  

  

  

we have a policy of maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than outstanding commercial paper balances these facilities are in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only and neither of these lines of credit was drawn at december 29 2007 or december 30 2006 

  

our primary committed credit facilities at december 29 2007 include the following 

  

   

 the finance group is permitted to borrow under this multiyear facility 

  

in connection with the acquisition of aai we entered into an interim 750 million credit facility that was subsequently terminated in january 2008 

  

under a support agreement textron inc is required to maintain 100 ownership of textron financial corporation the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million 

  

contractual obligations 

  

manufacturing group 

  

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations of our manufacturing group as of december 29 2007 as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

 amounts exclude interest payments 

  

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years we also expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately 53 million to 73 million per year over the next five years which are not reflected in the above table 

  

other longterm liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2007 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience other longterm liabilities such as deferred taxes and unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 

  

  

  

operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of december 29 2007 the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

  

in january 2005 we contracted with a thirdparty service provider for the oversight of our information technology infrastructure including maintenance operational oversight and purchases of hardware the “it contract” the it contract covers a 10year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications we have retained the right to approve significant design equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider we can terminate the it contract for convenience prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed 46 million at december 29 2007 

  

finance group 

  

the following table summarizes our finance group’s known contractual obligations as defined by reporting regulations due to the nature of finance companies we also have contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future we generally borrow funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of our finance receivables the contractual payments and receipts as of december 29 2007 are detailed below 

  

   

finance receivable receipts related to finance leases and term loans are based on contractual cash flows while receipts related to revolving loans are based on historical cash flow experience these amounts could differ due to prepayments chargeoffs and other factors receipts and contractual payments exclude finance charges from receivables debt interest payments proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 

  

as shown in the preceding table our cash and receipts are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities for the next two years at december 29 2007 our finance group had 27 billion in debt and 406 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

at december 29 2007 our finance group had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under 16 billion of committed revolving lines of credit compared with 13 billion at december 30 2006 these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused we are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded 

  

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

performance guarantee 

  

in 2004 through our bell helicopter business we formed agustawestlandbell llc “awb llc” with agustawestland north america inc “awna” this venture was created for the joint design development manufacture sale customer training and product support of the vh71 helicopter and certain variations and derivatives thereof to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government in march 2005 awb llc received a 12 billion cost reimbursementtype subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49 of awb llc’s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract agustawestland nv awna’s parent company has guaranteed the remaining 51 to lockheed martin we have entered into crossindemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s workshare under any subcontracts received awb llc’s maximum obligation is 50 of the total contract value which equates to 613 million for a maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee of 300 million at december 29 2007 through completion 

  

finance receivable sales and securitizations 

  

our finance group sells finance receivables utilizing both wholeloan sales and securitizations primarily utilizing assetbacked securitization structures as a result of these transactions finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments these retained interests are more fully discussed in the “securitizations” section of note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we utilize these offbalance sheet financing arrangements to further diversify funding alternatives these arrangements provided net proceeds of 731 million 50 million and 361 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and net pretax gains of 62 million 42 million and 49 million respectively proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold into a revolving conduit and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these shortduration receivables 

  

as of december 29 2007 our finance group had two significant offbalance sheet financing arrangements the distribution finance revolving securitization trust and the aviation finance securitization trust the distribution finance revolving securitization trust is a master trust that purchases inventory finance receivables from the finance group and issues assetbacked notes to investors the distribution finance revolving securitization trust had 20 billion of onemonth liborbased variablerate assetbacked notes outstanding as of december 29 2007 these notes each have a threeyear term and mature in may 2008 2009 and 2010 the aviation finance securitization trust purchases finance leases and installment contracts secured by general aviation aircraft this trust is funded through a commercial paper conduit commitment of a 600 million revolving credit facility which expires in december 2008 as of december 31 2007 the aviation securitization trust had 433 million outstanding under its facility the amount of pretax gains recorded upon the ongoing sale of receivables in these arrangements and the value of our subordinated interest are impacted by the pricing of the investor notes issued by the distribution finance securitization trust and the interest rate obtained by the commercial paper conduit which funds the aviation finance securitization trust the trusts have not experienced any material disruption to their funding however the commercial paper conduit which provides funding to the aviation finance securitization trust did experience an increase in borrowing spreads in 2007 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

allowance for losses on finance receivables 

  

our allowance for losses on finance receivables is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values among other factors therefore changes in economic conditions or credit metrics including past due and nonperforming accounts or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may require additions or reductions to our reserves 

  

  

  

for homogeneous loan pools we examine current delinquencies characteristics of the existing accounts historical loss experience underlying collateral value and general economic conditions and trends we estimate losses will range from 03 to 60 of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool for larger balance commercial loans we also consider borrower specific information industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows our process involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment while we believe that our consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses the allowance for losses on finance receivables currently represents 103 of total finance receivables during the last five years net chargeoffs as a percentage of average finance receivables have ranged from 038 to 208 

  

longterm contracts 

  

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we account for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

  

under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and cost of a contract we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the costtocost method which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the unitsofdelivery method which is used for production effort as appropriate under the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

  

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

goodwill 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 using the estimates from our longterm strategic plans no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 

  

goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions if different assumptions were used in these forecasts the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different potentially resulting in an impairment charge the impact of reducing our fair value estimates by 10 would have no impact on our goodwill assessment with the exception of our fluid handling products “fhp” and golf  turfcare “gt” components assuming a 10 reduction in our fair value estimates the carrying value of these components may approximate or exceed fair value 

  

  

  

  

our operating plans and projections anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures at our fhp component to capture additional business in the oil and gas markets during 2007 fhp achieved revenue growth of 20 and operating profit growth of approximately 25 we anticipate continued sales growth over the fiveyear planning period as well as operating margin improvements should the revenue growth rates and operating margins over the planning period approximate historical levels the estimated fair value would be reduced by up to approximately 50 million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at december 29 2007 the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately 216 million 

  

our operating plans and projections for our gt component anticipate operating margin improvements over the fiveyear planning period resulting in high singledigit margins and assume annual revenue growth of approximately 4 a 100basispoint decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately 35 million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at december 29 2007 the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately 141 million 

  

retirement benefits 

  

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increases we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 

  

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2007 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 853 compared with 854 in 2006 in 2007 and 2006 the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans which represent approximately 88 of our total pension assets was 874 and 875 respectively a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return would result in a 22 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2007 the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 559 compared with 555 in 2006 for our qualified domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 566 in 2007 compared with 565 for 2006 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate would result in a 34 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2007 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2007 medical rate of 8 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2015 and then remain at that level the 2007 prescription drug rate of 12 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2015 and then remain at that level see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

warranty liabilities 

  

we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs including parts and labor for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses we also may incur costs related to product recalls 

  

we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold historical costs per claim contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims including production and warranty patterns for new models during our initial aircraft model launches we typically incur higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate 

  

  

we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 

  

securitized transactions 

  

securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts we may retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of interestonly securities seller certificates cash reserve accounts and servicing rights and obligations at the time of sale a gain or loss is recorded based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the finance receivables sold the allocated carrying value is determined based on the relative fair values of the finance receivables sold and the interests retained as such the fair value estimate of the retained interests has a direct impact on the gain or loss recorded we estimate fair value based on the present value of future cash flows expected under management’s best estimates of key assumptions – credit losses prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved retained interests are recorded at fair value as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

we review the fair values of the retained interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the carrying value of the retained interests when the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the retained interests we determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary when we determine the value of the decline is other than temporary we write down the retained interests to fair value with a corresponding charge to income when a change in fair value of the retained interests is deemed temporary we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses a hypothetical adverse change of 10 and 20 to the expected credit losses residual cash flows discount rates or prepayment rate assumptions would not have a material impact on the current value of the residual cash flows associated with the retained interests hypothetical sensitivities should be used with caution as the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality a change in one factor may magnify or counteract the sensitivities losses for example increases in interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses 

  

income taxes 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss as appropriate 

  

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we record the amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information interest and penalties are accrued where applicable if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit is recognized however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risks 

  

our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt and vice versa the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate debt we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixedrate debt and adjust the mix as necessary based on our evaluation of internal and external factors the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2007 2006 or 2005 

  

our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at december 29 2007 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 51 million net of 23 billion of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixedrate debt to a floatingrate equivalent interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our finance group by 25 million in 2007 and 27 million in 2006 and decreasing interest expense by 11 million in 2005 

  

foreign exchange risks 

  

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured andor sold for 2007 the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2006 increased revenues by approximately 148 million 13 and increased segment profit by approximately 12 million 09 

  

for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 

  

in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately 12 billion at the end of 2007 and 765 million at the end of 2006 

  

quantitative risk measures 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts 

  

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a 10 decrease in the quoted market price of the marketable equity security 

  

  

 

 the value represents an asset or liability

the 2006 yearend backlog with the major fractional jet customer was approximately 14 billion the remaining 71 billion of cessna’s backlog at the end of 2006 is with other commercial customers covering a wide spectrum of industries this backlog includes 10 billion in orders for the new citation cj4 aircraft with the first customer deliveries in 2010 

approximately 50 of our total backlog of 134 billion at december 30 2006 represents orders which are not expected to be filled within our 2007 fiscal year 

us government contracts

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impact our business financial condition and results of operations perhaps materially 

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which sometimes are contractually obligated in some cases we are able to offset these reductions through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

delays in aircraft delivery schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect our financial results 

aircraft customers including sellers of fractional share interests may respond to weak economic conditions by delaying delivery of orders or canceling orders weakness in the economy also may result in fewer hours flown on existing aircraft and consequently lower demand for spare parts and maintenance weak economic conditions also may cause reduced demand for used business jets or helicopters we may accept used aircraft on tradein that would be subject to fluctuations in the fair market value of the aircraft while in inventory reduced demand for new and used aircraft spare parts and maintenance can have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft products and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected 

we have customer concentration with the us government 

during 2006 we derived approximately 19 of our revenues from sales to a variety of us government entities our ability to compete successfully for and retain this business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel us government programs are subject to uncertain future funding levels which can result in the extension or termination of programs our business also is highly sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and us government budgets 

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 

if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced in accordance with contract terms by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor 

in addition to these termination provisions our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials 

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs 

include expected increases in wages and prices for materials incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance estimates of award fees also are used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 

because of the significance of the estimates described above it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial results of operations 

under fixedprice contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under cost reimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

we may enter into acquisitions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses and the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations 

our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control 

our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders in addition we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers and even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations 

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

approximately 18000 of our employees are unionized which represented approximately 45 of our employees at december 30 2006 as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

in addition to our workforce the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

our finance borrowing group’s business is dependent on its continuing access to the capital markets 

our financings are conducted through two borrowing groups finance and manufacturing our finance group consists of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries which are the entities through which we operate in the finance segment our finance group relies on its access to the capital markets to fund asset growth fund operations and meet debt obligations and other commitments this group raises funds through commercial paper borrowings issuances of mediumterm notes and other term debt securities and syndication and securitization of receivables additional liquidity is provided to our finance group through bank lines of credit much of the capital markets funding is made possible by the maintenance of credit ratings that are acceptable to investors if the credit ratings of our finance group were to be lowered it might face higher borrowing costs a disruption of its access to the capital markets or both our finance group also could lose access to financing for other reasons such as a general disruption of the capital markets any disruption of our finance group’s access to the capital markets could adversely affect its business and our profitability 

if our finance group is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a key determinant of financial performance of our finance group will be its ability to maintain the quality of loans leases and other credit products in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may adversely be affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality geographic or industry concentrations or general economic downturns any inability by our finance group to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem accounts may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to private sector transactions government contracts compliance with applicable laws and regulations production partners product liability employment and environmental safety and health matters under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

in addition to reserves at our finance group we establish reserves in our manufacturing group to cover uncollectible accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers 

in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable 

the effect on our financial results of many of these factors depends in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering potential losses at reasonable rates 

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our pension plans which are dependent on actual plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of plan benefit obligations 

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

on december 30 2006 we operated a total of 77 plants located throughout the us and 60 plants outside the us of the total of 137 plants we owned 69 and the balance were leased in the aggregate the total manufacturing space was approximately 229 million square feet 

we also own or lease offices warehouse and other space at various locations we consider the productive capacity of the plants operated by each of our business segments to be adequate in general our facilities are in good condition are considered to be adequate for the uses to which they are being put and are substantially in regular use 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

two identical lawsuits purporting to be class actions were filed in 2002 in the united states district court in rhode island against textron and certain present and former officers of textron and bell helicopter by textron shareholders suing on their own behalf and on behalf of a purported class of textron shareholders a consolidated amended complaint alleged that the defendants failed to make certain accounting adjustments in response to alleged problems with bell helicopter’s v22 and h1 programs and that the company failed to timely write down certain assets of its omniquip unit the complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages on june 15 2004 the district court ruled that the plaintiffs could not maintain the claims that were based on allegations relating to the h1 program or to omniquip and also ruled that all claims against one of the individual defendants should be dismissed the district court certified the class of shareholders on may 11 2005 all claims in the litigation were subsequently settled for a cash amount that was paid by textron’s insurer the settlement received final approval of the district court on december 13 2006 and the matter has been concluded 

we are subject to actual and threatened legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business these proceedings include claims arising from private transactions government contracts product liability employment and environmental safety and health matters some of these legal proceedings seek damages fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our suspension or debarment from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we believe that these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview and outlook 

we had a strong year in 2006 with many notable accomplishments across the enterprise from a financial perspective revenues earnings and operating cash flows from continuing operations were all up significantly despite the challenges at bell with the h1 upgrade and armed reconnaissance helicopter “arh” programs from a portfolio perspective we completed several strategic actions to strengthen our product mix 

our continued focus on the generation and support of organic growth through strong investments in engineering research and development and capacity expansion were evident across the enterprise for example at bell helicopter our reinvigorated commercial line contributed to a 30 increase in commercial deliveries in 2006 and we are optimistic about continued helicopter growth in large part due to the market’s enthusiasm for our recently introduced 429 model 

new products at cessna also are generating extraordinary customer interest and expanding the scope of our market this year we introduced two additions to our line of citation jets the xls and the cj4 we also were the first to certify and deliver a jet the mustang in the new entrylevel jet category for the year we booked 496 new jet orders which demonstrates the strength of our product line and the market in general 

some of the more notable financial highlights for 2006 include 

revenues increased 14 to 115 billon in 2006 primarily driven by growth in our aerospace defense and finance businesses our organic growth rate which excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions was 15

earnings per share from continuing operations increased 44 to 543 the combination of higher revenues and our ongoing costcontainment and operational efficiency initiatives along with a decrease in the average of diluted common shares outstanding translated into a growth rate more than triple our revenue growth rate

operating cash flows from our manufacturing businesses increased by 25 to 11 billion with our strong operating cash flows and solid balance sheet we were able to make strategic business acquisitions and return value to our shareholders as follows

·   we repurchased 86 million shares of our common stock for 751 million

·   we increased our dividend by 015 per share to 155 per share resulting in total dividend payments of 244 million

·   we added two companies innovative survivability technologies and overwatch systems to our defense business for 338 million

·   we acquired a distribution finance business from electrolux in our finance segment for 164 million

commercial backlog increased 32 to 98 billion primarily related to cessna in addition our us government backlog increased 6 to 35 billion primarily in the bell segment

we received 644 million in proceeds related to the disposition of noncore manufacturing businesses these dispositions include the sale of our fastening systems business and jacobsen’s commercial grounds care business

 

   diluted earnings per share and manufacturing cash provided by operating activities are for continuing operations only 

outlook 

looking ahead we expect 2007 revenues in excess of 12 billion with growth led by our aerospace and defense businesses we expect strong growth in business jet deliveries as we deliver against our record backlog and respond to increasing global demand we also are preparing to deliver more commercial helicopters in 2007 as we execute against backlog in this market our defense businesses are expected to remain strong as we continue to support the us government’s efforts in iraq and elsewhere we expect segment profit to increase reflecting improvements in each of the manufacturing segments 

consolidated results of operations 

revenues 

in 2006 our revenues increased 15 billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of 10 billion higher pricing of 274 million and higher revenues in the finance segment of 170 million in 2005 revenues increased 17 billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of 13 billion higher pricing of 159 million additional revenues of 115 million from acquisitions and higher revenues in the finance segment of 83 million 

segment profit 

in 2006 our segment profit increased 121 million primarily due to higher pricing of 274 million higher sales volume of 198 million improved cost performance of 54 million in the industrial segment favorable warranty performance at cessna of 39 million and higher profit in the finance segment of 39 million these increases were partially offset by inflation of 272 million higher spending for engineering and new product development of 74 million higher overhead of 55 million in bell’s commercial business and increased charges related to the h1 low rate initial production “lrip” contracts of 68 million in 2005 segment profit increased 296 million primarily due to higher sales volume of 319 million higher pricing of 159 million and higher profit in the finance segment of 26 million these increases were partially offset by inflation of 227 million 

special charges 

special charges totaled 118 million for 2005 and included 112 million in charges related to the 2001 disposition of the automotive trim business “trim” and 6 million in restructuring expense in the industrial segment in 2004 special charges totaled 59 million and included 71 million in restructuring expense principally in the industrial segment partially offset by a 12 million gain on the sale of common stock acquired in connection with the trim disposition 

in connection with the disposition of trim to subsidiaries of collins  aikman corporation “ca” we acquired preferred stock in ca products co “ca products” and ca common stock in the first quarter of 2005 we recorded a 52 million impairment charge to write down the preferred stock based on an agreement to sell the stock to a third party in the second quarter of 2005 based on ca products’ filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and relevant market considerations we wrote off the remaining book value of the preferred stock of 39 million 

in connection with the trim disposition our finance group has recourse to our manufacturing group for equipment leases with the subsidiaries of ca the outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately 61 million at december 30 2006 based on uncertainties related to these leases our manufacturing group recorded a 10 million reserve to special charges in the fourth quarter of 2005 

certain other operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of ca upon the sale of trim as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we guaranteed ca’s payments under these operating leases and for an environmental matter in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on ca’s failure to pay certain leases as well as the negotiations entered into at the time for the sale of ca’s european operations we recorded an 11 million charge to special charges to cover our exposure under these leases along with certain environmental and workers’ compensation matters 

we substantially completed our companywide restructuring program at the end of 2005 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this program in 2005 we recorded 6 million in restructuring expense under the program for severance and other associated costs in 2004 we recorded 71 million in restructuring expense under the program with 37 million in contract termination costs 28 million in severance costs and 6 million in other associated costs we have approximately 30 million in restructuring reserves remaining at the end of 2006 primarily related to contract termination costs for one lease in the industrial segment which will be paid out over the next 13 years 

corporate expenses and other net 

corporate expenses and other net increased 3 million in 2006 principally due to 7 million of higher sharebased compensation expense and 4 million of higher incentive compensation partially offset by 8 million of lower expenses related to corporate initiatives 

corporate expenses and other net increased 42 million in 2005 principally due to 16 million for higher compensation and pension costs 9 million for corporate initiatives and 7 million for the corporate portion of sharebased compensation expense recorded upon the adoption of a new accounting standard 

income taxes 

a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is provided below 

   

discontinued operations

operating results of these discontinued businesses primarily related to fastening systems are as follows 

   

in 2005 the loss from discontinued operations includes a 335 million goodwill impairment charge related to our fastening systems business in addition we recorded an aftertax charge of approximately 52 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 which included 37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and 7 million in curtailment losses for employee retirement plans after these charges we assessed the estimated fair value of the business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was required at that time in the second quarter of 2006 we recorded an additional 120 million aftertax impairment charge to record the business at the estimated fair value less cost to sell at the time based on offers received from potential purchasers 

in 2005 we recorded a net 46 million gain on disposal primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of intesys

each segment’s revenues and profit as a percentage of consolidated revenues and profit are provided below 

 

  

bell 

   

bell helicopter currently is in the early stages of development or production for a number of government and commercial programs that are anticipated to significantly drive revenue and profit growth in future years government programs generally follow a threephase cycle consisting of development transition to production and fullrate production rampup each phase has specific risks and operational challenges over the next few years bell helicopter’s major government programs will be transitioning through various phases of this cycle 

bell helicopter programs with the us government include the v22 military tiltrotor aircraft the h1 upgrade program and the arh program the v22 program is in fullrate production and delivered 16 aircraft in 2006 the h1 upgrade program is in the transition to production phase and the arh program is in the system development and demonstration “sdd” phase 

in 2006 we made significant investments to conduct research and development transition development contracts to production increase our production capacity and implement improved operational systems to manage anticipated growth in bell helicopter’s programs these investments have negatively impacted our financial results and include significant ongoing production rampup primarily for the v22 program ongoing development efforts related primarily to the 429 model and the arh program and the h1’s transition to production 

the costs of investing in improved operational systems resulted in higher overhead expenses during 2006 while these higher overhead costs have been reflected in lower 2006 earnings in the commercial business a portion of these costs have been absorbed into overhead in the government business due to the relatively long production cycle particularly into v22 production inventory the overhead costs are anticipated to moderate in 2007 however as v22 aircraft currently in production are delivered in future periods the 2006 overhead expenses reflected in inventory will result in lower margins on these shipments 

textron systems has continued to experience strong growth in its us government business delivering 471 armored security vehicles “asv” in 2006 to support our troops in iraq and elsewhere during 2006 textron systems added to its offerings to the defense industry by acquiring two businesses innovative survivability technologies and overwatch systems 

bell revenues 

us government business 

in 2006 revenues increased 376 million compared with 2005 primarily due to higher net volume and mix of 343 million and the benefit from acquisitions of 28 million the volume increase is primarily due to higher asv deliveries of 286 million higher arh sdd development revenue of 94 million increased spares and service sales of 37 million and additional intelligent battlefield systems volume of 22 million partially offset by lower v22 volume of 80 million and lower h1 revenue of 18 million 

in 2005 revenues increased 491 million compared with 2004 primarily due to higher revenue of 288 million from the v22 program higher asv volume of 61 million the benefit of 36 million from the us helicopter acquisition higher military spares volume of 32 million and increased sales of 20 million for airlaunched weapons additionally bell recognized 21 million on the arh sdd contract 

commercial business 

in 2006 commercial revenues increased 151 million compared with 2005 due to higher volume of 105 million and pricing of 46 million the volume increase is primarily due to higher civil aircraft deliveries of 176 million higher spares and service sales of 53 million and additional deliveries of huey ii kits of 10 million partially offset by lower international military deliveries of 116 million 

in 2005 commercial revenues increased 136 million compared with 2004 primarily due to higher aircraft sales of 68 million higher spares volume of 41 million and higher international military sales of 26 million international military sales increased primarily due to higher asv deliveries to foreign customers of 58 million partially offset by lower helicopter volume of 32 million 

bell segment profit 

us government business 

in 2006 profit in our us government business decreased 25 million compared with 2005 the decrease was primarily due to inflation of 33 million and unfavorable cost performance of 24 million partially offset by the impact of higher net volume and mix of 35 million the unfavorable performance reflected higher anticipated costs for the h1 lrip contracts of 68 million and charges of 14 million related to the arh sdd contract partially offset by favorable program performance at textron systems of 34 million primarily related to hurricane katrina 

in 2005 profit in our us government business increased 33 million compared with 2004 the increase was principally due to higher v22 volume of 26 million reflecting the delivery of 12 aircraft from lots 7 and 8 higher volume and improved performance of airlaunched weapons totaling 13 million and increased asv deliveries and improved performance of 10 million these increases were partially offset by 18 million of costs associated with hurricane katrina 

h1 program – the h1 program continues in development and currently is undergoing its operational evaluation we also entered into three firm fixedprice lrip contracts with the us government under this program that represent the first h1 program production aircraft in addition a firm fixedprice option exists for a fourth production lot during the transition to production phase we anticipate incurring costs in excess of contractual reimbursement on the first two h1 lrip contracts we anticipate that once the initial h1 lrip aircraft are delivered and the production operations are validated costs will moderate as the production configuration is stabilized production inefficiencies are resolved and learning curve improvements are realized

during 2006 we estimated that the costs to complete h1 lrip lot 1 would exceed contractual reimbursement through the third quarter of 2006 we recorded 29 million in charges related to the h1 lrip lot 1 contract these charges primarily reflected the impact of higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements and higher anticipated efforts in final assembly at the end of the third quarter we had anticipated that acceptance of the initial h1 lrip lot 1 aircraft by the us government would occur in the fourth quarter of 2006 however acceptance was delayed and no aircraft were delivered this delay was due to changes in the development and engineering requirements that were identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing due to this delay and the costs associated with the additional development efforts rework of inprocess units and resulting inefficiencies we increased our estimate of the completion costs in the fourth quarter accordingly we recorded an additional 20 million charge related to the h1 lrip lot 1 contract in the fourth quarter of 2006 in january 2007 the us government accepted two aircraft and we expect the remaining seven h1 lrip lot 1 units to be accepted later in 2007 

the h1 lrip lot 2 contract is in the early stages of production with first aircraft delivery anticipated in the second half of 2007 we now anticipate that the disruption and delays experienced with the h1 lrip lot 1 contract in the fourth quarter will result in increased costs for the h1 lrip lot 2 contract due to delays in its completion as well as a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements due to these higher cost estimates the h1 lrip lot 2 contract now is in a loss position resulting in a fourth quarter charge of 33 million 

the net h1 program charge including favorable performance on the engineering and manufacturing development contract of 3 million was 50 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 

arh program – the arh sdd contract is a cost plus incentive fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract costs increase during 2006 we continued our development activities for this program and expensed 14 million in unreimbursed costs related to this effort we continue to work with the us government on development issues configuration changes and schedule requirements we no longer are eligible to earn fees under this contract however we anticipate that any subsequent cost increases are reimbursable by the us government

the us government had two firm fixedprice options under this program representing the first two lrip lots for the delivery of 24 to 48 aircraft certain development requirements under the arh sdd contract must be met before the us government can exercise the options we presently anticipate that the development requirements will be met in mid2007 the option for the first lrip lot for 612 aircraft has expired while the option for the second lot for 1836 aircraft expires in december 2007 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed certain phases of the critical design review under the arh sdd contract and determined the initial production configuration of the aircraft which includes aircraft configuration changes required by the us government our cost estimates based on this configuration which include anticipated transition to production costs exceed the fixed pricing contained in the options we currently are in discussions with the us government related to the possible reinstatement of the arh lot 1 option extension of the options delivery schedule number of units to be exercised under the options and possible additional aircraft to be contracted in addition to those under the options at revised pricing we also are reviewing our ability to claim equitable adjustment recovery from the us government related to certain costs that potentially could be incurred related to the exercise of these options 

depending on the results of the sdd contract our costcontainment efforts the availability of us government funding the number of aircraft exercised or ultimately contracted for and the resolution of our discussions with the us government we currently estimate that it is reasonably possible that our exposure could be in the range of no loss to a possible loss of 4 million per aircraft this estimate excludes the impact of discussions with the us government or any potential recoveries including claims for equitable adjustment under the contracts due to the uncertainty of this exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions we do not believe that a loss is probable under the guidelines established by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no5 “accounting for contingencies” accordingly we have not established a reserve at december 30 2006 

commercial business 

in 2006 commercial profit decreased 94 million compared with 2005 primarily due to unfavorable cost performance of 140 million and inflation of 28 million partially offset by higher pricing of 46 million and the impact of increased volume and mix of 42 million the unfavorable cost performance reflected increased overhead costs of 55 million the impact of the 30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab139 program in 2005 higher net research and development expense of 29 million and the 13 million prior year impact of the resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a collaborative research and development agreement partially offset by 18 million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in 2005 for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 

in 2005 commercial profit increased 85 million compared with 2004 primarily due to the 30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab139 helicopter program the 29 million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance higher spares volume of 22 million and a 13 million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement in addition commercial profit reflected a 16 million decrease in net research and development as higher gross research and development expenses of 28 million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risksharing agreements from codevelopment partners these increases were partially offset by 28 million of higher selling and administrative expense and 18 million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in 2005 for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 

cessna 

   

demand in the business jet market continued to strengthen in 2006 which was reflected in a 34 increase in our backlog despite a 22 increase in business jet deliveries over the past three years cessna has increased its annual production rate and has continued to focus on improving margins while investing in engineering research and development in cessna’s continual effort to bring new technology and products to market citation business jets are the largest component of cessna’s revenues we delivered 307 252 and 179 citation business jets in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively representing 77 76 and 72 of cessna’s total revenues 

cessna revenues 

revenues at cessna increased 676 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due to higher volume of 493 million primarily related to citation business jets and favorable pricing of 183 million in 2005 cessna’s revenues increased 10 billion compared with 2004 primarily due to higher citation business jet volume of 737 million higher pricing of 82 million and a benefit from the consolidation of citationshares of 78 million 

cessna segment profit 

segment profit increased 188 million at cessna in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pricing of 183 million the impact of higher volume of 102 million and favorable warranty performance of 39 million partially offset by inflation of 112 million and higher engineering and product development costs of 41 million favorable warranty performance included the 24 million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2006 as well as a 15 million incremental benefit from other favorable warranty performance in 2006 a 33 million benefit in 2006 compared with 18 million in 2005 

during initial model launches cessna typically incurs higher warrantyrelated costs until the production process matures at which point warranty costs moderate based on historical production and warranty patterns management estimated that the sovereign and cj3 production lines had reached this maturity level and that sovereign and cj3 aircraft produced in the third and fourth quarter of 2006 would incur lower warranty costs than earlier production aircraft in 2006 cessna’s profit improved by approximately 24 million as a result of lower point of sale warranty costs for aircraft sold during the year primarily sovereign and cj3 compared with 2005 management expects improved performance on these models to continue in the foreseeable future 

in 2005 cessna’s segment profit increased 190 million compared to 2004 largely due to the 229 million impact of higher volume across all product lines and 82 million of higher pricing partially offset by 99 million of inflation 

industrial 

   

the industrial segment is composed of five businesses including ezgo jacobsen kautex greenlee and fluid  power during 2006 we experienced positive organic growth in each of this segment’s businesses as we continued to focus on our customers both fluid  power and kautex increased their presence in china to capitalize on the expanding market greenlee prepared to launch their new hand tool product line to complement their existing products in our golf and turf care businesses we completed the sale of our commercial grounds care business allowing us to focus on our core golf resort sport turf and municipal markets 

industrial revenues 

revenues in the industrial segment increased 74 million in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to higher volume of 89 million higher pricing of 46 million and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 10 million partially offset by the divestiture of noncore product lines of 72 million 

revenues in the industrial segment increased 8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 as higher pricing of 36 million and favorable foreign exchange of 31 million were largely offset by lower volume of 63 million the lower sales volume primarily reflected decreases of 80 million at kautex largely due to product model changeovers and 39 million at jacobsen primarily related to the strategic realignment of its north american commercial distribution network these decreases were partially offset by higher volume of 31 million at greenlee 

industrial segment profit 

segment profit in the industrial segment increased 13 million in 2006 compared with 2005 mainly due to 54 million of improved cost performance higher pricing of 46 million and the 24 million impact of higher net volume and mix partially offset by 100 million of inflation and a 7 million impact from divestitures of noncore product lines 

segment profit in the industrial segment decreased 44 million in 2005 compared with 2004 largely due to inflation of 84 million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of 21 million partially offset by higher pricing of 36 million and improved cost performance of 24 million primarily at kautex 

finance 

   

during 2006 the finance segment generated significant growth in its owned and managed finance receivables owned finance receivables grew by 15 billion up 23 from 2005 and we expect continued growth in 2007 portfolio quality statistics reflected continued improvements in 2006 our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total finance assets decreased to 128 at the end of 2006 compared with 153 at the end of 2005 and 218 at the end of 2004 while portfolio quality statistics continue to improve the collectibility of this segment’s finance receivable portfolio remains one of its most significant business risks the continued strength of our portfolio quality combined with continued reductions in the level of loan losses resulted in a reduction of the rate utilized to establish the allowance for losses in several of our portfolios in 2006 this resulted in a 7 million reduction in the provision for losses during 2006 we expect relative stability in our portfolio statistics during 2007 

finance revenues 

revenues in the finance segment increased 170 million in 2006 compared with 2005 the increase was primarily due to a 103 million increase related to higher average finance receivables and a 90 million increase from the higher interest rate environment partially offset by an 18 million decrease in other income largely due to lower fees and securitization income average finance receivables increased 13 billion from levels in the corresponding period in 2005 primarily due to growth in the distribution golf and aviation finance businesses 

revenues in the finance segment increased 83 million in 2005 compared with 2004 the increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of 95 million partially offset by lower prepayment income of 10 million the increase in finance charges was largely due to a higher interest rate environment which accounted for 98 million of the increase and 62 million related to higher average finance receivables of 855 million partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of 65 million the increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution golf and aviation finance and assetbased lending partially offset by reductions in liquidating noncore portfolios 

finance segment profit 

segment profit in the finance segment increased 39 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due to an increase in net interest margin the growth in average finance receivables generated 54 million of higher net margin which was partially offset by an 18 million decrease in other income 

segment profit in the finance segment increased 32 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to a 29 million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality and an 18 million increase in net interest margin which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of 15 million the increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to 9 million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and 5 million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost 

finance portfolio quality 

the following table presents information about the finance segment’s portfolio quality 

   

nonperforming assets by business are as follows 

   

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our manufacturing group we believe that nonperforming assets generally will be in the range of 1 to 4 of finance assets depending on economic conditions in 2006 the 16 million increase in golf finance is primarily the result of two delinquent golf course mortgage loans whose operations were affected by the prolonged effects of hurricane katrina while the 10 million increase in assetbased lending is the result of two loans in unrelated industries the 27 million improvement in resort finance and the liquidating portfolios in 2006 principally reflected chargeoffs against existing reserves and remedial collection activity in 2005 nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to resort and golf finance reflecting improvement in general economic conditions partially offset by an increase in our liquidating portfolios due to two loans the noncore liquidating portfolios continue to compose a disproportionate amount of the nonperforming assets accounting for 29 of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than 2 of the total finance assets at december 30 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell cessna and industrial segments while the finance group consists of the finance segment comprised of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group our manufacturing group operations include the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services while our finance group provides financial services due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities investors rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance to support those evaluations we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 

through our finance group we provide diversified commercial financing to third parties in addition this group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group otherwise known as captive financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received however in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group for example when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer that is financed by the finance group the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow on our finance group’s statement of cash flows meanwhile the manufacturing group records the cash received from the finance group on the customer’s behalf within operating cash flows as a cash inflow on our manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing these captive financing activities along with all significant intercompany transactions are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows as detailed below in the operating cash flows of continuing operations section 

under a support agreement textron inc is required to maintain 100 ownership of textron financial corporation the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million 

operating cash flows of continuing operations 

   

cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for our operating needs dividends and capital expenditures we analyze operating cash flows for our manufacturing group by tracking free cash flow we calculate free cash flow using net cash provided by operating activities adding back proceeds on the sale of property plant and equipment then subtracting capital expenditures including those financed with capital leases 

the manufacturing group’s operating cash flows increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations and a decrease in working capital components consolidated operating cash flows increased primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations for both borrowing groups and a decrease in working capital components partially offset by a 224 million increase in net captive financing activity as explained below 

reclassification and elimination adjustments 

   

finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to financings related to aircraft sales growth during the period however cash received for these captive receivables decreased in 2006 as higher cash receipts from our customers were offset by 126 million in lower proceeds from securitizations 

investing cash flows of continuing operations 

   

over the past three years consolidated investing cash flows have been largely driven by increases in cash outflows at our finance group due to higher noncaptive finance receivable originations net of cash collections from repayments sales and securitizations of 301 million 198 million and 744 million respectively 

the 380 million increase in cash used for the manufacturing group in 2006 is largely due to the acquisition of two businesses in the bell segment for 338 million in cash along with an increase in capital expenditures of 63 million in 2005 the manufacturing group increased its use of cash for investing by 204 million with 118 million in higher capital expenditures along with a 38 million decrease in proceeds that were received in 2004 from the sale of ca common stock the increases in capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 are primarily related to higher spending at the bell segment in response to increased production demands capital expenditures related to our manufacturing operations totaled 435 million in 2006 371 million in 2005 and 282 million in 2004 including expenditures purchased through capital leases of 16 million in 2006 15 million in 2005 and 44 million in 2004 

financing cash flows of continuing operations 

   

our manufacturing group used 669 million more cash for financing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 the increase is primarily due to the paydown of 242 million of shortterm debt in 2006 compared with the issuance of 281 million of shortterm debt in 2005 and to a 164 million increase in purchases of our common stock our manufacturing group used less cash for financing activities in 2005 than in 2004 principally due to the issuance of the shortterm debt in 2005 and the retirement of debt of 300 million in 2004 partially offset by a 182 million increase in purchases of our common stock and 81 million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans our finance group has continued to increase its debt outstanding over the past three years to fund asset growth 

stock repurchases 

in 2006 2005 and 2004 we repurchased approximately 8574000 8035000 and 6534000 shares of common stock respectively under boardauthorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of 751 million 606 million and 425 million respectively on january 26 2006 our board of directors authorized a new 12 millionshare repurchase program of which 44 million shares remained at december 30 2006 

dividends 

on january 26 2006 the board of directors authorized a 015 per share increase in our annualized common stock dividend to 155 per share dividend payments to shareholders totaled 244 million 189 million and 135 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in five payments in 2006 four payments in 2005 and three payments in 2004 

discontinued operations cash flows 

   

discontinued operations cash flows from investing activities increased in 2006 primarily due to net cash proceeds of 636 million related to the sale of the fastening systems business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning our discontinued operations 

capital resources 

the debt net of cashtocapital ratio for our manufacturing group as of december 30 2006 was 29 compared with 26 at december 31 2005 and the gross debttocapital ratio as of december 30 2006 was 40 compared with 37 at december 30 2005 the 2006 ratio reflects the adoption of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement nos 87 88 106 132r” our manufacturing group targets a gross debttocapital ratio that is consistent with an a rated company consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community leverage of the manufacturing group excludes the debt of our finance group in turn our finance group limits its borrowings to an amount taking into account the risk profile of its assets consistent with a single a credit rating surplus capital of textron financial corporation is returned to textron inc 

borrowings historically have been a secondary source of funds for our manufacturing group and along with the collection of finance receivables are a primary source of funds for our finance group both borrowing groups utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flows and satisfy certain financial ratios since highquality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost we target a longterm a rating from the independent debtrating agencies the credit ratings and outlooks of these three debtrating agencies by borrowing group are as follows 

   

we have a policy of maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than outstanding commercial paper balances these facilities are in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only and neither of these primary lines of credit was drawn at december 30 2006 or december 31 2005 

our primary committed credit facilities at december 30 2006 include the following 

   

 the finance group is permitted to borrow under this multiyear facility 

under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the manufacturing group may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of 20 billion at december 30 2006 we had 16 billion available under the manufacturing group’s registration statement 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 the finance group renewed a previously filed statement to enable it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt our finance group issued 18 billion of term debt and cad 100 million of term debt during 2006 under its registration statements we used the proceeds from these issuances to fund receivable growth and repay shortterm debt 

contractual obligations 

manufacturing group 

the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations of our manufacturing group to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of december 30 2006 as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 

   

a longterm debt and capital lease obligations exclude interest payments operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 

b we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years we also expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately 45 million to 60 million per year over the next five years which are not reflected in this table 

c other longterm liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2006 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience many of our other longterm liabilities have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments these excluded liabilities primarily include deferred income taxes 

d purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of december 30 2006 the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

in january 2005 we contracted with a thirdparty service provider for the oversight of our information technology infrastructure including maintenance operational oversight and purchases of hardware the “it contract” the it contract covers a 10year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications we have retained the right to approve significant design equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider we can terminate the it contract for convenience prior to 

its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed 59 million at december 30 2006 

finance group 

the following table summarizes our finance group’s known contractual obligations to make future payments due to the nature of finance companies we also have contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future we generally borrow funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of our finance receivables the contractual payments and receipts as of december 30 2006 are detailed below 

   

finance receivable receipts related to finance leases and term loans are based on contractual cash flows finance receivable receipts related to revolving loans are based on historical cash flow experience these amounts could differ due to prepayments chargeoffs and other factors receipts and contractual payments exclude finance charges from receivables debt interest payments proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 

as shown in the preceding table our cash and receipts are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities at december 30 2006 our finance group had 29 billion in debt and 426 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

at december 30 2006 our finance group had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under 13 billion of committed revolving lines of credit compared with 12 billion at december 31 2005 these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused we are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded 

offbalance sheet arrangements and guarantees 

we extend a variety of financial and performance guarantees to third parties as provided in the table below 

   

 these agreements include uncapped guarantees as described below 

performance guarantee 

in 2004 through our bell helicopter business we formed agustawestlandbell llc “awb llc” with agustawestland north america inc “awna” this venture was created for the joint design development manufacture sale customer training and product support of the vh71 helicopter and certain variations and derivatives thereof to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government in march 2005 awb llc received a 12 billion cost reimbursementtype subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49 of awb llc’s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract agustawestland nv awna’s parent company has guaranteed the remaining 51 to lockheed martin we have entered into crossindemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s workshare under any subcontracts received 

for 2006 awb llc’s maximum obligation was 40 of the total contract value which equates to 464 million based on the current contract value of 12 billion in 2007 and thereafter awb llc’s maximum obligation increases to 50 or 580 million accordingly the maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee was 227 million at december 30 2006 and will be 284 million thereafter through completion 

guaranteed minimum resale contracts 

we have a number of guaranteed minimum resale value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales if the fair value of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount we may be required to make a future payment to the customer or provide a minimum tradein value toward a new aircraft these agreements generally include operating restrictions such as maximum usage over the contract period or minimum maintenance requirements we also have guaranteed the minimum resale value of certain customerowned aircraft anticipated to be traded in upon completion of a model currently under development these contracts expire as follows 2 million in 2008 3 million in 2009 3 million in 2010 3 million in 2011 and 19 million in 2012 

guarantees related to dispositions 

we have guaranteed payment on certain credit facilities and bankissued letters of credit and guarantees of the fastening systems business where the total guarantee is capped at approximately 9 million for which the buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately 4 million as collateral we also have guaranteed payment and performance on certain other credit facilities and leases of the fastening systems business totaling approximately 14 million where we also are liable for unpaid interest fees and other costs associated with claims that may arise from these guarantees while potential interest and fees are not capped we have monitoring provisions that mitigate the exposure to these additional costs the buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately 9 million as collateral on these guarantees 

we also have indemnified the purchaser of the fastening systems business for remediation costs related to preexisting environmental conditions to the extent they exist at the sold locations we have estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at approximately 12 million potential payments under these obligations are not capped and as a result the maximum potential obligation cannot be determined 

in connection with the disposition of trim to subsidiaries of ca certain equipment and operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of ca we guaranteed ca’s payments under these leases and for an environmental matter 

we also have obligations arising from sales of certain other businesses including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental health and safety and tax and employment matters the maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps 

losssharing agreements 

in connection with the sale of a note receivable in 2005 our finance group has indemnified the purchaser against potential losses in limited circumstances the maximum potential exposure of the indemnity is estimated to be 29 million but due to the extremely low probability of occurrence and several other mitigating factors including a specific indemnification from the original note issuer no significant fair value has been attributed to the indemnity 

in connection with the sale of the small business direct financing business in 2003 our finance group entered into a losssharing agreement this agreement required us to reimburse the purchaser for 50 of losses incurred on the portfolio above a 4 annual level a liability of 14 million was originally recorded representing the estimated fair value of the guarantee during the fourth quarter of 2006 we entered into a settlement agreement with the purchaser which terminated our obligation to reimburse the purchaser for future losses the settlement resulted in a 1 million loss net of tax from discontinued operations in 2006 

at december 31 2005 our finance group had a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease streams with a maximum liability of 42 million these lease streams were sold in 2006 and we had no remaining liability at the end of 2006 

software indemnifications 

with the acquisition of overwatch systems in 2006 we now are a party to software license agreements with customers these software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights to date we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements 

forward contract 

we enter into a forward contract in our common stock on an annual basis the contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stockbased incentive compensation indexed to our stock the forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing common stock price as of december 30 2006 the contract was for approximately 15 million shares with a strike price of 7762 the market price of the stock was 9377 at december 30 2006 resulting in a receivable of 24 million compared with a receivable of 10 million at december 31 2005 

finance receivable securitizations and sales 

we sell finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and wholeloan sales as a result of these transactions finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we utilize these offbalance sheet financing arrangements primarily assetbacked securitizations to further diversify funding alternatives these arrangements provided net proceeds from operations of 50 million and 361 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these shortduration receivables we have used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper 

wholeloan finance receivable sales in which we maintain a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred limited credit enhancement occasionally is provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and to a lesser extent prepayment risk at december 30 2006 we had no remaining contingent liabilities related to credit losses or prepayment risk associated with wholeloan sales termination of our offbalance sheet financing arrangements would reduce our shortterm funding alternatives while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require us to repurchase significant amounts of receivables previously sold there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality downgrades in our finance group’s debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements we do not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on our liquidity or income from operations 

critical accounting policies 

to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

allowance for losses on finance receivables 

our allowance for losses on finance receivables is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values among other factors therefore changes in economic conditions or credit metrics including past due and nonperforming accounts or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may require additions or reductions to our reserves 

we evaluate the collectibility of our finance receivables based on a combination of factors for homogeneous loan pools we examine current delinquencies characteristics of the existing accounts historical loss experience underlying collateral value and general economic conditions and trends we estimate losses will range from 03 to 60 of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool for larger balance commercial loans we also consider borrower specific information industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows our process involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment while we believe that our consideration of the factors and assumptions 

referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses the allowance for losses on finance receivables currently represents 11 of total finance receivables during the last five years net chargeoffs as a percentage of finance receivables have ranged from 038 to 208 

longterm contracts 

we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to longterm contracts these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixedprice purchase options for additional products we accounted for these longterm contracts under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term based on either input eg costs incurred under the costtocost method which typically is used for development effort or output eg units delivered under the unitsofdelivery method which is used for production effort as appropriate under the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements complexity of design and related development costs performance of subcontractors availability and cost of materials labor productivity and cost overhead and capital costs manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries 

our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different revenues andor cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2006 using the estimates from our longterm strategic plans no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 

goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions if different assumptions were used in these forecasts the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

the impact of reducing our fair value estimates by 10 would have no impact on our goodwill assessment with the exception of two reporting units as described below assuming a 10 reduction in our fair value estimates the carrying value of these reporting units would approximate or exceed fair value 

our operating plans and projections anticipate investments in capital expenditures at our fluid handling products reporting unit to resolve current capacity issues as well as to capture additional business in the oil and gas markets over the next two years the related volume increases are anticipated to result in approximately 25 annual operating profit growth over this period in the remaining fiveyear planning period we anticipate an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately 7 driven by anticipated revenue growth of 4 annually with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts should the revenue growth rates over the next two years approximate 

historical levels the estimated fair value would be reduced by up to approximately 50 million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at december 30 2006 the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately 206 million 

our operating plans and projections for the golf and turf care reporting unit anticipate operating margin improvements over the fiveyear planning period resulting in high singledigit margins with anticipated annual revenue growth of approximately 4 a 100basispoint decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately 60 million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at december 30 2006 the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately 141 million 

retirement benefits 

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections we evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and investment advisors we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increases 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2006 the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 854 compared with 857 in 2005 in 2006 and 2005 the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans which represent approximately 82 of our total pension obligations was 875 a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return would result in a 20 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2006 we lowered the weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense to 555 from 569 in 2005 for our qualified domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 565 for 2006 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate would result in a 29 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2006 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the 2006 medical rate of 8 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2009 and then remain at that level the 2006 prescription drug rate of 12 is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2013 and then remain at that level see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

recently announced accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” this interpretation provides a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns we will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position fas 132 “accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction” this staff position amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and requires a recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by the leveraged lease in accordance with this guidance the difference between the revised calculation of earnings since lease inception and the actual amount of cumulative earnings recognized is recorded in income from continuing operations we are required to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2007 upon adoption the estimated change in the projected cash flows must be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings the adoption of this staff position resulted in a 33 million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2007 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this statement replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements this statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning subsequent to november 15 2007 we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2008 and currently are evaluating its impact on our financial position and results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt and vice versa the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate debt we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixedrate debt and adjust the mix as necessary based on our evaluation of internal and external factors the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2006 2005 or 2004 

our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at december 30 2006 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 431 million net of 29 billion of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixedrate debt to a floatingrate equivalent and 46 million of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixedrate finance receivables to a floatingrate equivalent interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our finance group by 27 million in 2006 and decreasing interest expense by 11 million and 40 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

foreign exchange risks 

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured andor sold for 2006 the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2005 increased revenues by approximately 11 million 01 and increased segment profit by approximately 2 million 02 

for our manufacturing operations we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 

in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately 765 million at the end of 2006 and 699 million at the end of 2005 

quantitative risk measures 

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts 

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a 10 decrease in the quoted market price of the marketable equity security 

   

 the value represents an asset or liability

textron financial corporation’s largest business risk is the collectibility of its finance receivable portfolio see “finance portfolio quality” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 23 for a detailed discussion of the credit quality of this portfolio 

  

discontinued operations – fastening systems 

  

in december 2005 we committed to a plan to sell our fastening systems business textron fastening systems “tfs” in its entirety this plan was approved by our board of directors on december 7 2005 and the results of operations for tfs are now reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information

backlog 

  

us government backlog was 33 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 including backlog at bell helicopter of 22 billion in 2005 and 25 billion in 2004 approximately 98 of the 2005 backlog was funded at december 31 2005 unfunded backlog represents the award value of us government contracts received generally related to costplus type contracts in excess of the funding formally appropriated by the us government the us government is obligated only up to the funded amount of the contract additional funding is appropriated as the contract progresses 

  

commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was 74 billion and 63 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively including backlog at cessna of 63 billion in 2005 and 53 billion in 2004 a significant portion of cessna’s backlog represents orders from a major fractional jet customer orders from this fractional aircraft operator are included in backlog when the customer enters into a definitive master agreement and has established preliminary delivery dates for the aircraft preliminary delivery dates are subject to change through amendment to the master agreement final delivery dates are established approximately 12 to 18 months prior to delivery orders from other customers are included in backlog upon the customer entering into a definitive purchase order and receipt of required deposits

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks including those discussed below which may affect the value of our securities the risks discussed below are those that we believe are currently the most significant although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also impact our business financial condition and results of operations perhaps materially 

  

we may be unable to effectively mitigate pricing pressures 

  

in some markets particularly where we deliver component products and services to original equipment manufacturers we face ongoing customer demands for price reductions which are sometimes contractually obligated in some cases we are able to offset these reductions through technological advances or by lowering our cost base through improved operating and supply chain efficiencies however if we are unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures our financial results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

delays in aircraft delivery schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect our financial results 

  

aircraft customers including sellers of fractional share interests may respond to weak economic conditions by delaying delivery of orders or canceling orders weakness in the economy may also result in fewer hours flown on existing aircraft and consequently lower demand for spare parts and maintenance weak economic conditions may also cause reduced demand for used business jets we may accept used aircraft on tradein that would be subject to fluctuations in the fair market value of the aircraft while in inventory reduced demand for new and used business jets spare parts and maintenance can have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 

  

delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft products and other products could affect our financial results of operations these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles production changes to meet customer demands coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed we also could be adversely affected if the general efficacy of our research and development investments to develop products is less than expected 

  

we have customer concentration with the us government 

  

during 2005 we derived approximately 18 of our revenue from sales to a variety of us government entities our ability to compete successfully for and retain this business is highly dependent on technical excellence management proficiency strategic alliances costeffective performance and the ability to recruit and retain key personnel us government programs are subject to uncertain future funding levels which can 

  

  

result in the extension or termination of programs our business is also highly sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and us government budgets 

  

us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 

  

the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 

  

if any of our contracts are terminated by the us government our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contracts and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor 

  

in addition to unfavorable termination provisions our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations reduce the value of existing contracts issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products services and associated materials 

  

cost overruns on us government contracts could subject us to losses or adversely affect our future business 

  

contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance estimates of award fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 

  

because of the significance of the estimates described above it is likely that different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial results of operations 

  

under fixedprice contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and consequently any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us under time and materials contracts we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses under cost reimbursement contracts which are subject to a contractceiling amount we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee which may be fixed or performance based however if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 

  

we may make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business 

  

we may enter into acquisitions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and costeffective manner challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses and the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations 

  

our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control 

  

our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and cancelled orders in addition we purchase components and raw materials from numerous suppliers and even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events we could be affected by interruptions of production at such suppliers such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations 

  

  

our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues 

  

approximately 18500 of our employees are unionized which represented approximately 40 of our employees at december 31 2005 including employees of the discontinued business of textron fastening systems as a result we may experience work stoppages which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers and a loss of revenues in addition the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

in addition to our workforce the workforces of many of our customers and suppliers are represented by labor unions work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key customers could result in delayed or cancelled orders for our products work stoppages and strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes any of these results could adversely affect our financial results of operations 

  

our textron finance borrowing group’s business is dependent on its continuing access to the capital markets 

  

our financings are conducted through two borrowing groups textron finance and textron manufacturing textron finance consists of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries which are the entities through which we operate in the finance segment textron finance relies on its access to the capital markets to fund asset growth fund operations and meet debt obligations and other commitments textron finance raises funds through commercial paper borrowings issuances of mediumterm notes and other term debt securities and syndication and securitization of receivables additional liquidity is provided to textron finance through bank lines of credit much of the capital markets funding is made possible by the maintenance of credit ratings that are acceptable to investors if the credit ratings of textron finance were to be lowered it might face higher borrowing costs a disruption of its access to the capital markets or both textron finance could also lose access to financing for other reasons such as a general disruption of the capital markets any disruption of textron finance’s access to the capital markets could adversely affect its business and our profitability 

  

if textron finance is unable to maintain portfolio credit quality our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

a key determinant of financial performance at textron finance will be its ability to maintain the quality of loans leases and other credit products in its finance asset portfolios portfolio quality may adversely be affected by several factors including finance receivable underwriting procedures collateral quality geographic or industry concentrations or general economic downturns any inability by textron finance to successfully collect its finance receivable portfolio and to resolve problem accounts may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business including proceedings and claims relating to private sector transactions government contracts production partners product liability employment and environmental contamination under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our being suspended or debarred from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in any particular period 

  

the levels of our reserves are subject to many uncertainties and may not be adequate to cover writedowns or losses 

  

in addition to reserves at textron finance we establish reserves in our manufacturing segments to cover uncollectible accounts receivable excess or obsolete inventory fair market value writedowns on used aircraft and golf cars recall campaigns warranty costs and litigation these reserves are subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience and are subject to many uncertainties including bankruptcy or other financial problems at key customers 

  

in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable it is reasonably possible such matters could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable 

  

the effect on our financial results of many of these factors depends in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering potential losses at reasonable rates 

  

  

currency raw material price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

  

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase derivatives or enter into contracts to insulate our financial results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates raw material prices and interest rates can have substantial adverse effects on our financial results of operations 

  

the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results 

  

our earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend or record for employee benefit plans this is particularly true for our pension plans which are dependent on actual plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of plan benefit obligations 

  

in addition medical costs are rising at a rate faster than the general inflation rate continued medical cost inflation in excess of the general inflation rate increases the risk that we will not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits increases to the costs of pension and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in textron’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or in tax laws which could affect our profitability in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability

 item 2 properties 

  

in december 2005 our board of directors authorized the divestiture of the textron fastening systems business as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2005 the fastening systems business included 19 plants located throughout the united states and 20 plants outside of the united states of the total of 39 plants operated in the fastening systems business we owned 28 with the balance leased and had total manufacturing space of approximately 107 million square feet 

  

on december 31 2005 excluding textron fastening systems’ plants we operated a total of 77 plants located throughout the united states and 58 plants outside the united states of the total of 135 plants we owned 65 and the balance was leased in the aggregate the total manufacturing space was approximately 214 million square feet 

  

we also own or lease offices warehouse and other space at various locations we consider the productive capacity of the plants operated by each of our business segments to be adequate in general our facilities are in good condition are considered to be adequate for the uses to which they are being put and are substantially in regular use 

  

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

two identical lawsuits purporting to be class actions were filed in 2002 in the united states district court in rhode island against textron and certain present and former officers of textron and bell helicopter by textron shareholders suing on their own behalf and on behalf of a purported class of textron shareholders a consolidated amended complaint alleged that the defendants failed to make certain accounting adjustments in response to alleged problems with bell helicopter’s v22 and h1 programs and that the company failed to timely write down certain assets of its omniquip unit the complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages on june 15 2004 the district court ruled that the plaintiffs could not maintain the claims that were based on allegations relating to the h1 program or to omniquip and also ruled that all claims against one of the individual defendants should be dismissed the district court certified the class of shareholders on may 11 2005 all claims in the litigation were subsequently settled for a cash amount to be paid by textron’s insurer the settlement was preliminarily approved by the district court on january 31 2006 

  

separately two identical lawsuits purporting to be class actions on behalf of textron benefit plans and participants and beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and 2001 were filed in 2002 in the united states district court in rhode island against textron the textron savings plan and the plan’s trustee a consolidated amended complaint alleges breach of certain fiduciary duties under erisa based on the amount of plan assets invested in textron stock during 2000 and 2001 the complaint seeks equitable relief and compensatory damages on behalf of various textron benefit plans and the participants and beneficiaries of those plans during 2000 and 2001 to compensate for alleged losses relating to textron stock held as an asset of those plans textron’s motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint was granted on june 24 2003 on may 7 2004 the united states court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed dismissal of all claims against the plan’s trustee and against the plan itself and also affirmed dismissal of certain other claims against textron however the court of appeals ruled that plaintiffs should be permitted to attempt to develop their breach of fiduciary duty claims and remanded those claims to the district court textron believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend this action vigorously 

  

we are subject to actual and threatened legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business these proceedings include claims arising from private transactions government contracts product liability employment and environmental safety and health matters some of these legal proceedings seek damages fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination under federal government procurement regulations certain claims brought by the us government could result in our suspension or debarment from us government contracting for a period of time on the basis of information presently available we believe that these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

business overview 

  

textron inc is a multiindustry company that leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services in four business segments bell cessna industrial and finance textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the business jet aerospace and defense plastic fuel systems golf car and turfcare markets among others 

  

the global economy continued to grow in most of our major markets in 2005 despite early weakness in some regions including parts of europe the us economy in particular proved resilient in the face of hurricanes katrina and rita overall capital spending continued to grow at a steady and sustainable rate our company’s performance is strongly related to this key economic factor which reflects investments in longer lasting items such as equipment facilities and vehicles 

  

we had strong sales in 2005 – particularly in our aerospace and defense businesses we were able to deliver exceptional organic growth gains from existing business excluding the effects of acquisitions and other changes of 19 which is the result of our commitment to bringing new products and services to our customers orders were strong most notably at bell where a steady flow of military orders resulted from continued spending in the defense sector and we received robust orders in our commercial helicopter business cessna also saw a significant increase in new business jet orders as a result of strength in the aircraft sector and the popularity of its new model introductions and our finance segment experienced significant improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer chargeoffs and a decrease in nonperforming assets however industrial volumes were down slightly from 2004 largely due to a downturn in the north american automotive industry 

  

while we were impacted by inflation and higher pension costs in 2005 we were able to absorb the impact of these factors primarily as a result of the increased volumes and the benefit of our transformation strategy to reduce costs introduce new products and enhance our portfolio of businesses we will continue to execute our transformation strategy and position textron to take advantage of the improved economic conditions 

  

to strengthen our overall position in our markets we have continued to improve upon our portfolio of businesses during 2005 we sold our interest in the model ab139 helicopter program to agusta our partner in the baac venture we also purchased us helicopter to increase bell’s ability to provide aftersales service bought out kautex’s japanese joint venture partner to take advantage of a rapidly growing market and set up a new joint venture with a german company rothenberger ag to expand our presence in north american plumbing tools in december 2005 our board of directors authorized management’s plan for the divestiture of our textron fastening systems business with this approval we have committed to actively market this business and anticipate no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale within the next twelve months as a result this business was reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2005

outlook 

  

we expect higher revenues in 2006 as a result of revenue increases at bell cessna and finance while the industrial businesses are expected to be down slightly at bell revenues are expected to increase primarily due to higher commercial helicopter deliveries at cessna we expect an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current delivery schedule 

  

textron’s commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was 74 billion and 63 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively and is primarily related to cessna us government backlog was 33 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 which was substantially all in the bell segment see “backlog” in item 1 business of textron on page 6 for more information 

  

segment analysis 

  

bell 

  

   

  

the bell segment is a supplier of aircraft and weapon systems providing advanced product and service solutions to both military and commercial customers bell helicopter is a leading manufacturer of military helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft for the us government and commercial helicopters for corporate offshore petroleum exploration and development utility charter police fire rescue and emergency medical customers textron systems is a primary supplier to the defense aerospace and general aviation markets 

  

bell helicopter participates in several major programs with the us government in association with the boeing company bell helicopter is the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft – the v22 the us government has issued contracts for 83 production v22 aircraft with a total requirement of 458 aircraft in september 2005 bell received authorization to proceed to fullrate production of the v22 

  

bell helicopter is nearing completion of the engineering and manufacturing development “emd” phase of the h1 upgrade program for the us marine corps this program will produce an advanced attack and a utility model helicopter the ah1z and uh1y respectively the operational evaluation for this program is planned to begin shortly after the delivery of the remaining two aircraft in 2006 the us government has also issued contracts for the production of ten uh1y aircraft and six ah1z aircraft through low rate initial production a contract for an additional lot along with a priced option for another lot is planned to be exercised in the second quarter of 2006 

  

additionally bell was awarded a contract for system development and demonstration of the army’s armed reconnaissance helicopter “arh” with an expected requirement of 368 aircraft bell will also participate in the production of the vh71 presidential helicopter fleet through awb llc 

  

during 2005 bell helicopter’s commercial business gained momentum with an increase in orders and deliveries bell continued to invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on the 429 global ranger and other program upgrades in response to customer requests to improve speed lower operating costs and reduce noise 

  

textron systems’ principal strategy and focus is to address the emphasis being placed by the us department of defense on network centric warfare and the leveraging of advances in information technology by focusing on the development and production of advanced weapon systems additionally textron systems has received orders to deliver more than 1100 armored security vehicles “asv” currently production capacity is ramping up to meet these deliveries in spite of the disruptions caused by hurricane katrina 

  

bell revenues 

  

us government business 

  

us government revenues increased 491 million in 2005 primarily due to higher revenue of 288 million from the v22 program higher asv volume of 61 million the benefit of 36 million from the us helicopter acquisition higher military spares volume of 32 million and increased sales of 20 million for airlaunched weapons additionally bell recognized 21 million from the new arh contract 

  

us government revenues decreased 166 million in 2004 largely due to lower revenue of 243 million on the v22 program primarily as a result of lower effort on production lots three through six as these contracts neared completion and a decrease in development activities lower sales of 30 million related to the completion of a contract for training aircraft in 2003 and an 11 million reduction in revenue related to a final agreement with the us government to settle an overhead cost rate matter also contributed to the revenue decrease these decreases in revenue were partially offset by 34 million of higher military spares volume increased sales of 34 million for airlaunched weapons and higher h1 revenue of 34 million 

  

commercial business 

  

commercial revenues increased 136 million in 2005 primarily due to higher aircraft sales of 68 million higher spares volume of 41 million and higher international military sales of 26 million due primarily to higher asv deliveries to foreign customers of 58 million that were partially offset by lower helicopter volume of 32 million 

  

commercial revenues increased 72 million in 2004 primarily due to higher international military sales of 64 million increased volume in the aircraft engine business of 18 million and higher spares volume of 14 million these increases were partially offset by lower huey ii kit sales of 16 million and lower aircraft sales of 6 million 

  

  

bell segment profit 

  

us government business 

  

profit in the us government business increased 33 million in 2005 principally due to higher v22 volume of 26 million reflecting the delivery of 12 aircraft from lots 7 and 8 higher volume and improved performance of airlaunched weapons totaling 13 million and increased asv deliveries and improved performance of 10 million these increases were partially offset by 18 million of costs associated with hurricane katrina 

  

profit in the us government business decreased 31 million in 2004 primarily due to the 20 million impact of lower v22 revenue an 11 million settlement with the us government and lower volume of training aircraft of 11 million partially offset by the 10 million impact of higher volume of airlaunched weapons 

  

commercial business 

  

commercial profit increased 85 million in 2005 primarily due to the 30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab139 helicopter program the 29 million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance higher spares volume of 22 million and a 13 million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement in addition commercial profit reflected a 16 million decrease in net research and development as higher gross research and development expenses of 28 million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risksharing agreements from codevelopment partners these increases were partially offset by 28 million of higher selling and administrative expense and 18 million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming related to the retirement program discussed below and crankshaft service bulletins discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2005 lycoming developed a plan to institute a retirement program for approximately 5100 crankshafts representing the remaining crankshafts manufactured by the former supplier using the same forging technique as the crankshafts covered by prior service bulletins accordingly an additional reserve of 10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the expected cost of this planned retirement program 

  

commercial profit increased 47 million in 2004 primarily due to the 34 million impact of the higher international military sales favorable cost performance in the helicopter business of 31 million including the favorable resolution of a 6 million warranty issue provided for in 2003 the 9 million benefit from a favorable mix of aircraft and the 5 million favorable impact of a nonrecurring 2003 charge related to a recall inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business partially offset by higher engineering expenses of 28 million 

  

bell outlook 

  

bell’s revenues are expected to increase in 2006 while margins are expected to drop slightly due to the certain nonrecurring items that benefited the 2005 results the us government business is expected to benefit from an increase in asv volume as well as higher revenues from the arh and vh71 program contracts which is expected to be partially offset by lower v22 revenue based on scheduled deliveries higher revenue is expected in our commercial business largely due to increased deliveries in 2005 

  

cessna 

  

   

cessna aircraft company is the world’s largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft based on unit sales cessna currently has four major product lines citation business jets single engine turboprop caravans cessna single engine piston aircraft and aftermarket services cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate customers in over 75 countries cessna also engages in the business jet fractional ownership market through citationshares a venture with tag aviation usa inc during 2005 the economy continued to strengthen leading to a significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders at the same time cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of investment in new product development receiving faa certification for the cj1 and the cj2 in 2005 cessna also expects to receive certification of the mustang in 2006 

  

  

cessna revenues 

  

the cessna segment’s revenues increased 10 billion in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to higher citation business jet volume of 737 million higher pricing of 82 million and a benefit from the consolidation of citationshares of 78 million citation business jet customer deliveries were 252 in 2005 compared with 179 jets in 2004 

  

the cessna segment’s revenues increased 174 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to the 76 million increase from the consolidation of citationshares 39 million of higher pricing and a 12 million benefit from lower to used aircraft overtrade allowances citation business revenue jet deliveries were 179 in 2004 compared with 194 jets in 2003 

  

cessna segment profit 

  

segment profit increased 190 million in 2005 compared with 2004 largely due to the 229 million impact of higher volume across all product lines and 82 million of higher pricing partially offset by 99 million of inflation additionally cessna was able to significantly improve profit margins and overcome the challenges associated with ramping up production and increasing research and development expenses 

  

segment profit increased 68 million in 2004 compared with 2003 largely due to 85 million of improved cost performance 39 million of higher pricing 18 million of lower used aircraft valuation adjustments a 12 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and an 8 million benefit related to the expiration of prior year residual value guarantees partially offset by 70 million of inflation and the unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of 20 million the benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer tradeins and a stabilization in market values for used jets in 2004 

  

cessna outlook 

  

cessna anticipates another strong year of business jet deliveries in 2006 with total revenues expected to increase significantly indications are that 2007 will be a strong delivery year as well in 2006 profit margins are expected to rise primarily driven by the increase in revenue cessna will continue to invest in new products such as the encore and the mustang broadening our product line to take advantage of the improving business jet market 

  

industrial 

  

   

the industrial segment is composed of five businesses including ezgo jacobsen kautex greenlee and fluid  power through these businesses the segment provides its customers with innovative solutions and services including golf cars and turfcare equipment plastic fuel systems wire and cable installation equipment and industrial pumps and gears these markets are highly competitive and price sensitive consequently significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions primarily at kautex but also to improve margins 

  

industrial revenues 

  

the industrial segment’s revenues increased 8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 as higher pricing of 36 million and favorable foreign exchange of 31 million were largely offset by lower volume of 63 million the lower sales volume primarily reflects decreases of 80 million at kautex largely due to product model changeovers and 39 million at jacobsen primarily related to the strategic realignment of its north american commercial distribution network these decreases were partially offset by higher volume of 31 million at greenlee 

  

the industrial segment’s revenues increased 210 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of 167 million and higher sales volume of 61 million partially offset by 17 million related to the divestiture of a noncore product line during the second quarter of 2004 the higher sales volume primarily reflects an increase of 44 million at kautex largely due to new product launches and growth in its international markets and to a lesser degree increases of 18 million and 12 million at ezgo and jacobsen respectively 

  

  

industrial segment profit 

  

segment profit decreased 44 million in 2005 compared with 2004 largely due to inflation of 84 million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of 21 million partially offset by higher pricing of 36 million and improved cost performance of 24 million primarily at kautex 

  

segment profit increased 44 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to 92 million of improved cost performance improved credit performance of 16 million the favorable foreign exchange impact of 13 million the 10 million impact of higher volume and lower fair market value adjustments of 8 million for used golf cars these increases were partially offset by inflation of 59 million and lower profit of 24 million at a north american kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing inefficiencies 

  

industrial outlook 

  

industrial revenues are expected to decrease in 2006 while segment margins are forecasted to improve slightly the forecasted decrease in revenues reflects a decline at kautex primarily as a result of model changeovers and the divestiture of a product line in 2005 which is expected to be partially offset by growth at greenlee and to a lesser extent increases for the remaining businesses 

  

finance 

  

   

the finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business with core operations in aircraft finance assetbased lending distribution finance golf finance resort finance and structured capital its financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial markets within these core operations this segment also provides financing programs for products manufactured by textron in 2005 management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating noncore assets 

  

finance revenues 

  

the finance segment’s revenues increased 83 million in 2005 compared with 2004 the increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of 95 million partially offset by lower prepayment income of 10 million the increase in finance charges and discounts was largely due to a higher interest rate environment which accounted for 98 million of the increase and 62 million related to higher average finance receivables of 855 million partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of 65 million the increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution golf and aircraft finance and assetbased lending partially offset by reductions in the liquidating noncore portfolios 

  

the finance segment’s revenues decreased 27 million in 2004 compared with 2003 the decrease was primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of 35 million largely due to the continued liquidation of noncore assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of 269 million and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance business the decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of 13 million primarily due to improved yield and 20 million from an increase in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving conduit partially offset by a 6 million reduction in resort finance gains 

  

finance segment profit 

  

segment profit increased 32 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to a 29 million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality and an 18 million increase in net interest margin which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of 15 million the increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to 9 million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and 5 million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost 

  

segment profit increased 17 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to a 23 million decrease in the provision for loan losses reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality partially offset by lower net interest margin of 10 million 

  

  

finance portfolio quality 

  

the following table presents information about the credit quality of the finance segment’s portfolio 

  

   

the finance segment has experienced significant improvements in portfolio quality over the past two years the improvements in credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and 60 days contractual delinquency 

  

textron finance’s nonperforming assets include nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by textron manufacturing for which interest has been suspended and repossessed assets nonperforming assets for each of the last three yearends by business are as follows 

  

   

we believe that nonperforming assets will generally be in the range of 1 to 4 of finance assets depending on economic conditions textron finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming assets with a 29 million decrease in 2005 and a 22 million decrease in 2004 the decrease in 2005 was primarily attributable to core businesses including 22 million in resort finance and 13 million in golf finance largely related to improved general economic conditions these decreases were partially offset by an increase in liquidating portfolios these noncore businesses continue to compose a disproportionate amount of textron finance’s nonperforming assets accounting for 41 of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than 5 of the total finance assets at december 31 2005 

  

finance outlook 

  

in 2006 we expect the finance segment’s profit to increase primarily as a result of improved net interest margin related to higher average finance receivables 

  

  

special charges by segment 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

textron’s financings are conducted through two borrowing groups textron manufacturing and textron finance this framework is designed to enhance textron’s borrowing power by separating the finance segment to support creditors in evaluating the separate borrowing groups textron presents separate balance sheets and statements of cash flows for each borrowing group textron manufacturing consists of textron inc the parent company consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell cessna and industrial business segments whose financial results are a reflection of the ability to manage and finance the development production and delivery of tangible goods and services textron finance consists of textron’s wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary textron financial corporation consolidated with its subsidiaries the financial results of textron finance are a reflection of its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace at appropriate pricing while managing the associated financial risks the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities result in different measures used by investors rating agencies and analysts 

  

a portion of textron finance’s business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by textron manufacturing the cash flows related to these captive financing activities are reflected as operating activities by textron manufacturing and as investing activities by textron finance based on each group’s operations these captive financing transactions have been eliminated and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows when received 

  

textron inc provides a support agreement to textron finance that requires textron inc to maintain 100 ownership of textron finance the agreement also requires textron finance to maintain fixed charge coverage of no less than 125 and consolidated shareholder’s equity of no less than 200 million textron finance’s bank agreements prohibit the termination of the support agreement 

  

textron’s financial position continued to be strong at the end of 2005 and included aggregate cash and cash equivalents of 796 million compared with 697 million at the end of 2004 during 2005 cash flows from operations were the primary source of funds for our operating needs dividends and capital expenditures management analyzes operating cash flows for textron manufacturing by tracking free cash flow which is calculated using net cash provided by operating activities adding back proceeds on the sale of property plant and equipment then subtracting capital expenditures including those financed with capital leases 

  

  

operating cash flows of continuing operations 

  

   

operating cash flows on a consolidated basis have remained fairly consistent over the past few years these consolidated cash flows exclude net captive financing activity cash outflows from finance receivable originations net of cash inflows from repayments sales and securitizations between textron manufacturing and textron finance in 2005 and 2004 this net captive financing activity increased textron manufacturing’s separate cash flows by 100 million and 165 million respectively while in 2003 cash flows were decreased by 86 million excluding these net changes from textron manufacturing’s cash flows the increase in 2005 is largely due to increased income from operations while the increase in 2004 is largely due to increased customer deposits in the bell and cessna segments resulting from an increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters 

  

textron manufacturing’s operating cash flows include aftertax cash used to fund textron’s restructuring program of 12 million in 2005 24 million in 2004 and 34 million in 2003 this program was substantially completed at the end of 2005 with forecasted cash payments in 2006 of approximately 4 million 

  

investing cash flows of continuing operations 

  

   

over the past three years textron’s consolidated cash flows used in investing activities have been largely driven by an increase in net financing activities at textron finance the 2005 and 2004 increases in cash used in investing activities in the consolidated cash flows reflect a higher use of cash resulting from the increase in finance receivable originations net of cash collections from repayments sales and securitizations of 198 million and 744 million respectively 

  

textron manufacturing increased its use of cash for investing activities by 204 million in 2005 primarily with a 118 million increase in capital expenditures and a 38 million decrease in proceeds that were received in 2004 from the sale of ca common stock the increase in capital expenditures is primarily related to higher spending at the bell segment in response to increased production demands capital expenditures for textron manufacturing totaled 371 million in 2005 282 million in 2004 and 272 million in 2003 including expenditures purchased through capital leases of 15 million in 2005 44 million in 2004 and 26 million in 2003 

  

the separate borrowing group cash flows of textron finance reflect investing activities that include 824 million 892 million and 886 million in noncash activity for finance receivables originated in connection with the sale of textron manufacturing’s inventory in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively cash received from customers and securitizations related to the sale of this inventory is also included within textron finance’s investing activities totaling 724 million 727 million and 972 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively within the consolidated statements of cash flows these amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a net amount in operating cash flows under the caption “captive finance receivables net”

the 2005 increase in cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows was largely due to an increase in debt outstanding at both textron manufacturing and textron finance the increase in textron manufacturing principally reflects a retirement of debt of 300 million in 2004 and the issuance of 281 million in short term debt in 2005 textron finance increased its debt outstanding to fund asset growth these 

  

  

increases were partially offset by higher cash outflows from a 182 million increase in purchases of textron common stock 81 million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans and a 54 million increase in dividend payments primarily due to the timing of dividend payments with four quarters paid in 2005 and only three quarters paid in 2004 

  

in 2004 the decrease in cash used by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows principally reflects a 715 million increase in cash provided by textron finance reflecting an increase in debt outstanding to fund asset growth partially offset by a decrease at textron manufacturing largely due to higher cash outflows from a 351 million increase in purchases of textron common stock 

  

principal payments and retirements of longterm debt 

  

in 2005 2004 and 2003 textron manufacturing made principal payments of 417 million 360 million and 503 million respectively in 2005 2004 and 2003 textron finance made principal payments on longterm debt of 08 billion 13 billion and 14 billion respectively 

  

stock repurchases 

  

on january 26 2006 textron’s board of directors authorized a new 12millionshare repurchase program this program supercedes textron’s previous authorization which was exhausted in january in 2005 2004 and 2003 textron repurchased approximately 8035000 6534000 and 1951000 shares of common stock respectively under its boardauthorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of 606 million 425 million and 66 million respectively 

  

dividends 

  

textron’s board of directors approved dividends of 140 per common share in 2005 on january 26 2006 the board of directors authorized a 015 per share increase in textron’s annualized common stock dividend to 155 per share and accordingly a quarterly dividend of 03875 per share for holders of record at the close of business on march 10 2006 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 189 million 135 million and 222 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the 2003 payments include an additional payment made for the fourth quarter dividend which is typically paid in the following year 

  

discontinued operations cash flows 

  

   

cash flows from discontinued operations include textron manufacturing’s fastening systems omniquip and intesys businesses and textron finance’s small business finance operation see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions in 2003 cash provided by investing activities included the receipt of 421 million in cash upon the sale of substantially all of the small business finance operation and 198 million in tax refunds and cash proceeds related to the sale of the omniquip business partially offset by 197 million in finance receivable originations net of repayments 

  

capital resources 

  

textron manufacturing’s debt net of cashtocapital ratio as of december 31 2005 was 26 compared with 25 at january 1 2005 textron manufacturing’s gross debttocapital ratio as of december 31 2005 was 37 compared with 33 at january 1 2005 textron manufacturing has established a gross debttocapital ratio target in the midthirties consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of textron finance in turn textron finance limits its borrowings to an amount taking into account the risk profile of its assets consistent with a single a credit rating surplus capital of textron finance is returned to textron inc 

  

borrowings have historically been a secondary source of funds for textron manufacturing and along with the collection of finance receivables are a primary source of funds for textron finance both textron manufacturing and textron finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and satisfy certain financial ratios since highquality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost we target a longterm a rating from the independent debtrating agencies in november 2005 fitch upgraded its outlook for textron manufacturing and textron finance to positive while moody’s and standard  poor’s have assessed the outlook for both groups as stable the credit ratings of these three debtratings agencies are as follows 

  

  

   

for liquidity purposes textron manufacturing and textron finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit to support their outstanding commercial paper none of these lines of credit was used at december 31 2005 or january 1 2005 textron manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of 13 billion that expire in 2010 textron manufacturing’s credit facilities permit textron finance to borrow under those facilities textron finance also has 15 billion in bank lines of credit of which 500 million expires in july 2006 and 10 billion expires in 2010 textron finance’s facility that expires in 2006 includes a oneyear term out option that effectively extends its expiration into 2007 at december 31 2005 the lines of credit not reserved as support for commercial paper and letters of credit were 12 billion for textron manufacturing and 300 million for textron finance 

  

under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission textron finance may issue public debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of 40 billion under this registration statement textron finance issued 14 billion of term debt and cad 01 billion of term debt during 2005 the proceeds from these issuances were used to fund receivable growth and repay shortterm debt at december 31 2005 textron finance had 18 billion available under this registration statement textron manufacturing may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of 20 billion under its shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission at december 31 2005 textron manufacturing had 16 billion available under this registration statement 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes textron manufacturing’s known contractual obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2005 as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

longterm debt and capital lease obligations included in the table above do not include interest payments operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 

  

textron maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments to be made by textron related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors including mortality assumptions expected retirement age rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates which are subject to change in future years textron also expects to make contributions to its funded pension plans in the range of 25 million to 30 million per year over the next five years which are not reflected in this table 

  

  

other longterm liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age mortality stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience 

  

purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of december 31 2005 textron’s ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

  

effective january 2 2005 textron engaged a thirdparty service provider to assume oversight of its information technology infrastructure including maintenance operational oversight and purchases of hardware the “it contract” the it contract covers a 10year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications textron retains the right to approve significant design equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider textron has the ability to terminate the it contract prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed 63 million in 2006 

  

in addition to the amounts included above textron manufacturing has contractual obligations related to certain businesses reported as discontinued operations primarily related to purchase obligations and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions these amounts are estimated to be paid as follows 54 million in less than one year 11 million in two years 1 million in three years 1 million in four years 1 million in five years and 27 million in more than five years 

  

the following table summarizes textron finance’s known contractual obligations to make future payments due to the nature of finance companies textron finance also has contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future textron finance generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables the contractual payments and receipts as of december 31 2005 are detailed below 

  

   

finance receivable receipts are based on contractual cash flows these amounts could differ due to prepayments chargeoffs and other factors contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and discounts from receivables debt interest payments proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 

  

as shown in the preceding table cash collections from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities at december 31 2005 textron finance had 22 billion in debt and 439 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months 

  

  

at december 31 2005 textron finance had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under 12 billion of committed revolving lines of credit compared with 10 billion at january 1 2005 since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

textron has joint venture agreements with external financing arrangements for which textron has guaranteed approximately 15 million in debt obligations including approximately 5 million related to discontinued operations textron would be required to make payments under these guarantees if a joint venture defaults under the debt agreements 

  

bell helicopter and agustawestland north america inc “awna” formed the agustawestlandbell llc “awb llc” in january 2004 for the joint design development manufacture sale customer training and product support of the us101 helicopter recently designated the vh71 helicopter and certain variations and derivatives thereof to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government 

  

in march 2005 awb llc received a 12 billion cost reimbursementtype subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps marine 1 helicopter squadron vh71 program on march 11 2005 bell helicopter guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract provided that bell helicopter’s liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49 of awb llc’s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract agustawestland nv awna’s parent company has guaranteed the remaining 51 to lockheed martin bell helicopter and agustawestland nv have entered into crossindemnification agreements in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party’s workshare under any subcontracts received 

  

for 2005 awb llc’s maximum obligation is 20 of the total contract value which equates to 232 million based on the current contract value of 12 billion in 2006 awb llc’s maximum obligation increases to 40 or 464 million and thereafter increases to 50 or 580 million accordingly the maximum amount of bell helicopter’s liability under the guarantee is 114 million at december 31 2005 and will be 227 million in 2006 and 284 million thereafter through completion 

  

textron manufacturing enters into a forward contract in textron common stock on an annual basis the contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stockbased incentive compensation indexed to textron stock the forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing textron common stock price as of december 31 2005 the contract was for approximately 17 million shares with a strike price of 7080 the market price of the stock was 7698 at december 31 2005 resulting in a receivable of 10 million compared with a receivable of 31 million at january 1 2005 

  

textron finance sells finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and wholeloan sales as a result of these transactions finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position textron finance generally retains a subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note 5 to the consolidated financial statements textron finance utilizes these offbalance sheet financing arrangements primarily assetbacked securitizations to further diversify funding alternatives these arrangements are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing operations of 361 million and 394 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively proceeds from securitizations includes proceeds received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and excludes amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these receivables with short durations textron finance has used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper 

  

wholeloan finance receivable sales in which textron finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and to a lesser extent prepayment risk textron finance has a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease rents in 2003 and 2001 the maximum liability at december 31 2005 was 42 million textron finance has valued this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and prepayment rates of 025 and 750 respectively an instantaneous 20 adverse change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of this recourse liability 

  

termination of textron finance’s offbalance sheet financing arrangements would significantly reduce its shortterm funding alternatives while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require textron finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously sold there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements 

  

  

include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality downgrades in textron finance’s debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements textron finance does not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of textron’s financial condition and results of operations are listed below we believe these policies require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 

  

receivable and inventory reserves 

  

we evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and finance receivables based on a combination of factors for larger balance commercial loans textron finance considers borrower specific information industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows as well as the factors reviewed for its homogeneous loan pools in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its shortterm financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings substantial downgrading of credit scores geographic economic conditions etc we record a specific reserve for bad debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible receivables are charged off when deemed uncollectible 

  

for homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies the characteristics of the existing accounts historical loss experience the value of underlying collateral and general economic conditions and trends textron finance estimates that its losses will range from 05 to 40 of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool finance receivables are written down to the fair value less estimated costs to sell of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months unless we deem the receivable collectible 

  

reserves on certain finance receivables are determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical recovery rates and current market conditions management reviews the market conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis a deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would result in lower estimated collateral values increasing the amount of reserves required on related receivables and used inventories on hand based on current market conditions and recovery rates we believe our reserves are adequate as of december 31 2005 

  

longterm contracts 

  

we recognize revenue and profit as work on certain government longterm engineering development and production contracts progresses using the contract method of accounting which relies on estimates of the total contract cost and revenue estimated contract cost and revenue are based on current contract specifications expected engineering requirements and the achievement of contract milestones including product deliveries contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgment the cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change adjustments to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition while unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified earnings on longterm contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to income if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

  

goodwill 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances such as declines in sales earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 using the estimates from our longterm strategic plans no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 

  

goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses’ strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management’s 

  

  

best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions if different assumptions were used in these plans the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

  

within our industrial segment the fluid handling products component has assumed an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately 9 over the fiveyear planning period driven by anticipated revenue growth of approximately 4 annually along with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts a 100basispoint reduction in the estimated operating profit growth rate from those used in our discounted cash flow model to approximately 8 would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately 20 million and may result in the carrying value of the business exceeding its estimated fair value potentially resulting in an impairment charge at december 31 2005 the goodwill allocated to this business totaled approximately 200 million 

  

securitized transactions 

  

securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts while the assets sold are no longer on our balance sheet our retained interests are included in other assets we may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of interestonly securities seller certificates cash reserve accounts and servicing rights and obligations our retained interests are subordinate to other investors’ interests in the securitizations generally we do not provide legal recourse to thirdparty investors that purchase interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest only securities seller certificates and cash reserve accounts 

  

we estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best estimates of prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved these assumptions are reviewed each quarter and the retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than temporary based on our sensitivity analysis as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements a 20 adverse change in either the prepayment speed expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount rate would not result in a material charge to income 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected longterm rates of return on plan assets discount rates and healthcare cost projections these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and the rate of compensation increases 

  

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense for 2005 we have reduced the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense to 857 from 872 in 2004 while over the past ten years returns for the largest pool of managed retirement assets have exceeded 997 the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of longterm rates of return in the financial markets as well as the change in our investment portfolio mix our qualified domestic plans compose over 83 of our total pension obligations in 2005 the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 875 a 50basispoint decrease in this longterm rate of return would result in a 21 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

  

the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled this rate should be in line with rates for highquality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits which fluctuate as longterm interest rates change a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense in 2005 we decreased our weightedaverage discount rate used in calculating pension expense to 569 from 617 in 2004 for our qualified domestic plans the assumed discount rate was 575 for 2005 a 50basispoint decrease in this discount rate would result in a 32 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 

  

the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for certain pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at december 31 2005 however strong asset returns and contributions to the plans reduced the shortfall during 2005 accordingly we recorded a noncash adjustment to shareholders’ equity for the minimum pension liability of 34 million net of income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities the 2005 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rate which is the weightedaverage annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits was 11 the medical rate is assumed to decrease to 5 by 2009 and then remain at that level the prescription drug rate is expected to rise to 12 

  

  

in 2006 then decrease to 5 by 2013 and then remain at that level see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a onepercentagepoint change in the cost trend rate 

  

income taxes 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognized future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss as appropriate 

  

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires companies to measure compensation costs for sharebased payments to employees including stock options at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission delayed the transition date for companies to the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 effectively delaying textron’s required adoption of sfas no 123r until the first quarter of 2006 

  

textron elected to adopt sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method under this transition method compensation expense recognized in 2005 includes a compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated and recognized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 and b compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted subsequent to january 1 2005 and all sharebased compensation awards accounted for as liabilities based upon the measurement and recognition provisions of sfas no 123r for awards granted or modified in 2005 and prospectively compensation costs for awards with only service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award compensation costs for awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized using the attribution methods required under sfas no 123 upon adoption textron remeasured its sharebased compensation awards that are accounted for as liabilities at fair value the cumulative effect of adoption upon this remeasurement resulted in an increase to net income of approximately 1 million in the first quarter of 2005 which is not considered to be material and is recorded in selling and administrative expense 

  

adoption of sfas no 123r resulted in recognition of stock option costs in 2005 the stock option costs are included primarily in selling and administrative expense and totaled approximately 15 million for continuing operations and 2 million for discontinued operations in 2005 in accordance with the modified prospective method prior periods have not been restated no compensation expense related to stock option grants has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2003 and 2004 as all of the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 

  

as of december 31 2005 58 million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested sharebased compensation awards subject only to service conditions that has not yet been recognized textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately two years as of december 31 2005 25 million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested sharebased compensation awards subject to performance vesting conditions that has not yet been recognized textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately two years 

  

  

sfas no 123r requires that the excess tax benefits received related to stock option exercises be presented as financing cash inflows for 2005 14 million of these excess tax benefits have been presented as cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

the valuation of stock options requires numerous assumptions textron determines the fair value of each option as of the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model this model requires inputs for the expected volatility of textron’s common stock price expected life of the option and expected dividend yield among others in addition we estimate the number of options expected to eventually vest expected volatility estimates are based on implied volatilities from traded options on textron common stock historical volatilities and other factors textron uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected life

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

interest rate risks 

  

our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt and vice versa the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate debt we continuously monitor our mix of floating and fixedrate debt and adjust the mix as necessary based on our evaluation of internal and external factors the difference between the rates textron manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2005 2004 or 2003 

  

within the finance segment a strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities limits our risk to changes in interest rates this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at december 31 2005 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 156 million net of 29 billion of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixedrate debt to a floatingrate equivalent and 122 million of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixedrate finance receivables to a floatingrate equivalent for textron finance interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by 11 million 40 million and 43 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

foreign exchange risks 

  

our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured andor sold for 2005 the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2004 increased revenues by approximately 31 million 04 and decreased segment profit by approximately 3 million 04 

  

textron manufacturing manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset during 2005 textron manufacturing primarily used borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 

  

in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures textron manufacturing also enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts these contracts are generally used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately 699 million at the end of 2005 and 493 million at the end of 2004 

  

quantitative risk measures 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments we utilize a sensitivity analysis the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables debt excluding lease obligations interest rate exchange agreements foreign exchange contracts marketable equity securities and marketable security price forward contracts 

  

presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at yearend we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10 decrease in interest rates a 10 strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a 10 decrease in the quoted market prices of applicable marketable equity securities

changes in internal controls – on january 2 2005 textron engaged a thirdparty service provider to assume operational control and day to day management of textron’s information technology infrastructure during the fourth quarter of 2005 textron continued its transfer of operational control and day to day management of its information technology infrastructure to the thirdparty service provider the thirdparty service provider has responsibilities under textron’s oversight for managing textron’s networks and help desks and maintaining mainframes midrange servers and workstations located at both textron and the thirdparty service provider locations this transfer has materially affected textron’s internal control over financial reporting related to its information technology infrastructure we believe that we have taken appropriate actions to ensure that effective internal controls over financial reporting associated with the transfer have been and will continue to be maintained during the transition period

reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognized future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive loss as appropriate 

  

  

  

  

  

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in prior carryback years the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

  

  

  

  

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations new regulatory or judicial pronouncements or other relevant events as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

  

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

  

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas 123r requires companies to measure compensation costs for sharebased payments to employees including stock options at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition textron is required to adopt sfas 123r in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 under sfas 123r companies must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options management is evaluating the requirements of sfas 123r management believes the impact of adopting sfas 123rwill result in additional expense of approximately 15 million net of income taxes for 2005 this estimate is subject to change based on a number of factors including the actual number of stock option awards granted changes in assumptions underlying the option value estimates such as the riskfree interest rate and tax deductions for employee disqualifying dispositions if any 

  

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

  

  

  

  

interest rate risks 

  

  

textron’s financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates as part of managing this risk textron enters into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt and vice versa the overall objective of textron’s interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixedrate debt textron’s mix of floating and fixedrate debt is continuously monitored by management and is adjusted as necessary based on evaluation of internal and external factors the difference between the rates textron manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2004 2003 or 2002 

  

  

  

  

  

within its finance segment textron’s strategy of matching floatingrate assets with floatingrate liabilities limits its risk to changes in interest rates this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements at january 1 2005 floatingrate liabilities in excess of floatingrate assets were 421 million net of 20 billion of interest rate exchange agreements on fixedrate longterm debt and 168 million of interest rate exchange agreements on fixedrate finance receivables for textron finance interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by 40 million 43 million and 20 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively
