national security cutters 

the us coast guards recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expansive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline the flagship of this program is the legend class nsc a multimission platform we designed and continue to build we delivered uscgc kimball nsc 7 uscgc midgett nsc 8 and uscgc stone nsc 9 to the us coast guard in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2018 we were awarded longleadtime material and construction contracts for calhoun nsc 10 and friedman nsc 11 which are currently under construction 

newport news 

the core business of our newport news segment is designing and constructing nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our newport news shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

design construction refueling and complex overhaul and inactivation of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers cvn are core to newport news operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has designed and built more than 31 aircraft carriers for the us navy since 1933 including all ten nimitz class cvn 68 aircraft carriers currently in active service as well as the first ship of the next generation gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

  

beginning in 2009 we received contract awards totaling 78 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier john f kennedy cvn 79 in addition we have received awards valued at 153 billion for detail design and construction of the gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers enterprise cvn 80 and doris miller cvn 81 

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes nearly four years to complete with the work accounting for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and fleet support across the globe 

we are currently performing the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and uss john c stennis cvn 74 we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our rcoh performance on the first seven nimitz class cvn 68 carriers our highly trained workforce the capitalintensive nature of rcoh work and high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for rcoh contract awards on the remaining nimitz class cvn 68 carriers as well as future rcoh work on gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

we received a contract in 2013 to inactivate the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 inactivation was completed in the second quarter of 2018 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten nimitz class cvn 68 carriers we delivered that are currently in active service as well as gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans we believe we are well positioned as the us navys shipyard of choice for these contract awards 

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 62 submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 48 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines of the 52 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 25 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

virginia class ssn 774 submarines 

we have a teaming agreement with electric boat corporation electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build virginia class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines under the teaming arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines to the us navy alternates between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and six submarines of the second block of virginia class ssn 774 submarines have been delivered in december 2008 the us navy signed a contract for eight block iii virginia class ssn 774 submarines the contract required delivery of one virginia class ssn 774 submarine per year for the first two years and increased production to two submarines per year for the remaining six block iii boats the first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014 and the last submarine of block iii was delivered in 2019 in 2014 the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten virginia class ssn 774 submarines the first submarine of the block iv contract was delivered in 2020 and the remaining boats are in the module outfitting final assembly and test phases of construction in 2019 the team was awarded a construction contract for the fifth block of nine virginia class ssn 774 submarines and in 2021 an option for a 10th submarine was exercised continuing the two submarines per year production rate that began on the third block the fiscal year 2021 appropriations act included funding for the 10th submarine in block v and the fiscal year 2022 national defense authorization act recommends continued procurement of two virginia class ssn 774 submarines per fiscal year all ten boats of the block v contract are in the early manufacturing and advance procurement phases 

columbia class ssbn 826 submarines 

newport news is participating in design and construction of the columbia class ssbn 826 submarine as a replacement for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 the ohio class ssbn includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the columbia class ssbn 826 program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines we perform design work as a subcontractor to electric boat and we have entered into a teaming agreement with electric boat to build modules for the entire columbia class ssbn 826 submarine program that leverages our virginia class ssn 774 experience we were previously awarded contracts from electric boat to begin integrated product and process development and provide long–leadtime material and advance construction for the columbia class ssbn 826 program contract award for the first two columbia class submarines ssbn 826 and ssbn 827 and construction start of the first columbia class ssbn 826 submarine occurred in late 2020 

naval nuclear support services 

newport news provides additional services to and in support of the us navy ranging from services supporting the navys carrier and submarine fleets to maintenance services at us navy training facilities fleet support services include design construction maintenance and disposal activities for inservice us navy nuclear ships worldwide through mobile and inhouse capabilities we also provide maintenance services on nuclear reactor prototypes such as those at the kenneth a kesselring site a research and development facility in new york that supports the us navy 

technical solutions 

the technical solutions segment includes businesses that are focused on lifecycle sustainment services to the us navy fleet and other maritime customers highend information technology “it” and missionbased solutions for dod intelligence and federal civilian customers and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the department of energy doe dod state and local governments and private sector 

companies this segment was established to unify multiple strategic acquisitions including the acquisition of alion science and technology in august 2021 the technical solutions segment is comprised of three business units as follows 

defense and federal solutions “dfs” 

dfs is focused on solving national security challenges for the dod the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies around the globe the group’s expertise includes maritime fleet sustainment intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance cyber operations secure enterprise information technology engineering and operations advanced modeling simulation and training and logistics management 

nuclear and environmental services 

our nuclear and environmental services focus on nuclear management and operations we provide site management nuclear and industrial facilities operations and maintenance decontamination and decommissioning and radiological and hazardous waste management services to doe dod state and local governments and private sector companies as part of our nuclear and environmental services we participate in joint ventures including newport news nuclear bwxt los alamos llc n3b mission support and test services llc msts and savannah river nuclear solutions llc srns we have a 51 ownership interest in n3b which in 2017 was awarded the los alamos legacy cleanup contract at the doenational nuclear security administration’s los alamos national laboratory located northwest of santa fe new mexico we have a 23 ownership interest in msts which in 2017 was awarded a contract for site management and operations at the nevada national security site located northwest of las vegas nevada we have a 34 ownership interest in srns which provides site management and operations at the does savannah river site near aiken south carolina 

unmanned systems 

our unmanned systems products and services create advanced unmanned maritime solutions for defense marine research and commercial applications serving customers in more than 30 countries unmanned systems provides design autonomy manufacturing testing operations and sustainment of unmanned systems including unmanned underwater vehicles and unmanned surface vessels 

customers 

our revenues are primarily derived from the us government including the us navy the us coast guard the dod the doe and other federal agencies in 2021 2020 and 2019 approximately 90 88 and 87 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy 

intellectual property 

we develop new technologies that are incorporated into the products we produce for our customers we also develop new manufacturing processes and systemsintegration technologies and processes that we use to produce our products and to provide services to our customers in addition to owning intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize other parties to use the intellectual property we license to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

backlog 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our total backlog was approximately 485 billion and 460 billion respectively we expect approximately 19 of backlog at december 31 2021 to be converted into sales in 2022 

raw materials 

the most significant material we use is steel other materials we use in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government for longterm contracts we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

regulatory matters 

we operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations including those relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts as well as legal and regulatory requirements relating to cyber security environmental protection and our nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks see risk factors in item 1a 

government contracting 

we are overseen and audited by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges 

our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems government property management systems estimating systems earned value management systems and material management accounting systems the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems although this has not materially impacted the timing of our cash receipts in the past any such action by the us government in the future could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

our contracts with the us government sometimes result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon 

at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities reas can result in claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 in cases in which we cannot reach agreement with the us government 

us government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government and certain costs are not allowable and therefore not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts costs we incur that are not allowable under the federal acquisition regulation the “far” or us cost accounting standards “cas” or that are otherwise determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

our business including contracts with us government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the far the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cas the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment we are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations which increase our costs and compliance risks and may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to damage claims substantial fines and other penalties 

nuclear 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the us nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and the doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

environmental 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

we accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations make future environmental remediation costs difficult to estimate and can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental legal requirements but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations we do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

competitive environment 

in our business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and in the case of certain nonnuclear shipbuilding programs smaller shipyards the smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors intense competition related to programs resources funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our shipbuilding business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our shipbuilding markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

while we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard we are one of only two companies currently capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to longterm teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both virginia class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines and columbia class ssbn 826 ballistic missile submarines we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for surface combatant ships as well 

our technical solutions segment delivers technologybased products and solutions to government and commercial services markets in which we compete with a wide range of companies supporting the us government and its allies worldwide 

our success depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at costs consistent with our customers expectations as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

human capital resources 

we recognize that our employees are our most important assets and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives our employees are critical to driving operational execution meeting customer expectations providing strong financial performance advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success 

we have approximately 44000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 7300 engineers and designers and approximately 3600 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1500 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2021 we had 1190 master shipbuilders at newport news and 284 at ingalls we also employ more than 7500 veterans across the enterprise 

in addition over 900 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding divisions from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives we employ approximately 4500 apprentice school alumni comprised of 3061 at newport news and 1487 at ingalls 

approximately 45 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement newport news has two collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in december 2022 and april 2024 and one that expired in november 2021 which covers 

approximately 50 of newport news employees newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2026 approximately 15 technical solutions employees in klamath falls oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in june 2025 

we reached a tentative agreement with representatives of united steelworkers “usw” local 8888 newport news members on a new labor agreement in november 2021 but the members of the bargaining unit declined to ratify the contract the newport news and usw negotiation teams continued negotiations and reached a tentative agreement on another labor agreement in january 2022 we expect the members of the bargaining unit to vote on the new agreement in the near future the usw local 8888 members are continuing to work under the terms and conditions of the expired collective bargaining agreement but the members may call for a strike or we may declare a lockout upon 48 hours notice we cannot give any assurances that the tentative labor agreement will be ratified by the local bargaining unit or that a strike or lockout will not occur 

we have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 22 years at newport news and more than 14 years at ingalls we are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory 

the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and develop a skilled and diverse workforce of talented and highperforming employees at all levels of our organization to succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor we have developed key workforce development recruitment and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business these strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs policies and initiatives 

competitive pay and benefits  our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract retain and motivate employees to achieve our objectives 

• we provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions skill levels experience knowledge and geographic location 

• we utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry 

• the structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both shortterm and longterm performance and we align our executive longterm equity compensation metrics with longterm shareholder interests 

• employees are eligible for health insurance paid and unpaid leaves 401k plans and life and disabilityaccident insurance coverage we also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs including annual leavepaid time off paid holidays flexible work arrangementsschedules telemedicine parental leave transgender medical coverage and a wellness program that includes physical mental and financial wellness components we also fund the operation of family health centers near our two shipyards which provide a full range of medical lab pharmacy dental physical therapy and vision services 

recruitment training and workforce development  our three segments hire thousands of employees each year in 2021 we hired nearly 6000 new employees to help us meet this large demand for talent we have worked to create develop and maintain multiple talent pipelines one of the key components of our approach to workforce development is to “grow our own” we operate two apprentice schools one at ingalls and one at newport news the newport news apprentice school was founded in 1919 and the ingalls apprentice school was founded in 1952 

the two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 14000 graduates since their inceptions the schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our crafttrades and technical workforces as well as developing the future leaders of our company the ingalls apprentice school has partnered with the mississippi gulf coast community college to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate’s degree the newport news apprentice school has partnered with two community colleges as well as old dominion university to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering electrical engineering or modeling  simulation 

in addition to operating our own apprentice schools we have developed and nurtured multiple partnerships with state and local governments prek education providers primarysecondary school districts community colleges and fouryear colleges and universities as well as postgraduate institutions we also make significant investments through monetary contributions leadership time and employee volunteer hours to support these critical partnerships 

we maintain effective partnerships with colleges and universities military bases for transitioning veterans and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering it and other technical talent working closely with state and local government leaders we have successfully facilitated local regional and statewide workforce development and education initiatives that include prek programs high school trades programstalent development labs prehire tradestechnical community college programs internscoops with colleges and universities adult trades programs veterans and military spouses training programs and unemployedunderemployed training programs 

we view our workforce development process as a “leadership factory” and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks since our founding in 2011 we have followed our succession plans 80 of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position and we have filled 77 of newly created vice president positions with internal hires 

environmental health  safety “ehs”  the health safety and wellbeing of our employees together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise we prioritize manage and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental safety and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at doe sites on which technical solutions segment employees work 

safety goals are included in operational metrics for purposes of the newport news and ingalls compensation programs we also use a wide variety of training courses prejob “take five” crew talks medical surveillance programs and employee involvement efforts to keep our workforce focused on ehs at newport news and ingalls a key component of our ehs program is the utilization of health and safety teams which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and frontline managers whose goal is to educate engage and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury illness and environmental impacts we employ programs focused on identifying reporting and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize evaluate and control hazards 

we track several metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance one of the key metrics is total case rate “tcr” which is the number of occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injuries per 100 equivalent employees the tcr for newport news was 564 in 2021 477 in 2020 and 467 in 2019 and the tcr at ingalls was 626 in 2021 635 in 2020 and 659 in 2019 newport news also tracks days away restricted or transferred “dart” which is the number of osha recordable cases in which the employee is unable to work cannot work due to a restriction or can work with a restriction as a result of an injury per 100 equivalent employees dart at newport news was 445 in 2021 341 in 2020 and 301 in 2019 ingalls tracks two other safety metrics lost time case rate “ltcr” which is the number of employees that lost work time per 100 employees and lost work day rate “lwdr” which is the number of lost workdays per 100 fulltime employees the ltcr and lwdr at ingalls were 275 and 7632 respectively in 2021 253 and 5637 respectively in 2020 and 239 and 5682 respectively in 2019 

in connection with the outbreak of covid19 the dod designated newport news and ingalls as critical infrastructure industry our production and support workforce therefore continued inperson work at our facilities to provide vital products and services to our government customers while many of our employees in support and administrative functions effectively worked remotely from midmarch 2020 until our employees generally returned to our facilities in may 2021 prior to the covid19 pandemic less than 400 of our employees regularly worked remotely and at our peak more than 11300 employees were working remotely 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented mitigation measures to protect our employees and customers and support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we perform onsite covid19 testing provide onsite vaccinations for employees perform extensive cleaning and sanitation services for our shops ships and offices reengineered how some work was performed in order to support social distancing requirements and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for employees in our support and administrative functions 

corporate values  we operate on a set of values that are shared with all employees integrity safety respect engagement responsibility and performance always doing the right thing is an essential belief at hii that tone starts at the top and permeates through the culture of the company it is a set of core values standards and behaviors that guide employee commitment to the highest ethical standards and serves as the underlying framework for all of our human capital strategies 

advancing and celebrating diversity and inclusion “di”  we believe we gain a key competitive advantage by building a workforce community that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds skills and experiences regardless of race ethnicity color religion sex disability nationality or other differentiation and our leaders leverage the differences within their teams we also believe di is vital to our ability to grow and innovate in an everchanging fastpaced environment our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas which we believe enables better business decisions the following are highlights of our di program

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

industry and economic risk factors 

we depend on the us government for substantially all of our business and risks that arise from conducting business with the us government could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial majority of our business consists of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships and nonnuclear ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy we also provide fleet sustainment services to the us navy it and missionbased solutions for the dod and intelligence and federal civilian customers and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the doe and dod substantially all of our revenues in 2021 were derived from products and services sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition substantially all of our backlog as of december 31 2021 was us government related our us government contracts are subject to various risks including customer political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customer shortterm and longterm strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract award and funding competition difficulty forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain legal or regulatory violations any of these factors could affect our business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional funding of us navy us coast guard and other government agency programs under the normal legislative process congress completes 12 annual appropriation bills each fiscal year to fund the activities of federal agencies when congress is unable to pass these appropriation bills before the beginning of a fiscal year a continuing resolution can be enacted to provide stopgap funding for a specified period of time at a specified rate often the prior year’s appropriation level when the us government operates under a continuing resolution limitations can be placed on production increases multiyear procurements and new program starts which may result in delays or cancellation of new contract awards when the us government fails to enact annual appropriations or a continuing resolution a full or partial federal government shutdown may occur a federal government shutdown could in turn result in the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations 

for certain programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years such programs are funded initially on a partial basis and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may not recover those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual contracts or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels including defense spending will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by shifts in customer priorities resulting from changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for less expensive alternatives and the increasing proliferation of advanced weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2021 our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes to customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

as of december 31 2021 our total backlog was 485 billion including 227 billion in funded backlog the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for the us governments convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contracts that may never be realized as revenues any termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

our industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from greater focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of defense funds to key areas for future defense spending these initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way us government contracts are solicited negotiated and managed and may impact whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the us government including the terms and conditions under which we do so which may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award fee criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that mandate our costs may affect our profitability and the predictability of our profit rates the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to contractors 

for example the dod is increasingly pursuing accelerated development and acquisition of new technologies through rapid acquisition pathways and procedures including through other transaction authority agreements “otas” in recent years the dod has increased the frequency of use and size of otas and we expect this trend to continue in the future otas are exempt from many traditional procurement laws including the far and may be used subject to certain conditions for research prototype development and followon production for a successful prototype the conditions for ota awards include in certain instances that a significant portion of the work under the ota be performed by a nontraditional defense contractor or that a portion of the cost of the protoype project be funded by nongovernmental sources if we cannot successfully adapt to the dod’s accelerated acquisition processes or if the dod significantly increases the use of otas with nontraditional defense contractors or increases cost sharing mandates then we may lose new strategic business opportunities in highgrowth areas and our future performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition to the dods business practice initiatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize cost recoverysavings as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits moreover the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs or the allowability of certain costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict a longer term reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 295 ships as of december 31 2021 has resulted in workforce reductions but limited infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards five major private united states shipyards two of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for contracts to build surface combatants  submarines and large deck amphibious ships and smaller shipyards have entered the market for surface combatants we may compete in the future with the same contractor and other shipyards to build new and different classes of ships as well as ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard became capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which can reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

changes in estimates used in contract accounting could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgments relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed which subjects our risk assessments revenue and cost estimates and assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our judgment  estimation  and assumption processes are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can result if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see the contracts section under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2021 we had 26 billion of debt under our senior notes  625 million of term loan debt 105 million of revenue bonds  15 billion of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and  1 billion of borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program our 

revolving credit facility also allows us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing capacity in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1 billion and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our current or future indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations financings or asset sales which may be subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other unfavorable actions including reducing financing for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes reducing our cash dividend rate andor share repurchases or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness in addition our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense industry could be impaired in the event of a default on any of our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

the interest rates on variable rate indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based upon the london interbank offered rate “libor” libor has been the subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in march 2021 libor’s regulator the uk financial conduct authority announced that the publication of rates for oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor maturities and all nonus libor maturities would cease immediately after december 31 2021 with all other tenors ceasing immediately after june 30 2023 in the us the alternative reference rate committee has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative upon termination of libor although other alternatives including bloomberg’s shortterm bank yield are available we cannot predict the consequences of the benchmark transition from libor to sofr or another benchmark but the transition may potentially increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

business and operational risk factors 

cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that does not result in higher contract value due from customers reduces our profit and exposes us to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial contract cost estimates reasons may include labor unavailability or reduced productivity the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover costs and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends upon the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and material contracts under firm fixedprice contracts we agree to perform the specified work for a predetermined price to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss some firm fixedprice contracts have a performancebased component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based upon our performance fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract subject to a costshare limit that impacts the profit on the contract costtype contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded under time and material contracts we are paid for direct labor hours incurred at specified hourly rates plus material costs see the contracts section under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 for descriptions of the types of contracts that comprise our business 

approximately 55 of our revenues in 2021 were generated under fixedprice incentive contracts approximately 39 were generated under costtype contracts approximately 3 were generated under time and material contracts and approximately 3 were generated under firm fixedprice contracts our failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance 

under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs our operating results could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to negotiate an increase in contract value to our customers from time to time we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a nottoexceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support us government priorities uncertainties in final contract price specifications and terms or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform our contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the timing of product deliveries and other matters we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections contract performance schedule delays and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials  major components and subsystems  hardware elements  and subassemblies for our products and perform certain services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including various dod cybersecurity requirements disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or misalignments between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to satisfy our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide agreedupon products or materials or perform agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or they otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to meet expectations could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental support to our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts including as a result of increases in material costs although we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions the difference in basis between our actual material costs and industry indices may expose us to cost recovery risk significant increases in inflation particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials may increase our cost recovery risk in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part on a timely compliant and costeffective basis could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to provide quality materials and services to support our programs and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and the expectations set forth in the hii supplier code of conduct in some circumstances we rely on representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also conduct technical assessments inspections and audits as necessary with subcontractors and suppliers notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving materials and services that fail to meet specifications or requirements subcontractors and suppliers sometimes provide us with unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services 

our inability to procure or a significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or noncompliant materials components or parts from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts in turn our performance depends upon our ability to develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and other employees with the necessary skills and security clearances at the same time future revenues and costs impact our ability to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear related and other specialized skills and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business shortages of qualified personnel can increase our recruiting training and overall labor costs and a failure to attract and retain qualified personnel can impact our contract performance and ability to compete for new contracts 

many of our contracts include performance obligations that incorporate innovative designs and stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include new technologies or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet performance expectations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services that often involve innovative designs new technologies and complex manufacturing processes problems and delays with product development technology implementation manufacturing or subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technologies supplied by the us navy or other contractors or developed by us problems developing or implementing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design and construction schedule the risks associated with new technologies or design changes during construction can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery delays in receipt of necessary customer information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which can adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of elements that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unexpected degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or customer indemnification diversion of management attention loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts reimbursement to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to determine the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in key estimates and assumptions associated with postretirement benefit plans such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets which to a large extent are reflective of the financial markets and economic conditions changes to these estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets could significantly impact our retirement related expense the funded status of benefit plans and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans which could have material adverse effects on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally pension cost recoveries under cas for our us government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or the periods in which we make contributions to our benefit plans and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries 

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and floods the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change other impacts of climate change including rising sea waters and environmental disasters such as oil spills natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations which can adversely affect our contract performance and as a result our financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water we use for transporting and testing our ships can cause schedule delays under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

we face risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks and our business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of covid19 such risks include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work or work effectively temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers and delays in supplier deliveries we have experienced higher employee absentee rates as a result of covid19 which has impacted our operations and financial results higher absentee rates attributable to covid19 including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions resulting from covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact performance on our contracts and have increased and may continue to increase our costs these impacts may continue and the cost increases may not be fully recoverable under our contracts or adequately covered by insurance which could impact our profitability 

covid19 has also caused disruption in our supply chain caused delays in and limited the ability of the us government and other customers to perform which have included delays in contract award decisions and caused other unpredictable events some or all of these impacts might continue into the future 

in september 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring certain employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated in accordance with the guidelines of the safer federal workforce task force in november 2021 osha issued an emergency temporary standard “ets” requiring that all employers with 100 or more employees mandate vaccines for covered employees or in the alternative weekly testing and masks the us federal contractor mandate was preliminarily enjoined by several us federal district courts the us supreme court preliminarily stayed the osha ets in january 2022 and osha subsequently withdrew the ets 

while we are not currently subject to any vaccine mandate it continues to be our policy to encourage each of our employees to be fully vaccinated against covid19 to the extent we become subject to a vaccine mandate in the future our implementation of the mandate could result in employee attrition including attrition of critical skilled labor and difficulty meeting future labor requirements if attrition is significant our operations and ability to execute our contracts could be materially impacted in addition our subcontractors and suppliers who become subject to a vaccine mandate could be impacted by an inability to comply or loss of personnel which could disrupt subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries and negatively impact our business 

covid19 has already impacted our business and results of operations and the ultimate impact of covid19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods including our ability to execute our programs on the expected schedule remains uncertain and will depend on future covid19 related developments including the duration of the pandemic potential subsequent waves of covid19 infection or potential new variants the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the impacts of implementation of vaccine mandates and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread all of which continue to be uncertain and cannot be predicted as a result we cannot predict the full impact of covid19 but it could materially affect our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows in the future 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 45  of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement newport news has two collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in december 2022 and april 2024 and one that expired in november 2021 which covers approximately 50 of newport news employees newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2026 approximately 15 technical solutions employees in klamath falls oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in june 2025 

we reached a tentative agreement with representatives of united steelworkers “usw” local 8888 newport news members on a new labor agreement in november 2021 but the members of the bargaining unit declined to ratify the contract the newport news and usw negotiation teams continued negotiations and reached a tentative agreement on another labor agreement in january 2022 we expect the members of the bargaining unit to vote on the new agreement in the near future the usw local 8888 members are continuing to work under the terms and conditions of the expired collective bargaining agreement but the members may call for a strike or we may declare a lockout upon 48 hours notice we cannot give any assurances that the tentative labor agreement will be ratified by the local bargaining unit or that a strike or lockout will not occur 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have experienced in the past work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

we could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols and implement security controls and complementary cyber security technologies in compliance with industry requirements we face substantial cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information from advanced nation state threat actors sophisticated cybercrime syndicates hacktivists and insiders while we implement countermeasures to address the risks posed by these threats external and internal threat actors continuously seek to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure assets and data 

our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners also face cyber security and other security threats although we undertake cooperative efforts with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to facilitate their understanding of cyber security threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to mitigate potential cyberattacks other security threats and business disruptions we rely substantially on the safeguards implemented by these organizations which may affect the security of our information these organizations have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

in addition to cyber threats operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security issues such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions involve estimates assumptions and judgments to arrive at acquisition prices which are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our acquisition and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from expectations in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses 

as of december 31 2021 goodwill and purchased intangible assets from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 25 and 11 respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or unfavorable changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

  

legal and regulatory risk factors 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to award administration and performance of us government contracts as well as legal and regulatory requirements relating to cyber security environmental protection and our nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks and change on a routine basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in further performance and compliance requirements and higher costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance costs and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we are overseen and audited by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause significant reputational damage 

the us   government also has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems which can have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts for example in january 2022 the navy contracting officer issued a written determination that the ingalls shipbuilding material management and accounting system has three significant deficiencies resulting in a 5 withhold of payments on certain invoices issued under one contract ingalls shipbuilding will submit a corrective action plan and the withhold will be reduced to 2 if the contracting officer determines the corrective action plan has been implemented and is effective the withhold will terminate and withheld funds returned to the company when the contracting officer determines that the significant deficiencies have been corrected 

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed which sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the dfars the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cas if a determination is made that we engaged in illegal activities or that we are not presently responsible as defined under the far we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs and may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to damages claims substantial fines or other penalties 

environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge storage treatment handling disposal and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes used in our operations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more federal regional andor international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and legislation international protocols or treaties or regulation could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future laws and regulations for environmental protection and remediation and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental requirements and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging in accordance with applicable permits to manage these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of above ground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to the negligence or fault of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties moreover if we violate the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental or climate change laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental matters our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we have been impacted in the past by the misconduct of employees and business partners and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors moreover the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand our operations into foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage 

our nuclear operations subject us to environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

• potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials including nuclear assemblies and their components 

• unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance operations security and repairs including repairs required by the us navy the nuclear regulatory commission or the doe 

• reputational damage 

• potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control and 

• regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations 

failure to properly store handle and dispose of nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of remedial actions taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could require substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

changes in us federal or state or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including those with retroactive effect could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows for example beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five years if these provisions are not deferred modified or repealed by congress with retroactive effect to january 1 2022 they will decrease our cash from operations beginning in 2022 we currently estimate an approximately 100 million impact to 2022 cash from operations based on the provisions currently in effect the actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on whether and when these provisions are deferred modified or repealed by congress including any retroactive application and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors in addition recent proposals to increase the us corporate income tax rate would require us to increase our net deferred tax liabilities upon enactment of new tax legislation with a corresponding material onetime noncash increase in deferred income tax expense our current income tax expense and payments would likely materially increase in periods subsequent to the income tax rate change 

in addition to future changes in tax laws the amount of net deferred tax liabilities will change periodically as a result of a number of factors including the measurement of our defined benefit pension plans actual cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans changes in the timing of contract taxable income and changes in the amount and timing of depreciation deductions we are also regularly under audit or examination by taxing authorities including 

foreign tax authorities the final determination of tax liabilities and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows 

we are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring future material cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax proceedings compliance proceedings customer claims and audits and investigations which can divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary sanctions government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim audit or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future see note 14 investigations claims and litigation in item 8 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property the us government is taking increasingly aggressive positions both as to the intellectual property to which they believe government use rights apply and to the acquisition of broad license rights if the us government is successful in these efforts our intellectual property on which we depend and our access to and use of certain supplier intellectual property could be negatively affected 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however adequately protect the trade secrets on which we depend 

our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we also use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in the case of such licensed intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property or to secure the licenses on commercially reasonable terms 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could reduce our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy as a result our navy contracts include notice and approval rights for the navy and conditions regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our naval nuclear operations in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and receive the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders 

general risk factors 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to insure our significant risks and potential liabilities that are insurable including among others property loss from natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage we can reasonably purchase may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of our actual losses or liabilities including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business can make it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact and loss resulting from such events limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in substantial uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases for which we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier an unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors 

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and as a result our ability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in us incurring significant incremental costs and delays 

if we fail to manage acquisitions divestitures equity investments and other transactions including our acquisition of alion successfully or if acquired entities or equity investments fail to perform as expected our financial results business and future prospects could be harmed 

as part of our business strategy we identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and investments when evaluating such transactions we make significant judgments regarding the values of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of strategic acquisitions we often 

compete with other potential buyers for the same opportunities to be successful we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete and close complex transactions integrate acquired companies and employees and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively acquisition divestiture joint venture and investment transactions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business unidentified or identified but unindemnified preclosing liabilities could affect our future financial results particularly through successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the false claims act or truth in negotiations act anticorruption environmental tax importexport and technology transfer laws which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities employee retention transactionrelated or other litigation and other liabilities any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

joint ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties these investments typically face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do but may also expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control a joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with our interests and we may be unable to prevent strategic decisions that may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we also could be adversely affected by or liable for actions taken by these joint ventures that we do not control including violations of anticorruption import and export taxation and antiboycott laws 

there can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels 

the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors considered in the context of then current conditions including our earnings other operating results and capital requirements declines in asset values or increases in liabilities including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes can reduce stockholders’ equity a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future in addition the timing and amount of share repurchases under boardapproved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors including our share price results of operations capital requirements and general business conditions as well as applicable law

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

covid19 pandemic  the covid19 global pandemic has had wideranging effects on the global health environment and disrupted the global and us economies and financial markets including impacts to our employees customers suppliers and communities collectively “covid19 events” covid19 events have also 

impacted our operations and the extent of future impacts are uncertain the most significant areas of impact have been the disruption of our employees’ ability to work effectively disruption in our supply chain disruption of the us governments and our other customers abilities to perform their obligations and impact on pension assets and other investment performance 

in september 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring certain employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated in accordance with the guidelines of the safer federal workforce task force in november 2021 osha issued an emergency temporary standard “ets” requiring that all employers with 100 or more employees mandate vaccines for covered employees or in the alternative weekly testing and masks the us federal contractor mandate was preliminarily enjoined by several us federal district courts the us supreme court preliminarily stayed the osha ets in january 2022 and osha subsequently withdrew the ets 

while we are not currently subject to any vaccine mandate it continues to be our policy to encourage each of our employees to be fully vaccinated against covid19 to the extent we become subject to a vaccine mandate in the future our implementation of the mandate could result in employee attrition including attrition of critical skilled labor and difficulty meeting future labor requirements 

see risk factors in item 1a for a discussion of covid19related risks 

we have aggressively managed our response to the uncertainties regarding covid19 events and we have incurred costs to respond to covid19 events including paid leave quarantining employees vaccinations and recurring facility cleaning our shipyards and other facilities have remained open and productive but we continue to experience decreases in workforce attendance and challenges meeting our hiring requirements which has impacted our operations due to delay and disruption from a shortage of critical skills and outofsequence work 

under section 3610 of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act contractors may submit claims for employee paid time off caused by restrictions from covid19 events in circumstances where the employee could not work remotely such instances may include paid time off for employees to allow for plant decontamination idle time due to social distancing restrictions paid time off to take care of dependents impacted by governmentordered school or day care closures paid time for employee vaccinations or responding to side effects from vaccination and employee quarantines due to travel restrictions or coming into contact being diagnosed or taking care of someone diagnosed with covid19 we have taken steps to preserve our rights to pursue such claims for hii and our subcontractors and we submitted an initial section 3610 reimbursement request to the dod for ingalls and newport news shipbuilding section 3610 under the cares act was not extended past september 30 2021 we anticipate submitting supplemental requests for section 3610 reimbursement for hii and our subcontractors into 2022 reimbursements of our requests are contingent upon contracting officers making funding available and most dod contracting officers are awaiting supplemental appropriations from congress before approving such reimbursement requests we have no assurance that congress will appropriate sufficient funds to cover the reimbursement of costs contemplated by the cares act 

while costs related to covid19 events are allowable under us government contracts our contract estimates reflect margin impact uncertainty because such costs may not result in equitable adjustments particularly on firm fixedprice and fixedprice incentive contracts or may not be adequately covered by insurance our reinsurers have failed to acknowledge coverage for various losses related to covid19 and we filed a complaint in state court in vermont seeking a judgment declaring that our business interruption and other losses associated with covid19 are covered by our property insurance program we also initiated arbitration proceedings against other reinsurers seeking similar relief the vermont court dismissed our complaint in response to a motion of the reinsurers for judgment on the pleadings and we have appealed the decision although we continue to believe that our position is wellfounded no assurance can be provided regarding the ultimate resolution of this matter see note 14 investigations claims and litigation in item 8 

we have also focused on actively supporting our customers suppliers and communities we have been proactive in engaging with our us government customers regarding future contract adjustments while there has been no change in contract terms or substantial degradation in timely payments from customers we have experienced delays in decisions on certain contract awards we are unable to predict how our customers will allocate resources in the future as they react to the evolving demands of the covid19 response we also accelerated payments to small business suppliers in an effort to minimize supply chain disruption 

we temporarily halted stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 but we resumed share repurchases during the first quarter of 2021 we also deferred certain payroll taxes in 2020 pursuant to the cares act which increased our cash from operations in 2020 but will reduce cash from operations in 2021 and 2022 

us government contracts  longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure 

the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2022 was enacted in december 2021 and broadly supports our shipbuilding programs including increased funding authority for arleigh burke class destroyers ddg51 lha and lpd flight ii amphibious ships and submarine supplier development assistance however more than one quarter into the fiscal year congressional appropriations for the federal government have yet to be finalized consequently the us government is currently operating under a continuing resolution cr that funds government operations through february 18 2022 it remains uncertain at this point whether fiscal year 2022 government operations will require additional shortterm funding or annual appropriations measures will be finalized prior to the expiration of the cr appropriations measures must be passed by congress and enacted by the president and we cannot predict the outcome of the fiscal year 2022 budget process 

longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the federal budget environment remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending the defense industrial base including hii and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on hii and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment upon assuming office in 2021 the biden administration released a broad interim national security strategy that lays out the contours of us foreign policy over the next four years under this strategy the indopacific region remains at the heart of us defense planning while the united states continues to face security challenges from russia north korea and nonstate extremism other ‘nontraditional’ threats such as pandemic disease and climate change are now part of the national security dialogue 

the us also faces a more lethal and disruptive battlefield combined across domains and conducted at increasing speed and reach the security environment is affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war the drive to develop new capabilities and enhance lethality is relentless expanding to address emerging threats from peercompetitors as well as actors with lower barriers of entry and moving at accelerating speed to address these rapidlyevolving threats the us is investing in new capabilities and lethality enhancements including unmanned and autonomous systems and platforms artificial intelligence hypersonics directed energy resilient networks command control communications computers cyber intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and targeting requirements and microelectronics technologies are being prioritized that can penetrate and operate inside highlycontested and highlydefended territory both physical and cyber 

in late december 2020 the us navy marine corps and coast guard released a triservice maritime strategy titled advantage at sea  the document provides strategic guidance on how the sea services will prevail in daytoday competition crisis and conflict over the next decade the strategy directs the services to pursue an agile and aggressive approach to force modernization and experimentation by combining legacy assets with new capabilities 

to understand faster decide faster and act faster the strategy also emphasizes the need to develop new operational concepts for fielded capabilities employ resilient and integrated networks across the force leverage the strengths of regional partners and expand the use of optionally manned and unmanned platforms 

in january 2021 the chief of naval operations released a navigation plan to the fleet that nests under the triservice maritime strategy and outlines how the us navy will grow its naval power to control the seas and project power across all domains it lays out what must be done this decade to deliver the naval power america needs to compete and win characterized as a ready fleet a more lethal and betterconnected fleet and a larger more hybrid fleet to this end the marine corps is also reshaping its force under the commandant’s force design 2030 guidance to become optimized for modern operations by 2030 the marine corps has already taken action to eliminate legacy capabilities such as battle tanks and a future force may feature an expanded assortment of smaller platforms landing craft and connectors that are manned minimally manned and unmanned and exploit autonomy and artificial intelligence 

we anticipate the us navy’s force projection strategy will continue to emphasize sea control and sea denial enabling power projection against adversaries with longrange weapons and fullspectrum joint domain capabilities the navy will likely continue to employ the evolving concept of distributed maritime operations dmo which features multiple sensors and shooters that are widely dispersed across a broad range of manned and unmanned platforms and linked through resilient networks naval forces are participating in a larger dodwide objective to modernize command and control architecture the concept to connect sensors from all of the military services into a single network known as joint alldomain command and control jadc2 future conflicts may require leaders to analyze the operating environment and make decisions rapidly with jadc2 dod envisions creating an “internet of things” network that would connect numerous sensors with weapons systems using artificial intelligence algorithms to help improve decisionmaking project overmatch is the navy’s effort to develop the networks infrastructure data architecture and analytics to participate in this larger networked military operating environment the endstate for the “future navy” envisions a fleet designed to ensure the wholeness of combat capability and lethal forces maximizing the benefits of dmo expeditionary advanced base operations and littoral operations in a contested environment manned and unmanned technology will be used to expand reach lethality and warfighter awareness 

the navy’s force structure goal of 355 ships identified in the december 2016 force structure assessment and codified in the fiscal year 2018 national defense authorization act has remained the fleet objective for five years the navy and the dod have been working to develop a successor for the 355ship forcelevel goal in december 2020 the outgoing administration released its vision for the navy’s future force structure in a fiscal year 2022 30year navy shipbuilding plan the plan envisioned achievement of the navy’s forcelevel goal through a distributed fleet architecture including 382 to 446 manned ships and 143 to 242 large unmanned vehicles by 2045 the new administration did not submit a new force structure goal or shipbuilding plan in 2021 but is expected to do so with the delivery of the fiscal year 2023 budget in spring 2022 

the defense department and navy not only face difficult tradeoffs between modernization priorities but also tradeoffs about where to take risk across time the shipbuilding defense industry is capital heavy and skilled labor intensive the navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by an increasingly fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers inconsistent shipbuilding plans and annual funding uncertainty severely degrade the ability of shipyards to conduct longterm planning and respond to nearterm changes in requirements this ultimately results in longer construction times and increased costs for example the high operational tempo of the navy in recent years has resulted in a backlog of repair work across the fleet coupled with the impacts of covid19 and increases in new ship construction many suppliers are experiencing a shortfall in their capacity to perform work and manufacture products this increased demand is applying stress to alreadyaging production equipment the combination of limited suppliers and an increase in workload could increase cost and potentially create schedule slips impacting american warfighting capability 

ultimately a balance will need to be achieved between the competing priorities of upgrading legacy systems for the nearterm developing and procuring the next generation of systems for the midterm and investing in emerging technologies that could drive gamechanging capabilities in the longterm additionally the us navy must compete with other budget priorities including other defense activities nondefense discretionary spending supplemental spending for covid19 relief and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding while the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense organizational costs including certain merger and acquisition costs and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to us government contracts 

our contracts typically fall into one of four categories firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and materials see note 7 revenue in item 8 

• firm fixedprice contracts  a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 

• fixedprice incentive contracts  fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit that affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

• costtype contracts  costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 

• time and materials  time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or overcost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria we consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our 

board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions we consider our policies relating to the following matters to involve our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

• revenue recognition 

• purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

• litigation commitments and contingencies 

• retirement related benefit plans and 

• workers compensation 

we have incorporated realized and estimated future effects of covid19 events based upon current conditions and our judgment of the future impacts of covid19 events with respect to contract costs and revenue recognition effective income tax rates and the fair values of our longlived assets financial instruments intangible assets and goodwill recorded at our reporting units see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the us government which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a costtocost measure of progress in estimating contract costs we utilize a profitbooking rate based upon performance expectations that takes into consideration a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements feasibility schedule and contract costs management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks which may increase the profitbooking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income see note 8 segment information in item 8 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

purchase accounting and goodwill  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values with the excess recorded as goodwill we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date the most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally related to customer contracts including backlog and recompeted contracts we determine the fair values of those customer related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates and discount rates 

goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we record a charge to operations 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

other intangible assets  we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or 

circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of the fair values of our business and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 

for further information on purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets see risk factors in item 1a and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies note 4 acquisitions and divestitures and note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets in item 8 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government audits inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental liability accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

income tax matters  the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim requires judgment we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position we recognize the amount of a tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 12 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

for further information on litigation commitments and contingencies see risk factors in item 1a and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies note 4 acquisitions and divestitures note 12 income taxes note 14 investigations claims and litigation and note 16 commitments and contingencies in item 8 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for 

these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income within segment operating income and nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

effective january 1 2021 we adopted the safe harbor methodology used in determining cas pension costs the interest rates used to calculate pension liabilities under cas are consistent with those used in the determination of minimum funding requirements under erisa 

pension funding requirements under erisa are subject to pension relief for plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions introduced by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act and subsequently extended by the american rescue plan act of 2021 using these minimum funding interest rates for the purposes of determining pension costs under cas reduces volatility in cas costs yearoveryear and provides more predictable costs for our customers while better aligning reimbursements of pension costs under our contracts with our required pension plan contributions under erisa 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and generally not changed during the following year unless a major plan event occurs such as an amendment curtailment or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which plan benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of highquality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the rate of return assumption is based more on longterm prospective 

views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 

mortality  mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2021 the actual return on assets was approximately 127 which was more than the expected return assumption of 725 for the year ended december 31 2021 the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 20 and 19 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in actuarial gains of 412 million and 289 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pension expense and obligations 

assuming a 725 expected return on assets assumption a 50 million pension plan contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

other fas and cas pension considerations  a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants under cas harmonization the amortization period is 10 years for actuarial gains and losses both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome 

securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds private partnerships collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair values of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent 

for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive loss  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2021 and 2020 were 1194 million and 2007 million respectively the decrease in actuarial losses in 2021 was primarily driven by asset returns exceeding expected returns by 412 million lower benefit obligations of 289 million resulting from higher discount rates and 107 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2021 and 2020 were 60 million and 85 million respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the change in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2021 resulted from plan amendments and the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis for further information on workers’ compensation see environmental health  safety in item 1 and note 16 commitments and contingencies in item 8

consolidated operating results 

the following table presents selected financial highlights 

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 

2021  product sales in 2021 increased 150 million or 2 from 2020 product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 105 million in 2021 primarily as a result of lower volumes in the legend class nsc program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in surface combatants newport news product sales

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 

cost of product sales 

2021  cost of product sales in 2021 increased 337 million or 6 compared to 2020 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 82 million in 2021 primarily as a result of volume decreases described above cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 65 million in 2021 primarily as a result of submarine volume increases described above partially offset by impacts related to performance on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events in 2020 cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 20 million in 2021 primarily due to the higher volumes described above cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 334 million from 2020 to 2021 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from 821 in 2020 to 851 in 2021 primarily due to an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment lower risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by impacts related to performance on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events in 2020 higher risk retirement on bougainville lha 8 and a contract incentive on jack h lucas ddg 125 

2020  cost of product sales in 2020 increased 463 million or 9 compared to 2019 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 22 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 480 million in 2020 primarily as a result of program cost growth and the volume increases described above cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 65 million in 2020 primarily due to the higher volumes described above cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 104 million from 2019 to 2020 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased from 823 in 2019 to 821 in 2020 primarily due to a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment and higher risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 uss tripoli lha 7 and richard m mccool jr lpd 29 as well as yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 of 111 million on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including 95 million for cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends as well as 16 million from delay and disruption directly attributable to covid19 events the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was also offset by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 aggregating 61 million across all programs resulting from cost estimates for delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events including 16 million in relation to the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program discussed above 

cost of service revenues 

2021  cost of service revenues in 2021 increased 128 million or 6 compared to 2020 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 46 million in 2021 primarily as a result of lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment decreased 74 million in 2021 primarily as a result of lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 177 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher volumes described above cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 71 million from 2020 to 2021 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from 824 in 2020 to 871 in 2021 primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment lower risk retirement on submarine support services and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2020  cost of service revenues in 2020 decreased 140 million or 6 compared to 2019 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 10 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by recovery of losses on a longterm design contract in 2019 cost of service revenues at our newport news segment decreased 12 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by lower risk retirement on naval nuclear support services cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased 98 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 20 million from 2019 to 2020 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased from 839 in 2019 to 824 in 2020 primarily driven by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by lower risk retirement on naval nuclear support services 

income from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2021  income from operating investments net increased 9 million or 28 to 41 million in 2021 from 32 million in 2020 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture and nuclear and environmental joint ventures 

2020  income from operating investments net increased 10 million or 45 to 32 million in 2020 from 22 million in 2019 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and msts investments 

other income and gains net 

2021  other income and gains net in 2021 were flat compared to 2020 

2020  other income and gains net in 2020 were flat compared to 2019 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2021  general and administrative expenses in 2021 decreased 6 million or 1 compared to 2020 this decrease was primarily driven by favorable changes in current state income tax expense partially offset by unfavorable changes in noncurrent state income tax expense and higher overhead costs driven by the acquisition of alion 

2020  general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased 116 million or 15 compared to 2019 this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of hydroid and higher overhead costs and current state income tax expense partially offset by favorable changes in noncurrent state income tax expense 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for 

goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and consistent with industry practice we define operating income as revenues less the related costs of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income 

   

segment operating income 

2021  segment operating income in 2021 was 683 million compared to 555 million in 2020 the increase was driven by impacts related to performance on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events in 2020 

2020  segment operating income in 2020 was 555 million compared to 631 million in 2019 the decrease was driven by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 totaling 167 million from updated cost and schedule assumptions across all programs 

included in the 167 million of unfavorable adjustments was 111 million related to block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program for unfavorable cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends our risk retirement assumptions on block iv boats anticipated boattoboat cost and schedule improvements working down the learning curve but performance trends exacerbated by covid19 events made those improvements less likely to occur also included in the 167 million of unfavorable adjustments was 61 million for the margin impact of delay and disruption cost estimates across all programs from discrete covid19 events including 16 million relating to block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program which was included in the 111 million unfavorable adjustments noted above these unfavorable margin adjustments were partially offset by higher risk retirement on uss delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive higher risk retirement and improved performance on uss tripoli lha 7 and richard m mccool jr lpd 29 and a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment and operating fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with gaap and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with cas the operating fascas adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

effective january 1 2021 we adopted the safe harbor methodology for determining cas pension costs under the new methodology the interest rates used to calculate pension liabilities under cas are consistent with those used in the determination of minimum funding requirements under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa 

the components of the operating fascas adjustment were as follows 

2021  the operating fascas adjustment in 2021 was a net expense of 157 million compared to a net benefit of 248 million in 2020 the unfavorable change was primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas 

2020  the operating fascas adjustment in 2020 was a net benefit of 248 million compared to a net benefit of 124 million in 2019 the favorable change was primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of lower interest rates under cas 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2022 to be a net benefit of approximately 152 million 105 million fas and 47 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of the 2021 asset returns under fas 

we expect the operating fascas adjustment in 2022 to be a net expense of approximately 142 million 189 million fas and 47 million cas the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2022 when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state unrecognized tax benefits in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2021  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2021 was 13 million compared to 4 million in 2020 the unfavorable change in noncurrent state income taxes was driven by an increase in deferred state income tax expense primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses not currently deductible for income tax purposes 

2020  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2020 was 4 million compared to 19 million in 2019 the decrease in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by a decrease in deferred state income tax expense the decrease in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and pension related adjustments 

interest expense 

2021  interest expense in 2021 was 89 million compared to 114 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily a result of costs associated with the early redemption in 2020 of 600 million aggregate principal amount of our 5000 senior notes due in 2025 partially offset by increased borrowing to fund the acquisition of alion with the issuance of 400 million aggregate principal amount of 0670 senior notes due 2023 600 million aggregate principal amount of 2043 senior notes due 2028 and a 650 million threeyear term loan 

2020  interest expense in 2020 was 114 million compared to 70 million in 2019 the increase was primarily a result of costs associated with the early redemption of 600 million aggregate principal amount of our 5000 senior notes due 2025 and the issuance in 2020 of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3844 senior notes due 2025 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4200 senior notes due 2030 partially offset by reduced borrowing on our credit facilities 

nonoperating retirement benefit 

the nonoperating retirement benefit includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

2021  a favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit of 62 million from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher 2020 returns on plan assets 

2020  a favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit of 107 million from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by higher 2019 returns on plan assets 

other net 

2021  other net income in 2021 was 17 million compared to 6 million in 2020 the increase was primarily driven by an impairment of a loan receivable in 2020 

2020  other net income in 2020 was consistent with 2019 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2021  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 125 in 2021 compared to 141 in 2020 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development tax credits for prior periods and a tax loss associated with the sale of our oil and gas business partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 

2020  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 141 in 2020 compared to 196 in 2019 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2020 was primarily attributable to favorable adjustments related to research and development tax credits for prior tax years 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and technical solutions 

the following table presents segment operating results 

key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance such as the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to estimated costs at completion eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

cumulative adjustments 

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 

for the year ended december 31 2021 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments included risk retirement on bougainville lha 8 a contract incentive on jack h lucas ddg 125 and risk retirement on fort lauderdale lpd 28 during the same period no unfavorable cumulative catchup margin adjustments were individually significant 

for the year ended december 31 2020 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments included risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive naval nuclear support services the san antonio class lpd 17 program and other individually insignificant adjustments 

during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily driven by 111 million in the second quarter of 2020 on the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including 95 million for cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends our risk retirement assumptions on block iv boats anticipated boattoboat cost and schedule improvements working down the learning curve but performance trends exacerbated by the covid19 events made those improvements less likely to occur unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments on the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program also included 16 million from delay and disruption directly attributable to covid19 events due to lower employee attendance decreased availability of critical skills and outofsequence work unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments across all programs resulting from delay and disruption cost estimates for discrete covid19 events were 61 million including 16 million in relation to the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program discussed above 

for the year ended december 31 2019 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to contract changes on submarine support services risk retirement on the legend class nsc program surface combatants and the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included recognition of a forward loss on a fleet support services contract and schedule delays on uss tripoli lha 7 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned on a performance obligation related to a complex constructiontype contract we recognize the entire loss on the performance obligation in the period the loss is determined 

ingalls

newport news 

sales and service revenues 

2021  newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased 92 million or 2 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by higher revenues in submarines and aircraft carriers partially offset by lower revenues in naval nuclear support services submarine revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on block v boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and the columbia class ssbn 826 submarine program partially offset by lower volumes on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program aircraft 

carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the rcoh of uss john c stennis cvn 74 the construction of enterprise cvn 80 and the construction of doris miller cvn 81 partially offset by lower volumes on the construction of john f kennedy cvn 79 and the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 naval nuclear support service revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in submarine fleet support services and facility maintenance services partially offset by higher volumes in carrier fleet support services

segment operating income 

2021  newport news segment operating income in 2021 was 352 million compared to segment operating income of 233 million in 2020 the increase was primarily due to impacts related to performance on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events in 2020 

2020  newport news segment operating income in 2020 was 233 million compared to segment operating income of 410 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program for the reasons described above in segment operating results  cumulative adjustments” and 2019 contract changes on submarine support services 

technical solutions 



sales and service revenues 

2021  technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 208 million or 16 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher volumes in dfs from the acquisition of alion partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and contribution of our san diego shipyard to a joint venture 

2020  technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 31 million or 3 compared to 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of hydroid in 2020 partially offset by lower volume at our san diego shipyard following the conclusion of several repair contracts 

segment operating income 

2021  technical solutions segment operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 was 50 million compared to operating segment operating income of 41 million in 2020 the increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of alion and equity income from nuclear and environmental joint ventures partially offset by lower performance in unmanned systems and the amortization of alion purchased intangible assets 

2020  technical solutions segment operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 was 41 million compared to a segment operating loss of 14 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to a goodwill 

impairment at our oil and gas reporting unit and a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 as well as higher equity income from our nuclear and environmental joint ventures and improved performance on dfs services 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2021 was approximately 485 billion total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

we expect approximately 19 of the 485 billion total backlog as of december 31 2021 to be converted into sales in 2022 us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

awards 

2021  the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31 2021 was approximately 81 billion comprised primarily of awards for the rcoh of uss john c stennis cvn 74 construction of a 10th boat of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and construction of john f lehma n ddg 137 

2020  the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31 2020 was approximately 89 billion comprised primarily of construction contracts for pittsburgh lpd 31 module sections for each of the first two columbia class ssbn 826 submarines sam nunn ddg 133 and thad cochran ddg 135 

liquidity and capital resources 

we seek to efficiently convert operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 

  

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

cash flows 

we discuss below our significant operating investing and financing activities affecting cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2021  cash provided by operating activities was 760 million in 2021 compared to 1093 million in 2020 the unfavorable change of 333 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to changes in trade working capital partially offset by lower income tax payments and lower contributions to retiree benefit plans the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable and receipts of accounts receivable 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2022 in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing borrowing facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and fund capital expenditures for at least the next 12 calendar months beginning january 1 2022 and beyond such 12month period based on our current business plans 

2020  cash provided by operating activities was 1093 million in 2020 compared to 896 million in 2019 the favorable change of 197 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to changes in trade working capital partially offset by higher contributions to retiree benefit plans higher income tax payments and higher interest payments the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by deferred payroll tax payments under the cares act as well as the timing of receipts of accounts receivable and payments of accounts payable 

investing activities 

2021  cash used in investing activities was 1954 million in 2021 an increase of 1195 million from 2020 the change in investing cash flow was primarily driven by the acquisitions of alion and a noncontrolling interest in a specialty fabrication and ship repair joint venture in 2021 partially offset by the acquisition of hydroid in 2020 and lower capital expenditures and the disposition of our oil and gas business in 2021 

for 2022 we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 10 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 15 to 20 of annual revenues 

2020  cash used in investing activities was 759 million in 2020 an increase of 132 million from 2019 the change in investing cash flow was driven by business acquisitions including hydroid partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2020 and the acquisition of fulcrum in 2019 

financing activities 

2021  cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was 1309 million compared to 103 million provided by financing activities in 2020 the change in financing cash was primarily due to an increase of 1225 million in net proceeds from longterm debt a decrease of 15 million in premiums related to the 2020 early extinguishment of debt and a decrease of 6 million in employee taxes on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by an increase of 17 million in common stock repurchases an increase of 14 million in cash dividend payments and an increase of 9 million in debt issuance costs 

2020  cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was 103 million compared to 434 million used in financing activities in 2019 the change in financing cash was primarily due to 1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes a decrease of 178 million from common stock repurchases and a decrease of 10 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by a 600 million increase in repayment of longterm debt a 23 million increase in cash dividend payments an increase of 15 million in premiums related to early extinguishment of debt and an increase of 13 million in debt issuance costs 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net earnings as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 

2021  free cash flow decreased 308 million from 2020 primarily due to changes in trade working capital partially offset by lower income tax payments lower contributions to retiree benefit plans and lower capital expenditures 

2020  free cash flow increased 297 million from 2019 primarily due to a change in trade working capital and lower capital expenditures partially offset by higher contributions to retiree benefit plans and higher income tax payments 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the funded status of the plans we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 60 million 205 million and 21 million in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our qualified pension plans were funded 102 and 91 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2021 and 2020 these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations we expect our 2022 cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be less than 1 million all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries under our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit plan contributions were 37 million 33 million and 31 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect 2022 contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 34 million which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries under our contracts contributions for other postretirement benefit plans are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis 

other sources and uses of capital 

stockholder distributions  in november 2021 our board of directors authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to  118 per share the board previously increased the quarterly cash dividend to  114 per share in november 2020 and  103 per share in november 2019 we paid cash dividends totaling  186 million 460 per share  172 million 423 per share and  149 million 361 per share in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

additional capital  i n 2021 we issued  400 million aggregate principal amount of callable unregistered 0670  senior notes due 2023 and  600 million aggregate principal amount of unregistered 2043  senior notes due 2028 both with registration rights the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of alion interest on these senior notes is payable semiannually 

in 2021 we amended and restated our existing  125 billion credit facility increasing the capacity thereunder to  15 billion and extending the maturity date to five years from signing the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of  300 million the revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based upon our credit rating which may vary between 1125  and 2000  as of december 31 2021 the interest rate spread on drawn amounts was 1375  based on our current credit rating the revolving credit facility also has a commitment fee rate on the unutilized balance based on our credit ratings the commitment fee rate as of december 31 2021 was 0200  and may vary between 0125  and 0300

customers 

our revenues are primarily derived from the us government including the us navy the us coast guard the dod the doe and other federal agencies in 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 88 87 and 88 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy 

intellectual property 

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration processes in addition to owning intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties the us government receives nonexclusive licenses to our intellectual property developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize other parties to use the intellectual property we license to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other 

intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our total backlog was approximately 460 billion and 465 billion respectively we expect approximately 17 of backlog at december 31 2020 to be converted into sales in 2021 

raw materials 

the most significant material we use is steel other materials we use in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government for longterm contracts we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

governmental regulation and supervision 

we operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts as well as legal and regulatory requirements affecting cyber security environmental protection and our nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks see risk factors in item 1a 

we are overseen and audited by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems government property management systems estimating systems earned value management systems and material management accounting systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems although this has not materially impacted the timing of our cash receipts in the past any such action by the us government in the future could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the remaining profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a 

termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if we cannot reach agreement with the us government 

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires bidders to submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins to enable the navy to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder us government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government and certain costs are not allowable and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

our business including contracts with us government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the federal acquisition regulation far the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act us cost accounting standards cas the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment we are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations which increase compliance risks and costs and may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to substantial fines and other penalties 

environmental compliance 

our manufacturing operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2020 our probable estimable future costs for environmental remediation were immaterial in addition we cannot reasonably estimate remediation costs at certain of our potential environmental remediation sites although information gained as remediation progresses may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations we do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the us nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and the doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and in the case of certain shipbuilding programs smaller shipyards the smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors intense competition related to programs resources funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

while we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to longterm teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both virginia class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines and columbia class ssbn 826 ballistic missile submarines we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at costs consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government and energy markets 

human capital resources 

hii recognizes that our employees are our most important assets and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives our employees are critical to driving operational execution meeting customer expectations providing strong financial performance advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success 

we have approximately 42000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 6700 engineers and designers and approximately 2800 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1500 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2020 we had 1281 master shipbuilders at newport news and 226 at ingalls we also employ more than 6500 veterans across the enterprise 

in addition over 1100 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding divisions from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives we employ approximately 4400 apprentice school alumni comprised of 3100 at newport news and 1350 at ingalls 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in november 2021 december 2022 and april 2024the collective bargaining agreement that expires in november 2021 covers approximately 50 of newport news employees newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 25 technical solutions employees at various locations are represented by unions and perform work under collective bargaining agreements 

we have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 21 years at nns and more than 13 years at ingalls we are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory 

the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and develop a skilled and diverse workforce of talented and highperforming employees at all levels of our organization to succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor we have developed key workforce development recruitment and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business these strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs policies and initiatives 

competitive pay and benefits  our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract retain and motivate employees to achieve our objectives 

• we provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions skill levels experience knowledge and geographic location 

• we utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry 

• the structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both shortterm and longterm performance and we align our executive longterm equity compensation metrics with longterm shareholder interests 

• employees are eligible for health insurance paid and unpaid leaves 401k plans and life and disabilityaccident insurance coverage we also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs including annual leavepaid time off paid holidays flexible work arrangementsschedules telemedicine parental leave transgender medical coverage and a wellness program that includes physical mental and financial wellness components we also fund the operation of family health centers near our two shipyards which provide a full range of medical lab pharmacy dental physical therapy and vision services 

recruitment training and workforce development  our three segments hire thousands of employees each year in 2020 we hired more than 6000 new employees to help us meet this large demand for talent we have worked to create develop and maintain multiple talent pipelines one of the key components of our approach to workforce development is to “grow our own” we operate two apprentice schools one at ingalls and one at newport news the newport news apprentice school was founded in 1919 and the ingalls apprentice school was founded in 1952 

the two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 14000 graduates since their inceptions the schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our crafttrades and technical workforces as well as developing the future leaders of our company the ingalls apprentice school has partnered with the mississippi gulf coast community college to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate’s degree the newport news apprentice school has partnered with two community colleges as well as old dominion university to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering electrical engineering or modeling  simulation 

in addition to operating our own apprentice schools we have developed and nurtured multiple partnerships with state and local governments prek education providers primarysecondary school districts community colleges and fouryear colleges and universities as well as postgraduate institutions we also make significant investments through monetary contributions leadership time and employee volunteer hours to support these critical partnerships 

we maintain effective partnerships with colleges and universities military bases for transitioning veterans and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering it and other technical talent working closely with state and local government leaders we have successfully facilitated local regional and statewide workforce development and education initiatives that include prek programs high school trades programstalent development labs prehire tradestechnical community college programs internscoops with colleges and universities adult trades programs veterans and military spouses training programs and unemployedunderemployed training programs 

we view our workforce development process as a “leadership factory” and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks since our founding in 2011 we have followed our succession plans 80 of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position and we have filled 75 of newly created vice president positions with internal hires 

environmental health  safety “ehs”  the health safety and wellbeing of our employees together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise we prioritize manage and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental safety and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at doe sites on which technical solutions segment employees work 

safety goals are included in operational metrics for purposes of the newport news and ingalls compensation programs we also use a wide variety of training courses prejob “take five” crew talks medical surveillance programs and employee involvement efforts to keep our workforce focused on ehs at newport news and ingalls a key component of our ehs program is the utilization of health and safety teams which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and frontline managers whose goal is to educate engage and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury illness and environmental impacts we employ programs focused on identifying reporting and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize evaluate and control hazards 

during 2020 we tracked several metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance one of the key metrics is total case rate “tcr” which is the number of occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injuries per 100 equivalent employees the tcr for newport news was 477 in 2020 compared to 467 in 2019 and the tcr at ingalls was 635 in 2020 compared to 659 in 2019 newport news also tracks days away restricted or transferred “dart” which is the number of osha recordable cases in which the employee is unable to work cannot work due to a restriction or can work with a restriction as a result of an injury per 100 equivalent employees dart at newport news was 341 in 2020 compared to 301 in 2019 ingalls tracks two other safety metrics lost time case rate “ltcr” which is the number of employees that lost work time per 100 employees and lost work day rate “lwdr” which is the number of lost workdays per 

100 fulltime employees the ltcr and lwdr at ingalls were 253 and 5637 respectively in 2020 and 239 and 5682 respectively in 2019 

we also track the number of implemented safety improvements year over year we implemented over 2300 safety improvements in 2020 compared to more than 1800 in 2019 

in connection with the outbreak of covid19 the dod designated newport news and ingalls as critical infrastructure industry our production and support workforce therefore continued inperson work at our facilities to provide vital products and services to our government customers while many of our employees in support and administrative functions have effectively worked remotely since midmarch 2020 prior to the covid19 pandemic less than 400 of our employees regularly worked remotely and at our peak more than 11300 employees were working remotely 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we implemented changes in march 2020 to protect our employees and customers and support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we began temperature screening and onsite testing for covid19 for employees entering our shipyards implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for our shops ships and offices reengineered how some work was performed in order to support social distancing requirements and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for employees in our support and administrative functions 

corporate values  we operate on a set of values that are shared with all employees integrity safety respect engagement responsibility and performance always doing the right thing is an essential belief at hii that tone starts at the top and permeates through the culture of the company it is a set of core values standards and behaviors that guide employee commitment to the highest ethical standards and serves as the underlying framework for all of our human capital strategies 

advancing and celebrating diversity and inclusion “di”  we believe we gain a key competitive advantage by building a workforce community that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds skills and experiences regardless of race ethnicity color religion sex disability nationality or other differentiation and our leaders leverage the differences within their teams we also believe di is vital to our ability to grow and innovate in an everchanging fastpaced environment our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas which we believe enables better business decisions the following are highlights of our di program 

• employee resource groups “ergs” are a key component of our corporate culture and an important part of our diversity and inclusion strategy we currently sponsor 15 erg’s which are employeeled and open to all employees including african american shipbuilders association asian  pacific islander shipbuilding association generational integration focus team hispanic outreach  leadership alliance women in shipbuilding enterprise ingalls shipbuilders equality alliance shipbuilders together realizing inclusion diversity and equality and the veterans employee resource group 

• we have established di councils at our corporate office and at each of our three segments which provide strategic direction guidance and advocacy for our di initiatives and advancements these councils are led by senior executives and include highperforming employees and leaders from across our enterprise 

• we have a long history of participation in a number of annual national diversity conferences including black engineer of the year awards society of hispanic engineers and professionals society of asian scientists and engineers society of women engineers great minds in stem hispanic engineers national achievement award conference women of color stem conference and the national society of black engineers convention these events provide recruitment recognition and development opportunities for our diverse workforce 

employee engagement  since 2006 we have conducted an annual anonymous engagement survey of our workforce both nonrepresented and represented administered and analyzed by an independent thirdparty the survey results are reviewed by our executive team and other senior leaders at our three segments the results of this engagement survey are also shared with individual managers and employees who are then tasked with discussing the results with their teams and working together to set goals and implement actions to improve employee engagement and performance over 79 of our workforce participated in the 2020 engagement survey we believe that at the individual employee level engagement is about taking ownership of your work and work processes at the enterprise level engagement is about creating an inclusive and highly collaborative culture where we all care about and encourage each other’s success and supporting the opportunity to create more value and transform our business for the future

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

industry and economic risk factors 

we depend on the us government for substantially all of our business and risks that arise from conducting business with the us government could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships and nonnuclear ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy we also provide fleet sustainment services to the us navy it and missionbased solutions for the dod and intelligence and federal civilian customers and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the doe and dod substantially all of our revenues in 2020 were derived from products and services sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition substantially all of our backlog as of december 31 2020 was us government related our us government contracts are subject to various risks including customer political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customer short term and long term strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain legal or regulatory violations any of these factors could affect our business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional funding of us navy us coast guard and other government agency programs  the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years as a result a program may be funded initially on a partial basis and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may not recover those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual contracts or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plans it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels including defense spending will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by shifts in customer priorities resulting from changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for less expensive alternatives and the increasing proliferation of advanced weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2020 our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes to customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for the us governments convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

our industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from greater focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of defense funds to key areas for future defense spending these initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way us government contracts are solicited negotiated and managed which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the us government including the terms and conditions under which we do so which may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award fee criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that mandate what our costs should be may affect our profitability and predictability of our profit rates the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor 

in addition to the dods business practice initiatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize cost recoverysavings as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits moreover the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs or the allowability of certain costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict a longer term reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 296 ships as of december 31 2020 has resulted in workforce reductions but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards five major private united states shipyards two of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for contracts to build surface combatants  submarines and large deck amphibious ships and smaller shipyards have entered the market for surface combatants we may compete in the future with the same contractor and other shipyards to build new and different classes of ships as well as ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard became capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which can reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

changes in estimates used in contract accounting could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgments relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed which subjects our risk assessments revenue and cost estimates and assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our judgment  estimation  and assumption processes are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can result if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2020 we had 17 billion of debt under our senior notes and 17 billion of additional borrowing capacity under our primary credit agreement and 364day credit agreement the “credit facilities” our credit facilities also allow us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing capacity in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1 billion and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt the amount of our existing debt combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

• requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industries in which we operate 

• exposing us to the risk of higher interest rates on borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program which are subject to variable rates of interest 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds 

the interest rate on variable rate indebtedness under our credit facilities is based upon the london interbank offered rate “libor” libor has been the subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified after 2021 we cannot predict the consequences of the discontinuance of the libor benchmark but any successor benchmark rate to libor could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

business and operational risk factors 

cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that does not result in higher contract value due from customers reduces our profit and exposes us to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate estimates used for the initial calculation of contract costs reasons may include labor unavailability or reduced productivity the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover costs and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends upon the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and material contracts under firm fixed price contracts we agree to perform the specified work for a predetermined price to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss some firm fixedprice contracts have a performancebased component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based upon our performance fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract subject to a costshare limit that impacts the profit on the contract costtype contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded under time and material contracts we are paid for direct labor hours incurred at specified hourly rates plus material costs see the contract section under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 for descriptions of the types of contracts that comprise our business 

approximately 55 of our revenues in 2020 were generated under fixed price incentive contracts approximately 38 were generated under costtype contracts approximately 4 were generated under time and material contracts and approximately 3 were generated under firm fixedprice contracts our failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs our operating results could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customers cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform our contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the timing of product deliveries and other matters we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections contract performance schedule delays and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials  major components and subsystems  hardware elements  and subassemblies for our products and to perform certain services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or misalignments between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to satisfy our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our 

suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide agreedupon products or materials or perform agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or they otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to meet expectations could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental support to our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts including as a result of increases in material costs although we may be protected from increases in material costs through contract cost escalation provisions the difference in basis between our actual material costs and industry indices may expose us to cost recovery risk in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part on a timely compliant and costeffective basis could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to provide quality materials and services to support our programs and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and the expectations set forth in the hii supplier code of conduct in connection with the materials and services we procure in some circumstances we rely on representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also conduct technical assessments inspections and audits as necessary with subcontractors and suppliers notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving materials and services that fail to meet specifications or requirements subcontractors and suppliers sometimes provide us with unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services 

our inability to procure or a significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations inaccurate certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance or noncompliant materials components or parts from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts in turn our performance depends upon our ability to develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and other employees with the necessary skills and security clearances at the same time future revenues and costs impact our ability to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear related skills and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could experience difficulties performing our contracts and competing for new contract awards 

many of our contracts include performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities or stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include new technologies or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet performance expectations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services that often involve innovative designs new technologies and complex manufacturing processes problems and delays with product development technology implementation manufacturing or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technologies supplied by the us navy or other contractors or developed by us problems developing or implementing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design and construction schedule the risks associated with new technologies or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery delays in receipt of necessary customer information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which can adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of elements that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unexpected degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or customer indemnification diversion of management attention to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts reimbursement to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to determine the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets which to a large extent are reflective of the financial markets and economic conditions changes to these estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets could significantly impact our retirement related expense the funded status of benefit plans and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans which could have material adverse effects on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally pension cost recoveries under cas for our us government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or the periods in which we make contributions to our benefit plans and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries 

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations which can adversely affect our contract performance and as a result our financial results environmental disasters 

particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water we use for transporting and testing our ships can cause schedule delays under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security issues such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks which may have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of covid19 such risks include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work or work effectively as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers we have experienced higher employee absentee rates as a result of covid19 which has impacted our operations and financial results higher absentee rates attributable to covid19 including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions resulting from covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact performance on our contracts and have increased and may continue to increase our costs these impacts may continue and the cost increases may not be fully recoverable under our contracts or adequately covered by insurance which could impact our profitability for example after our reinsurers failed to acknowledge coverage for various losses related to covid19 we filed a complaint in state court in vermont seeking a judgment declaring that our business interruption and other losses associated with covid19 are covered by our property insurance program although we believe that our position is wellfounded no assurance can be provided regarding the ultimate resolution of this matter see note 15 investigations claims and litigation 

covid19 has also further caused disruption in our supply chain caused delays in and limited the ability of the us government and other customers to perform including in making timely decisions on contract awards impacted investment performance and caused other unpredictable events some or all of these impacts might continue into the future in addition covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital 

covid19 has impacted our business and results of operations and the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations and financial condition in the future is uncertain and will depend upon future developments as a result we cannot predict the full impact of covid19 but it could materially affect our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows in the future 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in november 2021 december 2022 and april 2024 the collective bargaining agreement that expires in november 2021 covers approximately 50 of newport news employees newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 25 technical solutions employees at various locations are represented by unions and perform work under collective bargaining agreements 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have experienced in the past work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

we could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols and implement security controls and complementary cyber security technologies in compliance with industry requirements we face substantial cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information from advanced nation state threat actors sophisticated cybercrime syndicates hacktivists and insiders while we implement countermeasures to address the risks posed by these threats external and internal threat actors continuously seek to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure assets and data 

our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners also face cyber security and other security threats although we undertake cooperative efforts with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to assist them with understanding the threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to defend against potential cyberattacks other security threats and business disruptions we rely substantially on the safeguards implemented by these organizations which may affect the security of our information these organizations have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions involve estimates assumptions and judgments to determine acquisition prices which are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our acquisition and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from expectations in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses 

as of december 31 2020 goodwill and purchased intangible assets from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 20 and 6 respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such developments that result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to award administration and performance of us government contracts as well as legal and regulatory requirements affecting cyber security environmental protection and our nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and risks and change on a routine basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in further performance and compliance requirements and higher costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we are overseen and audited by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause significant reputational damage 

the us   government also has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems which can have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed which sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the dfars the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cas if a determination is made that we engaged in illegal activities or we are not presently responsible as defined under the far we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs and may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging in accordance with applicable permits to manage these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of above ground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we anticipate incurring future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment moreover if we violate the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental matters our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we have been impacted in the past by the misconduct of employees and business partners and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors moreover the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand our operations into foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage 

our nuclear operations subject us to environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

• potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials including nuclear assemblies and their components 

• unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance operations security and repairs including repairs required by the us navy the nuclear regulatory commission or the doe 

• reputational damage 

• potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control and 

• regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations 

failure to properly store handle and dispose of nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of remedial actions taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could require substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring future material cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax proceedings compliance proceedings customer claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary sanctions government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property the us government is taking increasingly aggressive positions both as to the intellectual property to which they believe government use rights apply and to the acquisition of broad license rights if the us government is successful in these efforts our intellectual property on which we depend to compete and our access to and use of certain supplier intellectual property could be negatively affected 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however adequately protect the trade secrets on which we depend to compete 

our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could reduce our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy as a result our navy contracts include provisions regarding notice and approval rights for the navy in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders 

general risk factors 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to insure our significant risks and potential liabilities that are insurable including among others property loss from natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in 

some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage we can reasonably purchase may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business can make it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact and loss resulting from such events limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us incurring substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases for which we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors 

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and as a result our ability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in us incurring significant incremental costs and delays 

strategic acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties 

as part of our business strategy we identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and investments when evaluating such transactions we make significant judgments regarding the values of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of strategic acquisitions acquisitions and investments also involve other risks and uncertainties including the integration of acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges unexpected liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and impairment charges on goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

there can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels 

the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors considered in the context of then current conditions including our earnings other operating results and capital requirements declines in asset values or increases in liabilities including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes can reduce stockholders’ equity a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future in addition the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors including our share price results of operations capital requirements and general business conditions as well as applicable law

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

covid19 pandemic  the covid19 global pandemic has had wide ranging effects on the global health environment and disrupted the global and us economies and financial markets including impacts to our employees customers suppliers and communities collectively “covid19 events” covid19 events are also impacting our operations and the continuing impacts are uncertain the most significant elements of uncertainty have been the intensity and duration of the impact on our employees’ ability to work effectively disruption in our supply chain disruption of the us governments and our other customers abilities to perform their obligations and impact on pension assets and other investment performance 

we are aggressively managing our response to the uncertainties regarding covid19 events our primary focus has been to minimize the risk to our employees by updating leave policies increasing telecommuting and making benefits changes to provide employees maximum flexibility we have also adjusted policies and workspaces to align with centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” guidelines and to support social distancing including increased sanitation efforts personal protective equipment for employees and suspension of all nonessential work travel as a result we have incurred and expect to continue incurring costs related to covid19 events including paid leave quarantining employees and recurring facility cleaning while our shipyards and other facilities remain open and productive we experienced temporary decreases in workforce attendance which impacted our operations due to delay and disruption from the lack of availability of critical skills and outofsequence work as of december 31 2020 workforce attendance has returned to standard rates 

under section 3610 of the cares act contractors may submit claims for employee paid time off caused by restrictions from covid19 events in circumstances where the employee could not work remotely such instances may include paid time off for employees to allow for plant decontamination idle time due to social distancing restrictions paid time off to take care of dependents impacted by government ordered school or day care closures and employee quarantines due to travel restrictions or coming into contact being diagnosed or taking care of someone diagnosed with covid19 we have taken steps to preserve our rights to pursue such claims for ourselves and our subcontractors 

while costs related to covid19 events are allowable under us government contracts our contract estimates reflect margin impact uncertainty because such costs may not result in equitable adjustments particularly on firm fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts or may not be adequately covered by insurance our reinsurers have failed to acknowledge coverage for various losses related to covid19 and we filed a complaint in state court in vermont seeking a judgment declaring that our business interruption and other losses associated with covid19 are covered by our property insurance program although we believe that our position is wellfounded no assurance 

can be provided regarding the ultimate resolution of this matter see note 15 investigations claims and litigation in item 8 

we also have no assurance that congress will appropriate sufficient funds to cover the reimbursement of costs contemplated by the cares act for the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized across all of our programs an aggregate unfavorable impact on operating margin of 61 million for delay and disruption cost estimates directly attributable to covid19 events we also are deferring certain payroll taxes pursuant to the cares act which has the effect of increasing our cash from operations in 2020 but reducing cash from operations in 2021 and 2022 

we have also focused on actively supporting our customers suppliers and communities we have been proactive in engaging with our us government customers regarding future contract adjustments while there has been no change in contract terms or substantial degradation in timely payments from customers we have experienced delays in decisions on certain contract awards we are unable to predict how our customers will allocate resources in the future as they react to the evolving demands of the covid19 response we have accelerated payments to small business suppliers in an effort to minimize supply chain disruption to complement these efforts we took actions to enhance liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet by issuing 1 billion in new senior notes and entering into an incremental 500 million revolving credit facility while we decided to temporarily halt stock repurchases during this time of uncertainty we view share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to resume share repurchases once we see sustained normalization of activity related to covid19 

while there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of covid19 events going forward our crisis management team meets regularly to assess the covid19 environment and prioritizes our flexibility to respond to new developments our employees suppliers customers and communities have faced significant challenges and we cannot predict how the covid19 environment will continue to evolve or the full impact it will have for further information on the potential impact of covid19 events to the company see item 1a “risk factors” 

us government contracts  longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure 

the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle ultimately concluded with the passage and enactment of defense authorization and defense appropriations measures both pieces of legislation broadly supported shipbuilding programs including funding and authority for an additional virginia class submarine the bundled purchase of lha 9 unnamed with lpd 32 unnamed and lpd 33 unnamed and longlead material for an additional arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyer the final bills also continued support of the dual purchase of enterprise cvn 80 and doris miller cvn 81 as well as the refueling and complex overhaul of uss john c stennis cvn 74 

longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the 2018 national defense strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the reemergence of longterm strategic competition 

between nations america also faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield combined across domains and conducted at increasing speed and reach the security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war the drive to develop new capabilities and enhance lethality is relentless expanding to address emerging threats from peercompetitors as well as actors with lower barriers of entry and moving at accelerating speed new capabilities and lethality enhancements include unmanned and autonomous systems and platforms hypersonics directed energy resilient networks command control communications computers cyber intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and targeting c5isrt requirements and fleet design 

we expect that execution of the dod strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in enhancing the readiness of the current force with investments in new capabilities force constructs technologies and capacity to meet future challenges the dod also faces the additional challenges of recapitalizing aging infrastructure including the naval shipyards and transforming manpower personnel training and education to recruit and retain an empowered force other budget priorities could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

we also anticipate that the us navys warfighting strategy will continue to emphasize sea control and sea denial that enables power projection against adversaries with longrange weapons and fullspectrum joint domain capabilities additionally the navy will likely continue to employ the evolving concept of distributed maritime operations dmo which features multiple sensors and shooters that are widely dispersed across a broad range of manned and unmanned platforms and linked through resilient networks for the united states marine corps usmc the commandants guidance returns the corps to its maritime roots by evolving from a force requirement of 38 large amphibious warships in support of “20” marine expeditionary brigades to a force trained and equipped as a naval expeditionary forceinreadiness and prepared to operate inside actively contested maritime spaces in support of fleet operations in addition to employment of assets such as lhas lpds and dock landing ships lsd the usmc’s anticipated force may also feature an expanded assortment of smaller platforms landing craft and connectors that are manned minimallymanned and unmanned and exploit autonomy and artificial intelligence 

in december 2019 the chief of naval operations released fragmentary order 012019 a design for maintaining maritime superiority the order was written to simplify prioritize and build upon the foundation of “design 20” released in 2018 and focus the us navy’s efforts on warfighting warfighters and the future navy the endstate for the “warfighting” tenet is a us navy that is ready to win across the full range of military operations in competition crisis and contingency by persistently operating forward with agility and flexibility in an alldomain battlespace the endstate for the “warfighters” tenet is a worldclass naval force through recruitment education training and retention of talented americans – a force that empowers us navy families the endstate for the “future navy” tenet envisions a fleet designed to ensure the wholeness of combat capability and lethal forces maximizing the benefits of dmo expeditionary advanced base operations and littoral operations in a contested environment manned and unmanned technology will be used to expand reach lethality and warfighter awareness 

while the force objective of 355 ships has been memorialized as national policy by the 2018 ships act both the congressional research service and congressional budget office have estimated that additional ships would need to be added to the us navy’s 30year plan to achieve an objective of 355 ships or greater unless the navy extends the service lives of existing ships and reactivates recently retired ships 

in december 2020 the outgoing administration released its vision for the navy’s future force structure in a fiscal year 2022 30year navy shipbuilding plan the plan envisions achievement of the navy’s forcelevel goal through a distributed fleet architecture including 382 to 446 manned ships and 143 to 242 large unmanned vehicles by 2045 the incoming administration can choose to adopt revise or set aside this plan and is required by law to submit a fiscal year 2022 30year fiscal year 2022fiscal year 2051 navy shipbuilding plan in conjunction with its proposed fiscal year 2022 defense budget although the executive branch is required by law to submit a 30year shipbuilding plan each year in conjunction with its annual budget submission previous administrations have sometimes chosen not to submit a 30year shipbuilding plans during their first year in office in order to spend that year reviewing and revising the defense strategy plans and programs upon which future 30year shipbuilding plans will be based 

in january 2021 the chief of naval operations released his 2021 navigation plan which echoes the themes of the fiscal year 2022 shipbuilding plan and details how the navy will focus on improving its readiness capability and capacity in the next decade to maintain its advantage at sea in particular the plan calls for the us to modernize 

the fleet and take advantage of emerging technologies the plan also states the navy needs to improve planning maintenance availabilities improve operational level maintenance practices and provide predictable requirements to industry additionally the plan anticipates that the navy will have to divest from some programs to build naval power in other areas this includes planned divestment of some legacy platforms and transfer of noncore missions to other military services 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by an increasingly fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys littoral combat ship and the market for the future frigate program 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control additionally the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities nondefense discretionary spending supplemental spending for covid19 relief and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding while the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our contracts typically fall into one of four categories firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and materials see note 7 revenue in item 8 

• firm fixedprice contracts  a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 

• fixedprice incentive contracts  fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit that affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

• costtype contracts  costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 

• time and materials  time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative 

penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria we consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider our policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

• revenue recognition 

• purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

• litigation commitments and contingencies 

• retirement related benefit plans and 

• workers compensation 

we have incorporated realized and estimated future effects of covid19 events based upon current conditions and our judgment of the future impacts of covid19 events with respect to contract costs and revenue recognition effective income tax rates and the fair values of our longlived assets financial instruments intangible assets and goodwill recorded at our reporting units see note 2 basis of presentation in item 8 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the us government which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a costtocost measure of progress the use of the costtocost method to measure performance progress over time is supported by clauses in the related contracts that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process 

when the customer is not a us government entity we may recognize revenue over time or at a point in time when control transfers upon delivery depending upon the facts and circumstances of the related arrangement when we determine that revenue should be recognized over time we utilize a measure of progress that best depicts the transfer of control of the relevant goods and services to the customer generally the terms and conditions of the contracts result in a transfer of control over the related goods and services as we satisfy our performance obligations accordingly we recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method to measure performance progress we may however utilize a measure of progress other than costtocost such as a laborbased measure of progress if the terms and conditions of the arrangement require such accounting 

when using the costtocost method to measure performance progress certain contracts may include costs that are not representative of performance progress such as large upfront purchases of uninstalled materials unexpected waste or inefficiencies in these cases we adjust our measure of progress to exclude such costs with the goal of better reflecting the transfer of control over the related goods or services to the customer and recognizing revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred that reflect our performance under the contract 

in addition for time and material arrangements we often utilize the practical expedient allowing the recognition of 

revenue in the amount we invoice which corresponds with the value provided to the customer and to which we are entitled to payment for performance to date 

a performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for which revenue is recognized to determine the proper revenue recognition method consideration is given to whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one contract and whether a single contract consists of more than one performance obligation for contracts with multiple performance obligations the contract transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price based upon expected cost plus a margin at contract inception which is generally the price disclosed in the contract contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements in the majority of circumstances modifications do not result in additional performance obligations that are distinct from the existing performance obligations in the contract and the effects of the modifications are recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catchup basis alternatively in instances in which the performance obligations in the modifications are deemed distinct contract modifications are accounted for prospectively 

the amount of revenue recognized as we satisfy performance obligations associated with contracts with customers is based upon the determination of transaction price transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled for performance under the terms and conditions of the relevant contract and may reflect fixed and variable components including shareline incentive fees whereby the value of the contract is variable based upon the amount of costs incurred as well as other incentive fees based upon achievement of contractual schedule commitments or other specified criteria in the contract shareline incentive fees are determined based upon the formula under the relevant contract using our estimated cost to complete for each period we generally utilize a most likely amount approach to estimate variable consideration in all such instances the estimated revenues represent those amounts for which we believe a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

contract estimates  in estimating contract costs we utilize a profitbooking rate based upon performance expectations that takes into consideration a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements feasibility schedule and contract costs management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks which may increase the profitbooking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks conversely if we are not able to retire these risks cost estimates may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

the cost estimation process requires significant judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any performance delays the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 

changes in estimates of sales costs and profits on a performance obligation are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2020 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments included risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive naval nuclear support services the san antonio class lpd 17 program and other individually insignificant adjustments 

during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily driven by 111 million in the second quarter of 2020 on the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including 95 million for cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends our risk retirement assumptions on block iv boats anticipated boattoboat cost and schedule improvements working down the learning curve but performance trends exacerbated by the covid19 events made those improvements less likely to occur unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments on the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program also included 16 million from delay and disruption directly attributable to covid19 events due to lower employee attendance decreased availability of critical skills and outofsequence work unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments across all programs resulting from delay and disruption cost estimates for discrete covid19 events were 61 million including 16 million in relation to the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program discussed above 

for the year ended december 31 2019 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to contract changes on submarine support services risk retirement on the legend class nsc program surface combatants and the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included recognition of a forward loss on a fleet support services contract and schedule delays on uss tripoli lha 7 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended december 31 2018 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend class nsc program uss portland lpd 27 and fort lauderdale lpd 28 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including lower performance on delaware ssn 791 and montana ssn 794 and other individually insignificant adjustments 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned on a performance obligation related to a complex constructiontype contract we recognize a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation in the period the loss is determined 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2020 and 2019 was 1617 million and 1373 million respectively 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we record a charge to operations 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2020 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our three reporting units with goodwill balances as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we estimated that the fair value of the government services reporting unit within the technical solutions segment exceeded carrying value by less than 10 we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units exceeded by more than 10 their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2020 

november 30 2019 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the 

estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2019 except for the oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment 

our determination of fair value as of november 30 2019 of our oil and gas reporting unit considered the slower than expected growth in operating margin a revised longterm outlook for the reporting unit and less favorable market conditions the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of november 30 2019 and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 29 million at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 

november 30 2018 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2018 

other intangible assets  we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or 

circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government examinations inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental liability accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of each of december 31 2020 and 2019 were immaterial see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2020 due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of facilities currently in use may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of a tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income within segment operating income and nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

effective january 1 2021 we adopted the safe harbor methodology used in determining cas pension costs under the new methodology the interest rates used to calculate pension liabilities under cas are consistent with those used in the determination of minimum funding requirements under erisa 

this change in cas methodology is not expected to have a material effect on our minimum pension funding requirements and no effect on benefits received by participants of the pension plans while cas costs under the new methodology are generally expected to be comparable over the life of a plan on a net present value basis the change is expected to decrease cas costs due to the higher interest rates applicable with funding relief thus resulting in a lower fascas adjustment based on current interest rate conditions we also expect that pension 

contributions will decrease in substantially the same amount as cas costs with limited impact to cash flows and consolidated segment operating income 

pension funding requirements under erisa are subject to pension relief for plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions introduced by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act and subsequently extended by the highway and transportation funding act in 2014 and the bipartisan budget act of 2015 using these minimum funding interest rates for the purposes of determining pension costs under cas reduces volatility in cas costs yearoveryear and provides more predictable costs for our customers while better aligning reimbursements of pension costs under our contracts with our required pension plan contributions under erisa 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and generally not changed during the following year unless a major plan event occurs such as an amendment curtailment or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which plan benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pension plans was 280 and 339 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 275 and 335 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the rate of return assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 725 expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2020 pension expense and we anticipate retaining that assumption throughout 2021 

mortality  mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2020 the actual return on assets was approximately 15 which was more than the expected return assumption of 725 for the year ended december 31 2020 the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 59 and 60 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in 

an actuarial gain of 541 million and an actuarial loss of 780 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pension expense and obligations 



assuming a 725 expected return on assets assumption a 50 million pension plan contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

under the us cost accounting standards boards final cas harmonization rule harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds since harmonization became fully phased in during 2017 the greater of the two liabilities is used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality corporate bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization 

other fas and cas pension considerations  a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants under cas harmonization the amortization period is 10 years for actuarial gains and losses both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustments in 2020 2019 and 2018 were net benefits of 367 million 136 million and 364 million respectively the favorable change from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by more immediate recognition of the 2019 asset gains under fas and the impacts of lower discount and interest rates the unfavorable change from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by more immediate recognition of the 2018 asset losses under fas and the impacts of higher discount and interest rates our projected 2021 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate 

investment funds private partnerships collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent 

for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive loss  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2020 and 2019 were 2007 million and 1855 million respectively the increase in actuarial losses in 2020 was primarily driven by a 780 million actuarial loss due to the decrease in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and 102 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses partially offset by actual asset returns which were 541 million above expected returns 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2020 and 2019 were 85 million and 50 million respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the change in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2020 resulted from plan amendments and the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 092 and 192 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase in the discount rate would decrease the discounted workers compensation benefit and assessment obligation by approximately 66 million decreasing the discount rate by 100 basis points to 000 while not allowing the interest rate to be negative increases the discounted workers compensation benefit and assessment obligation by approximately 76 million the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 752 million and 802 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

consolidated operating results 

the following table presents selected financial highlights 



operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 



2020  product sales in 2020 increased 585 million or 9 from 2019 product sales at our ingalls segment increased 143 million in 2020 primarily as a result of higher volumes in amphibious assault ships and surface combatants partially offset by lower volume in the legend class nsc program newport news product sales 

increased 366 million in 2020 primarily as a result of higher volumes in aircraft carriers and submarines partially offset by lower volume on commercial nuclear products technical solutions product sales increased 76 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the acquisition of hydroid inc hydroid in march 2020 

service revenues in 2020 decreased 123 million or 5 from 2019 service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 21 million in 2020 as a result of lower volumes in amphibious assault ship services service revenues at our newport news segment decreased 30 million in 2020 primarily as a result of lower volumes in aircraft carrier services partially offset by higher volumes in naval nuclear support and submarine services service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased 72 million in 2020 primarily as a result of lower volumes at our san diego shipyard and on dfs oil and gas and nuclear and environmental services partially offset by the acquisition of hydroid in march 2020

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales 

2020  cost of product sales in 2020 increased 463 million or 9 compared to 2019 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 22 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 480 million in 2020 primarily as a result of program cost growth and the volume increases described above cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 65 million in 2020 primarily due to the higher volumes described above cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 104 million from 2019 to 2020 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined from 823 in 2019 to 821 in 2020 primarily due to a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment and higher risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 

119 uss tripoli lha 7 and richard m mccool jr lpd 29 as well as yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 of 111 million on block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including 95 million for cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends as well as 16 million from delay and disruption directly attributable to covid19 events the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was also offset by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 aggregating 61 million across all programs resulting from cost estimates for delay and disruption from discrete covid19 events including 16 million in relation to the block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program discussed above 

2019  cost of product sales in 2019 increased 531 million or 11 compared to 2018 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 54 million in 2019 primarily as a result of lower risk retirement in amphibious assault ships partially offset by the lower volumes described above as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 349 million in 2019 primarily as a result of volume changes described above partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 3 million in 2019 primarily due to the lower volumes described above cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 131 million from 2018 to 2019 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from 768 in 2018 to 823 in 2019 primarily 

due to an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a workers compensation benefit in 2018 lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program and uss tripoli lha 7 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by higher risk retirement on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act 

cost of service revenues 

2020  cost of service revenues in 2020 decreased 140 million or 6 compared to 2019 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 10 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by recovery of losses on a longterm design contract in 2019 cost of service revenues at our newport news segment decreased 12 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by lower risk retirement on naval nuclear support services cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased 98 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 20 million from 2019 to 2020 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased from 839 in 2019 to 824 in 2020 primarily driven by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by lower risk retirement on naval nuclear support services 

2019  cost of service revenues in 2019 increased 452 million or 26 compared to 2018 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 2 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by the recognition in 2018 of a loss on a longterm design contract and improved performance on surface combatant services cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 68 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 347 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above and a loss on a fleet support services contract partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 35 million from 2018 to 2019 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from 817 in 2018 to 839 in 2019 primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a loss on a fleet support services contract and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by contract changes on submarine support services one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act and the recognition in 2018 of a loss on a longterm design contract 

income from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2020  income from operating investments net increased 10 million or 45 to 32 million in 2020 from 22 million in 2019 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and msts investments 

2019  income from operating investments net increased 5 million or 29 to 22 million in 2019 from 17 million in 2018 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and n3b investments 

other income and gains 

2020  other income and gains in 2020 were consistent with 2019 

2019  other income and gains decreased 14 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment in 2018 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2020  general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased 116 million or 15 compared to 2019 this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of hydroid and higher overhead costs and current state income tax expense partially offset by favorable changes in noncurrent state income tax expense 

2019  general and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased 83 million or 10 compared to 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by lower overhead costs and current state income tax expense partially offset by the addition of fulcrum and g2 and unfavorable changes in noncurrent state income tax expense 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for 

goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2019  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in 2019 of  29 million at our technical solutions segment see note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets in item 8 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and consistent with industry practice we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income 



segment operating income 

2020  segment operating income in 2020 was 555 million compared to 631 million in 2019 the decrease was driven by unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in the second quarter of 2020 totaling 167 million from updated cost and schedule assumptions across all programs 

included in the 167 million of unfavorable adjustments was 111 million related to block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program for unfavorable cost and schedule performance and updates to our assumptions for future program efficiencies and performance as a result of cost and schedule trends our risk retirement assumptions on block iv boats anticipated boattoboat cost and schedule improvements working down the learning curve but performance trends exacerbated by covid19 events made those improvements less likely to occur also included in the 167 million of unfavorable adjustments was 61 million for the margin impact of delay and disruption cost estimates across all programs from discrete covid19 events including 16 million relating to block iv boats of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program which was included in the 111 million unfavorable adjustments noted above these unfavorable margin adjustments were partially offset by higher risk retirement on delbert d black ddg 119 in connection with its delivery and a capital expenditure contract incentive higher risk retirement and improved performance on uss tripoli lha 7 and richard m mccool jr lpd 29 and a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 

2019  segment operating income in 2019 was 631 million compared to 663 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to favorable changes in workers compensation expense in 2018 a goodwill impairment at our technical solutions segment lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program and uss tripoli lha 7 a loss on a fleet support services contract and recoveries related to a 2018 settlement agreement at our ingalls segment partially offset by contract changes on submarine support services higher volume at our newport news segment higher risk retirement on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment and operating fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with gaap and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with cas the operating fascas adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

the components of the operating fascas adjustment were as follows 



2020  the operating fascas adjustment in 2020 was a net benefit of 248 million compared to a net benefit of 124 million in 2019 the favorable change was primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of lower interest rates under cas 

2019  the operating fascas adjustment in 2019 was a net benefit of 124 million compared to a net benefit of 290 million in 2018 the unfavorable change was primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2021 to be a net benefit of approximately 18 million 28 million fas and 46 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of the 2020 asset returns under fas and the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas 

we expect the operating fascas adjustment in 2021 to be a net expense of approximately 163 million 209 million fas and 46 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2021 when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state unrecognized tax benefits in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2020  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2020 was 4 million compared to 19 million in 2019 the decrease in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by a decrease in deferred state income tax expense the decrease in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and pension related adjustments 

2019  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2019 was 19 million compared to 2 million in 2018 the increase in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by an increase in deferred state income tax expense and state unrecognized tax benefits the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments 

interest expense 

2020  interest expense in 2020 was 114 million compared to 70 million in 2019 the increase was primarily a result of costs associated with the early redemption of 600 million aggregate principal amount of our 5000 senior notes due 2025 and the issuance in 2020 of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3844 senior notes due 2025 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4200 senior notes due 2030 partially offset by reduced borrowing on the credit facilities 

2019  interest expense in 2019 was 70 million compared to 58 million in 2018 the increase was primarily a result of an increase in short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program in 2019 

nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the nonoperating retirement benefit expense includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

2020  a favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense of 107 million from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by higher 2019 returns on plan assets 

2019  an unfavorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense of 62 million from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by lower 2018 returns on plan assets 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2020  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 141 in 2020 compared to 196 in 2019 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2020 was primarily attributable to favorable adjustments related to research and development tax credits for prior tax years 

2019  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 196 in 2019 compared to 139 in 2018 the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 was primarily attributable to claims for higher research and development tax credits for prior tax years recorded in 2018 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and technical solutions 

the following table presents segment operating results 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance such as the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among 

other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

sales and service revenues

2019  technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 331 million or 37 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher dfs revenues attributable to the additions of fulcrum and g2 as well as higher oil and gas revenues 

segment operating income 

2020  operating income in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2020 was 41 million compared to an operating loss of 14 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to a goodwill impairment at our oil and gas reporting unit and a loss on a fleet support services contract in 2019 as well as higher equity income from our nuclear and environmental joint ventures and improved performance on dfs services

liquidity and capital resources 

we seek to efficiently convert operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2020  cash provided by operating activities was 1093 million in 2020 compared to 896 million in 2019 the favorable change of 197 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to changes in trade working capital partially offset by higher contributions to retiree benefit plans higher income tax payments and higher interest payments the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by deferred payroll tax payments under the cares act as well as the timing of receipts of accounts receivable and payments of accounts payable 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2021 in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2019  cash provided by operating activities was 896 million in 2019 compared to 914 million in 2018 the decrease of 18 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to a change in trade working capital partially offset by decreased funding of retiree benefit plans the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

investing activities 

2020  cash used in investing activities was 759 million in 2020 an increase of 132 million from 2019 the change in investing cash flow was driven by business acquisitions including hydroid partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2020 and the acquisition of fulcrum in 2019 

for 2021 we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 10 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 20 to 30 of annual revenues 

2019  cash used in investing activities was 627 million in 2019 an increase of 151 million from 2018 the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of fulcrum and higher capital expenditures partially offset by the acquisition of g2 inc in 2018 and investments in nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2018 

financing activities 

2020  cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was 103 million compared to 434 million used in 2019 the change in financing cash was primarily due to 1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes a decrease of 178 million from common stock repurchases and a decrease of 10 million in employee taxes on certain sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by a 600 million increase in repayment of longterm debt a 23 million increase in cash dividend payments an increase of 15 million in premiums related to early extinguishment of debt and an increase of 13 million in debt issuance costs 

2019  cash used in financing activities in 2019 was 434 million compared to 899 million used in 2018 the change was primarily due to decreases of 480 million of common stock repurchases and 2 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by an increase of 17 million of cash dividend payments 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2020  free cash flow increased 297 million from 2019 primarily due to changes in trade working capital and lower capital expenditures partially offset by higher contributions to retiree benefit plans and higher income tax payments 

2019  free cash flow decreased 52 million from 2018 primarily due to a change in trade working capital and higher capital expenditures partially offset by decreased funding of retiree benefit plans 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the funded status of the plans we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 205 million 21 million and 508 million in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our qualified pension plans were funded 91 and 89 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2020 and 2019 these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations we expect our 2021 cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 60 million all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries under our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit plan contributions were 33 million 31 million and 30 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect 2021 contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 33 million which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries under our contracts contributions for other postretirement benefit plans are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis

national security cutters 

the us coast guards recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline the flagship of this program is the legend class nsc a multimission platform we designed and continue to build we delivered uscgc kimball nsc 7 and uscgc midgett nsc 8 to the us coast guard in 2018 and 2019 respectively stone nsc 9 is currently under construction and scheduled for delivery in 2020 in 2018 we were awarded longleadtime material and construction contracts for calhoun nsc 10 and nsc 11 unnamed which are currently under construction 

newport news 

the core business of our newport news segment is designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships our newport news shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

design construction refueling and complex overhaul and inactivation of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers cvn are core to newport news operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has designed and built more than 30 aircraft carriers for the us navy since 1933 including all ten nimitz class cvn 68 aircraft carriers currently in active service as well as the first ship of the next generation gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier uss gerald r ford cvn 78 in 2017 beginning in 2009 we received contract awards totaling 76 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier john f kennedy cvn 79 in addition we have received awards valued at 152 billion for detail design and construction of the gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers enterprise cvn 80 and doris miller cvn 81 

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes nearly four years to complete with the work accounting for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and fleet support across the globe 

in 2017 we completed the rcoh for uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 and redelivered the ship to the us navy we are currently performing the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our rcoh performance on the first six nimitz class cvn 68 carriers our highly trained workforce the capitalintensive nature of rcoh work and high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for rcoh contract awards on the remaining nimitz class cvn 68 carriers as well as future work on gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

we received a contract in 2013 to inactivate the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 inactivation was completed in the second quarter of 2018 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten nimitz class cvn 68 carriers we delivered that are currently in active service as well as gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers we will deliver in the future present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans we believe we are well positioned as the us navys shipyard of choice for these contract awards

corporate 

hii was incorporated in delaware on august 4 2010 and became an independent publicly owned company in 2011 when we were spunoff from northrop grumman our principal executive offices are located at 4101 washington avenue newport news virginia 23607 our telephone number is 757 3802000 and our home page on the internet is wwwhuntingtoningallscom references to our website in this report are provided as a convenience and do not constitute and should not be viewed as incorporation by reference of the information contained on or available through the website accordingly such information should not be considered part of this report 

customers 

our revenues are primarily derived from the us government in 2019 2018 and 2017 approximately 87 88 and 87 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 4 5 and 6 respectively were generated from the us coast guard in 2019 2018 and 2017 we generated approximately 3 3 and 3 respectively of our revenues from commercial customers and 6 4 and 4 respectively from other government agencies 

intellectual property 

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration processes in addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government receives nonexclusive licenses to our intellectual property developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the intellectual property we license to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 our total backlog was approximately 465 billion and 230 billion respectively we expect approximately 17 of backlog at december 31 2019 to be converted into sales in 2020 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

the most significant material we use is steel other materials we use in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government for longterm contracts we generally obtain price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our 

business systems and processes relative to us government requirements our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems government property management systems estimating systems earned value management systems and material management accounting systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems although this has not materially impacted the timing of our cash receipts in the past any such action by the us government in the future could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the remaining profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those related to procurement and cyber security our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if we cannot reach agreement with the us government 

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires bidders to submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins to enable the navy to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder us government regulations determine the contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government and certain costs are not allowable and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

our business our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including the federal acquisition regulation far the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act us cost accounting standards cas the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act we are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

while we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to longterm teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both virginia class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines and columbia class ssbn 826 ballistic missile submarines we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at costs consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving 

multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2019 our probable estimable future costs for environmental remediation were immaterial in addition we cannot reasonably estimate remediation costs at certain of our potential environmental remediation sites although information gained as remediation progresses may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations we do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry includes exposure to hazardous materials and processes according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced three fatalities in the past eight years we strive to keep our occupational safety and health administration osha compliance programs strong 

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe each regulate and control various matters relating to our nuclear operations and nuclear materials subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 42000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 6800 engineers and designers and approximately 2500 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1380 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2019 we had 1057 master shipbuilders at newport news and 303 at ingalls we employ more than 7400 veterans across the enterprise 

more than 1900 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding segments each year in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives we employ approximately 4300 apprentice school alumni 2850 at newport news 1400 at ingalls and 50 at technical solutions

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

we depend heavily on the us government for substantially all of our business and risks that arise from conducting business with the us government could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships and nonnuclear ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy we also provide fleet sustainment services to the us navy it and missionbased solutions for the dod and intelligence and federal civilian customers and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the doe and dod substantially all of our revenues in 2019 were derived from products and services sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition substantially all of our backlog as of december 31 2019 was us government related our us government contracts are subject to various risks including customer political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customer short term and long term strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional funding of us navy us coast guard and other government agency programs  the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years as a result a program may be funded initially on a partial basis and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may not recover those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual contracts or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels including defense spending will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by shifts in customer priorities resulting from changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2019 our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes to customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based upon performance in the event of termination of a contract for the 

us governments convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program a termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that does not result in higher contract value due from customers reduces our profit and exposes us to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate estimates used for the initial calculation of contract costs reasons may include labor unavailability or reduced productivity the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover costs and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends upon the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and material contracts under firm fixed price contracts we agree to perform the specified work for a predetermined price to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss some firm fixedprice contracts have a performancebased component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based upon our performance fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract subject to a costshare limit that impacts the profit on the contract costtype contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded under time and material contracts we are paid for direct labor hours incurred at specified hourly rates plus material costs see the contract section under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 for descriptions of the types of contracts that comprise our business 

approximately 4 of our revenues in 2019 were generated under firm fixedprice contracts approximately 50 were generated under fixed price incentive contracts approximately 42 were generated under costtype contracts and approximately 4 were generated under time and material contracts our failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance under each type of contract if we are unable to control costs our operating results could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customers cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform our contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the timing of product deliveries and other matters we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections contract performance schedule delays and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials  major components and subsystems  hardware elements  and subassemblies for our products and to perform certain services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or misalignments between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to satisfy our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide agreedupon products or materials or perform agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or they otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to meet expectations could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental support to our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts including as a result of increases in material costs although we may be protected from increases in material costs through contract cost escalation provisions the difference in basis between our actual material costs and industry indices may expose us to cost recovery risk in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part on a timely compliant and costeffective basis could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to provide quality materials and services to support our programs and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and the expectations set forth in the hii supplier code of conduct in connection with the materials and services we procure in some circumstances we rely on representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also conduct technical assessments inspections and audits as necessary with subcontractors and suppliers notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving materials and services that fail to meet specifications or requirements subcontractors and suppliers sometimes provide us with unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services 

our inability to procure or a significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations inaccurate certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance or noncompliant materials components or parts from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

our industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from greater focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of defense funds to key areas for future defense spending these initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way us government contracts are solicited negotiated and managed which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the us government including the terms and conditions under which we do so which may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in procurement practices favoring incentivebased fee arrangements different award fee criteria nontraditional contract provisions and government contract negotiation offers that mandate what our costs should be may affect our profitability and predictability of our profit rates the us government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor 

in addition to dods business practice initiatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize cost recoverysavings as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits moreover the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and the allowability of other types of costs are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs or the allowability of certain costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts in turn our performance depends upon our ability to develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and other employees with the necessary skills and security clearances at the same time future revenues and costs impact our ability to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear related skills and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could experience difficulties performing our contracts and competing for new contract awards 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict a longer term reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 293 ships as of december 31 2019 has resulted in workforce reductions but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards five major private united states shipyards two of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for contracts to build surface combatants  submarines and large deck amphibious ships we may compete in the future with the same and other defense contractors to build new and different classes of ships as well as ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard became capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which can reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement cyber security and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and risks and change on a routine basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in further performance and compliance requirements and higher costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we are audited and reviewed on a regular basis by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause significant reputational damage 

the us   government also has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems which can have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed which sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far dfars the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cas if a determination is made that we engaged in illegal activities or we are not presently responsible as defined under the far we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs and may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities or stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include complex technologies or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet performance expectations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services utilized by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays with product development technology implementation or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technologies supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems developing or implementing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule for construction the risks associated with new technologies or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery untimely receipt of customer information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which can adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management attention to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts reimbursement to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to determine the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in estimates used in accounting for our contracts could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgments relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed which subjects our risk assessments revenue and cost estimates and assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our judgment  estimation  and assumption processes are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations which can adversely affect our contract performance and as a result our financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water we use for transporting and testing our ships can cause schedule delays under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security issues such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to buy insurance to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others property loss from natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage we can reasonably purchase may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact and any resulting loss of such events limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us incurring substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases for which we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and two site stabilization agreements newport news has four collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in november 2020 november 2021 december 2022 and april 2024 the collective bargaining agreement that expires in november 2021 covers approximately 50 of newport news employees 

newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 50 technical solutions employees at various locations are represented by unions and perform work under collective bargaining agreements 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have experienced in the past work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets which to a large extent are reflective of the financial markets and economic conditions changes to these estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets could significantly impact our retirement related expense the funded status of the plans and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans which could have material adverse effects on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally pension cost recoveries under cas for our us government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or the periods in which we make contributions to our plans and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries 

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to manage these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we anticipate future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment moreover if we violate the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental matters our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors 

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and as a result our ability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in us incurring significant incremental costs and delays 

  

our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we have been impacted in the past by the misconduct of employees and business partners and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors moreover the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand our operations into foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage 

we could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols and implement security controls and complementary cyber security technologies in compliance with industry requirements we face substantial cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information advanced nation state threat actors sophisticated cyber crime syndicates hacktivists and insiders can pose significant threats to our information technology infrastructure and assets while we implement countermeasures to address the risks posed by these threats external and internal threat actors continuously seek to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure assets and data 

our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners also face cyber security and other security threats although we undertake cooperative efforts with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to assist them with understanding the threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to defend against potential cyber attacks other security threats and business disruptions we rely substantially on the safeguards managed by these entities which may affect the security of our information these entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

our nuclear operations subject us to environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

• potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials including nuclear assemblies and their components 

• unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance operations security and repairs including repairs required by the us navy the nuclear regulatory commission or the doe 

• reputational damage 

• potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control and 

• regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of remedial actions taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions involve estimates assumptions and judgments to determine acquisition prices which are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from expectations in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses 

as of december 31 2019 goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 20 and 7 respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such developments that result in us recording additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business the ultimate taxability of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period 

changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences of opinions among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition to facilitate relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

as part of our business strategy we identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and investments when evaluating such transactions we make significant judgments regarding the values of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of business opportunities acquisitions and investments also involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges unexpected liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and impairment charges on goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring future material cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax proceedings compliance proceedings customer claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary sanctions government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property the us government is taking increasingly aggressive positions both as to the intellectual property to which they believe government use rights apply and to the acquisition of broad license rights if the us government is successful in these efforts our ability to compete and to obtain access to and use certain supplier intellectual property could be negatively affected 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets 

our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

there can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels 

the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors considered in the context of then current conditions including our earnings other operating results and capital requirements declines in asset values or increases in liabilities including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes can reduce stockholders’ equity a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future in addition the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors including our share price results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2019 we had 13 billion of debt under our senior notes and 12 billion of additional borrowing capacity under our credit agreement the “credit facility” our credit facility also allows us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing capacity in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1 billion and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt the amount of our existing debt combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

• requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industries in which we operate 

• exposing us to the risk of higher interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper program which are subject to variable rates of interest 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds 

the interest rate on variable rate indebtedness under our credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate “libor” libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 the consequences of the discontinuance of the libor benchmark cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could reduce our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy as a result our navy contracts include provisions regarding notice and approval rights for the navy in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment may have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

litigation  in march 2019 a new dry dock being transported for delivery to ingalls by a heavy lift ship struck an ingalls work barge which in turn was pushed into delbert d black ddg 119 causing damage to delbert d black ddg 119 the work barge and the new dry dock at the time of the incident responsibility for the new dry dock remained with the builder and the transport company repair work on delbert d black ddg 119 is in process at us navy direction we are working with the us navy to ascertain whether third parties will pay for the repairs to delbert d black ddg 119 or whether the repairs will be paid under the builders risk insurance included in the delbert d black ddg 119 contract claims were tendered to our insurers and we have received all outstanding claim proceeds in april 2019 we filed suit in the us district court for the southern district of mississippi seeking among other relief damages from negligent third parties based upon information currently available we believe we will collect sufficient funds from one or more third parties to compensate for the resulting direct and consequential damages but failure to collect sufficient funds or the length of time required to collect such funds could result in a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

longterm uncertainty exists with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure 

the national defense authorization act as well as appropriations measures that funded the dod doe and all other federal agencies was enacted in december 2019 for fiscal year 2020 while these measures largely supported our individual programs we cannot predict the potential impact should fiscal year 2020 appropriations be reprioritized or reprogrammed for other purposes by the executive branch longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured or maintained by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the 2018 national defense strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the reemergence of longterm strategic competition between nations america also faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield combined across domains and conducted at increasing speed and reach the security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war the drive to develop new capabilities and enhance lethality is 

relentless expanding to address emerging threats from peercompetitors as well as actors with lower barriers of entry and moving at accelerating speed new capabilities and lethality enhancements include unmanned and autonomous systems and platforms hypersonics directed energy resilient networks command control communications computers cyber intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and targeting c5isrt requirements and fleet design 

we expect that execution of the dod strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in enhancing the readiness of the current force with investments in new capabilities force constructs technologies and capacity to meet future challenges the dod also faces the additional challenges of recapitalizing aging infrastructure including the naval shipyards and transforming manpower personnel training and education to recruit and retain an empowered force other budget priorities could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in december 2016 the us navy released the findings of a yearlong force structure assessment developed to determine the right balance of existing forces the ships currently under construction and the future procurement plans needed to address the everevolving and increasingly complex threats that the navy is required to counter notably the force structure assessment did not present a desired force size the us navy would pursue if resources were not constrained it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success accordingly the force structure assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships comprised of 12 aircraft carriers 104 large surface combatants 52 small surface combatants 38 amphibious warfare ships 66 attack submarines 12 ballistic missile submarines 32 combat logistics ships 10 expeditionaryhigh speed transports 6 expeditionary support bases and 23 command and support ships additionally the 2018 national defense authorization act included the ships act which made it the policy of our nation to achieve a fleet size of 355 ships 

a new force structure assessment referred to as the integrated naval force structure assessment infsa is now underway and anticipated to be released in the spring of 2020 to influence the fiscal year 2022 budget request the us navy’s intent is for the infsa to reflect a shift in future warfighting by emphasizing sea control and sea denial that enables power projection against adversaries with longrange weapons and fullspectrum joint domain capabilities the infsa is also anticipated to implement the evolving concept of distributed maritime operations dmo which will feature multiple sensors and shooters that are widely dispersed across a broad range of manned and unmanned platforms and linked through resilient networks additionally the infsa will reflect the united states marine corpss usmc desire to return to its maritime roots by evolving from a force requirement of 38 large amphibious warships in support of “20” marine expeditionary brigades to a force trained and equipped as a naval expeditionary forceinreadiness and prepared to operate inside actively contested maritime spaces in support of fleet operations in addition to employment of assets such as lhas lpds and dock landing ships lsd the usmc’s force will likely feature an expanded assortment of smaller platforms landing craft and connectors that are manned minimallymanned and unmanned and exploit autonomy and artificial intelligence 

the us navy’s 2020 fiveyear shipbuilding plan included 55 new ships which is the same quantity that was included in the 2019 fiveyear shipbuilding plan but reflected an anticipated reduction in the quantity of amphibious warfare ships to offset a corresponding increase in the quantity of attack submarines and small surface combatants however the us navy’s 30year shipbuilding plan for 2020 reflects a total of 304 ships compared to the 2019 plan of 301 ships with respective increases of one each for attack submarines small surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships 

while the force objective of 355 ships reflected in the 2016 force structure assessment still pertains and has been memorialized as national policy by the 2018 ships act both the congressional research service and congressional budget office have estimated that additional ships would need to be added to the us navy’s 30year plan to achieve the 355 ship objective unless the navy extends the service lives of existing ships and reactivates recently retired ships 

in december 2018 the us navy also released its “design for maintaining maritime superiority version 20” design 20 which expands upon a posture initially put forth in january 2016 under version 10 of design 20 the new plan calls for four specific lines of effort strengthening naval power at and from the sea achieving highvelocity outcomes strengthening the us navy team of the future and expanding and strengthening the 

navy’s network of partners each line of effort calls for specific recommendations that are intended to make the us navy more agile more competitive and tougher as a means of strengthening naval power the plan expresses award date goals for several major programs including the future frigate and large surface combatant other initiatives include integrating more artificial intelligence and machine learning into warfare systems developing and fielding a family of directed energy weapons as well as employment of 3d printing for replacement parts 

in december 2019 the chief of naval operations released fragmentary order 012019 a design for maintaining maritime superiority the order was written to simplify prioritize and build upon the foundation of “design 20” and focus the us navy’s efforts on warfighting warfighters and the future navy the endstate for the “warfighting” tenet is a us navy that is ready to win across the full range of military operations in competition crisis and contingency by persistently operating forward with agility and flexibility in an alldomain battlespace the endstate for the “warfighters” tenet is a worldclass naval force through recruitment education training and retention of talented americans – a force that empowers us navy families the endstate for the “future navy” tenet envisions a fleet designed to ensure the wholeness of combat capability and lethal forces maximizing the benefits of dmo expeditionary advanced base operations and littoral operations in a contested environment manned and unmanned technology will be used to expand reach lethality and warfighter awareness 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by an increasingly fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys littoral combat ship and have expressed interest in the future frigate program 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control additionally the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities nondefense discretionary spending and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding while the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our contracts typically fall into one of four categories firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and materials see note 8 revenue in item 8 

• firm fixedprice contracts  a firm fixedprice contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 

• fixedprice incentive contracts  fixedprice incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs but are subject to a costshare limit that affects profitability fixedprice incentive contracts effectively become firm fixedprice contracts once the costshare limit is reached 

• costtype contracts  costtype contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit costtype contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 

• time and materials  time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria we consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider our policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

• revenue recognition 

• purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

• litigation commitments and contingencies 

• retirement related benefit plans and 

• workers compensation 

revenue recognition 

most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the us government which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a costtocost measure of progress the use of the costtocost method to measure performance progress over time is supported by clauses in the related contracts that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process 

when the customer is not a us government entity we may recognize revenue over time or at a point in time when control transfers upon delivery depending upon the facts and circumstances of the related arrangement when we determine that revenue should be recognized over time we utilize a measure of progress that best depicts the transfer of control of the relevant goods and services to the customer generally the terms and conditions of the contracts result in a transfer of control over the related goods and services as we satisfy our performance obligations accordingly we recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method to measure performance progress we may however utilize a measure of progress other than costtocost such as a labor 

based measure of progress if the terms and conditions of the arrangement require such accounting 

when using the costtocost method to measure performance progress certain contracts may include costs that are not representative of performance progress such as large upfront purchases of uninstalled materials unexpected waste or inefficiencies in these cases we adjust our measure of progress to exclude such costs with the goal of better reflecting the transfer of control over the related goods or services to the customer and recognizing revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred that reflect our performance under the contract 

in addition for time and material arrangements we often utilize the practical expedient allowing the recognition of revenue in the amount we invoice which corresponds with the value provided to the customer and to which we are entitled to payment for performance to date 

a performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for which revenue is recognized to determine the proper revenue recognition method consideration is given to whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one contract and whether a single contract consists of more than one performance obligation for contracts with multiple performance obligations the contract transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price based upon expected cost plus a margin at contract inception which is generally the price disclosed in the contract contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements in the majority of circumstances modifications do not result in additional performance obligations that are distinct from the existing performance obligations in the contract and the effects of the modifications are recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catchup basis alternatively in instances in which the performance obligations in the modifications are deemed distinct contract modifications are accounted for prospectively 

the amount of revenue recognized as we satisfy performance obligations associated with contracts with customers is based upon the determination of transaction price transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled for performance under the terms and conditions of the relevant contract and may reflect fixed and variable components including shareline incentive fees whereby the value of the contract is variable based upon the amount of costs incurred as well as other incentive fees based upon achievement of contractual schedule commitments or other specified criteria in the contract shareline incentive fees are determined based upon the formula under the relevant contract using our estimated cost to complete for each period we generally utilize a most likely amount approach to estimate variable consideration in all such instances the estimated revenues represent those amounts for which we believe a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

contract estimates  in estimating contract costs we utilize a profitbooking rate based upon performance expectations that takes into consideration a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements feasibility schedule and contract costs management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks which may increase the profitbooking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks conversely if we are not able to retire these risks cost estimates may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

the cost estimation process requires significant judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any performance delays the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 

changes in estimates of sales costs and profits on a performance obligation are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods 

for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2019 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to contract changes on submarine support services risk retirement on the legend class nsc program surface combatants and the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included recognition of a forward loss on a fleet support services contract and schedule delays on tripoli lha 7 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended december 31 2018 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend class nsc program uss portland lpd 27 and fort lauderdale lpd 28 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including lower performance on delaware ssn 791 and montana ssn 794 and other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended december 31 2017 favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the legend class nsc program tripoli lha 7 uss portland lpd 27 and the delivered uss john finn ddg 113 the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 and other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned on a performance obligation related to a complex constructiontype contract we recognize a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation in the period the loss is determined 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1373 million and 1263 million respectively 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we record a charge to operations 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2019 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2019 except for the oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment 

our determination of fair value as of november 30 2019 of our oil and gas reporting unit considered the slower than expected growth in operating margin a revised longterm outlook for the reporting unit and less favorable market conditions the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of november 30 2019 and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 29 million at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 

november 30 2018 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2018 

november 30 2017 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2017 

other intangible assets  we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or 

circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government examinations inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental liability accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of each of december 31 2019 and 2018 were immaterial see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2019 due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of facilities currently in use may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through 

normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of a tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 14 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 19 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income within segment operating income and nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

we use a current market rate to determine the cas interest rate effective january 1 2021 we will adopt the safe harbor methodology used in determining cas pension costs under the new methodology the interest rates used to calculate pension liabilities under cas are consistent with those used in the determination of minimum funding requirements under erisa 

pension funding requirements under erisa are subject to potential pension relief for plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions introduced by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act and subsequently extended by the highway and transportation funding act in 2014 and the bipartisan budget act of 2015 using these minimum funding interest rates for the purposes of determining pension costs under cas reduces volatility in cas costs yearoveryear and provides more predictable costs for our customers while better aligning reimbursements of pension costs under our contracts with our required pension plan contributions under erisa 

this change in cas methodology is not expected to have a material effect on our minimum pension funding requirements and no effect on benefits received by participants of the pension plans while cas costs under the new methodology are generally expected to be comparable over the life of a plan on a net present value basis the change is expected to decrease cas costs following adoption in 2021 due to the higher interest rates applicable with funding relief thus resulting in a lower fascas adjustment following adoption in 2021 and based on current interest rate conditions we also expect that pension contributions will decrease in substantially the same amount as cas costs with limited impact to cash flows and consolidated segment operating income 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event such as an amendment curtailment or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 339 and 434 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 335 and 433 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 725 expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2019 pension expense and we anticipate retaining that assumption throughout 2020 

mortality  mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive 

loss this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2019 the actual return on assets was approximately 22 which was more than the expected return assumption of 725 for the year ended december 31 2019 the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 95 and 98 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial gain of 825 million and an actuarial loss of 1039 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



assuming a 725 expected return on assets assumption a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond yields or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under the us cost accounting standards boards final cas harmonization rule harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds since harmonization became fully phased in during 2017 the greater of the two liabilities is used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality corporate bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization prior to the full phasing in of harmonization the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities was required 

other fas and cas pension considerations  a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants under cas harmonization the amortization period is 10 years for actuarial gains and losses both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustments in 2019 2018 and 2017 were net benefits of 136 million 364 million and 189 million respectively the unfavorable change from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by more immediate 

recognition of the 2018 asset losses under fas and the impacts of higher discount and interest rates the favorable change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by more immediate recognition of the 2017 asset gains under fas and the impacts of lower discount and interest rates and other experience gains and losses and assumptions changes eg mortality our projected 2020 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds private partnerships collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 19 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive loss  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 19 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2019 and 2018 were 1855 million and 1692 million respectively the increase in these actuarial losses in 2019 was primarily driven by a 1039 million actuarial loss due to the decrease in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations 102 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses and actual asset returns which were 825 million above expected returns 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2019 and 2018 were 50 million and 46 million respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the change in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2019 resulted from the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 192 and 289 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 44 million or 53 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 802 million and 845 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

consolidated operating results 

the following table presents selected financial highlights 



operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 



2019  product sales in 2019 increased 242 million or 4 from 2018 product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 71 million in 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes in the legend class nsc program amphibious assault ships and surface combatants newport news product sales increased 346 million in 2019 primarily as a 

result of higher volumes in aircraft carriers and submarines technical solutions product sales decreased 33 million in 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes in nuclear and environmental products 

service revenues in 2019 increased 481 million or 22 from 2018 service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 18 million in 2019 as a result of higher volumes in amphibious assault ship services partially offset by lower volume in surface combatant services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 118 million in 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes in aircraft carrier and naval nuclear support services partially offset by lower volume in submarine services service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 345 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the addition of fulcrum and g2 as well as higher volumes in fleet support oil and gas and other mdis services

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales 

2019  cost of product sales in 2019 increased 531 million or 11 compared to 2018 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 54 million in 2019 primarily as a result of lower risk retirement in amphibious assault ships partially offset by the lower volumes described above as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 383 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 37 million in 2019 primarily due to the lower volumes described above cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 131 million from 2018 to 2019 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from 768 in 2018 to 823 in 2019 primarily due to an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a workers compensation benefit in 2018 lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program and tripoli lha 7 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by higher risk retirement on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act 

2018  cost of product sales in 2018 increased 350 million or 8 compared to 2017 cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 171 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above lower risk retirement on tripoli lha 7 and the legend class nsc program and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 264 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 23 million in 2018 primarily due to the lower volumes described above and an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 62 million from 2017 to 2018 

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from 767 in 2017 to 768 in 2018 primarily 

due to lower risk retirement on tripoli lha 7 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and the legend class nsc program as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act offset by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

cost of service revenues 

2019  cost of service revenues in 2019 increased 452 million or 26 compared to 2018 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 2 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by the recognition in 2018 of a loss on a longterm design contract and improved performance on surface combatant services cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 67 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 348 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above and a loss on a fleet support services contract partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment increased 35 million from 2018 to 2019 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from 817 in 2018 to 839 in 2019 primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the operating fascas adjustment a loss on a fleet support services contract and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by contract changes on submarine support services one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act and the recognition in 2018 of a loss on a longterm design contract 

2018  cost of service revenues in 2018 increased 222 million or 14 compared to 2017 cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 3 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 244 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 4 million in 2018 primarily due to one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 23 million from 2017 to 2018 

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased from 822 in 2017 to 817 in 2018 primarily driven by the resolution in 2017 of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act partially offset by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2019  income from operating investments net increased 5 million or 29 to 22 million in 2019 from 17 million in 2018 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and n3b investments 

2018  income from operating investments net increased 5 million or 42 to 17 million in 2018 from 12 million in 2017 the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and n3b investments 

other income and gains 

2019  other income and gains decreased 14 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment in 2018 

2018  other income and gains increased 14 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2019  general and administrative expenses in 2019 decreased 83 million or 10 compared to 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by lower overhead costs and current state income tax expense partially offset by the addition of fulcrum and g2 and unfavorable changes in noncurrent state income tax expense 

2018  general and administrative expenses in 2018 increased 112 million or 15 compared to 2017 this increase was primarily driven by higher overhead costs related to increased headcount as well as higher current state income tax expense partially offset by lower noncurrent state income tax expense 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for 

goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2019  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in 2019 of 29 million at our technical solutions segment see note 13 goodwill and other intangible assets in item 8 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income 



segment operating income 

2019  segment operating income in 2019 was 631 million compared to 663 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to favorable changes in workers compensation expense in 2018 a goodwill impairment at our technical solutions segment lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program and tripoli lha 7 a loss on a fleet support services contract and recoveries related to a 2018 settlement agreement at our ingalls segment partially offset by contract changes on submarine support services higher volume at our newport news segment higher risk retirement on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act 

2018  segment operating income in 2018 was 663 million compared to 688 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to lower performance in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program lower risk retirement on tripoli lha 7 and the legend class nsc program the resolution in 2017 of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 and the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act partially offset by favorable changes in workers compensation expense recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment and an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment and operating fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with gaap and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with cas the operating fascas adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

the components of the operating fascas adjustment were as follows 



2019  the operating fascas adjustment in 2019 was a net benefit of 124 million compared to a net benefit of 290 million in 2018 the unfavorable change was primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas 

2018  the operating fascas adjustment in 2018 was a net benefit of 290 million compared to a net benefit of 205 million in 2017 the favorable change was primarily driven by impacts of lower discount and interest rates 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2020 to be a net benefit of approximately 367 million 69 million fas and 436 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of the 2019 asset returns under fas and the more immediate recognition of lower interest rates under cas 

we expect the operating fascas adjustment in 2020 to be a net benefit of approximately 247 million 189 million fas and 436 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of lower interest rates under cas the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2020 when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2019  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2019 was 19 million compared to 2 million in 2018 the increase in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by an increase in deferred state income tax expense and state uncertain tax positions the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments 

2018  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2018 was 2 million compared to 12 million in 2017 the decrease in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by a decrease in deferred state income tax expense primarily attributable to changes in pension related adjustments 

interest expense 

2019  interest expense in 2019 was 70 million compared to 58 million in 2018 the increase was primarily a result of an increase in short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program in 2019 

2018  interest expense in 2018 was 58 million compared to 94 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily a result of a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in 2017 from refinancing our 5000 senior notes due in 2021 with 3483 senior notes due in 2027 see note 15 debt in item 8 

nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the nonoperating retirement benefit expense includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

2019  an unfavorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense of 62 million from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by lower 2018 returns on plan assets 

2018  the favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense of 90 million from 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by favorable 2017 returns on plan assets 

federal and foreign income taxes 

2019  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 196 in 2019 compared to 139 in 2018 the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 was primarily attributable to claims for higher research and development tax credits for prior tax years recorded in 2018 

2018  our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 139 in 2018 compared to 380 in 2017 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 was primarily attributable to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and claims for higher research and development tax credits for prior tax years in addition the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the federal income tax rate included in the tax act 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and technical solutions 

the following table presents segment operating results 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance such as the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls 



sales and service revenues 

2019  ingalls revenues including intersegment sales decreased 52 million or 2 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower revenues in the legend class nsc program surface combatants and amphibious assault ships revenues on the legend class nsc program decreased due to lower volumes on kimball nsc 7 midgett nsc 8 and stone nsc 9 partially offset by higher volumes on nsc 11 unnamed and calhoun nsc 10 surface combatant revenues decreased as a result of lower volumes on delbert d black ddg 119 paul ignatius ddg 117 frank e petersen jr ddg 121 and lenah h sutcliffe higbee ddg 123 partially offset by higher volumes on ted stevens ddg 128 uss fitzgerald ddg 62 repair and restoration jeremiah denton ddg 129 jack h lucas ddg 125 and george m neal ddg 131 amphibious assault ship revenues decreased as a result of lower volumes on tripoli lha 7 fort lauderdale lpd 28 and the delivered uss portland lpd 27 as well as lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program partially offset by higher volumes on bougainville lha 8 harrisburg lpd 30 richard m mccool jr lpd 29 and lpd planning yard and life cycle engineering and services

segment operating income 

2019  ingalls operating income in 2019 was 235 million compared to income of 313 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program and tripoli lha 7 and recoveries related to a 2018 settlement agreement 

2018  ingalls operating income remained stable from 2017 to 2018 at 313 million as recoveries related to a settlement agreement higher risk retirement on arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and the higher volumes described above were offset by lower risk retirement on tripoli lha 7 and the legend class nsc program 

newport news 



sales and service revenues 

2019  newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased 464 million or 10 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by higher revenues in aircraft carriers submarines and naval nuclear support services aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on enterprise cvn 80 the advance planning contract for the rcoh of uss john c stennis cvn 74 and doris miller cvn 81 partially offset by lower volumes on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and john f kennedy cvn 79 submarine revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program increased as a result of higher volumes on block v and block iv boats offset by lower volumes on block iii boats naval nuclear support services revenues increased primarily as a result of contract changes on submarine support services and higher volume in facility maintenance services 

2018  newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased 558 million or 13 in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by higher revenues in aircraft carriers and naval nuclear support services partially offset by lower revenues in submarines aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 and the advance planning contract for enterprise cvn 80 partially offset by lower volumes on the inactivation of the decommissioned aircraft carrier enterprise cvn 65 and the execution contract for the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 naval nuclear support services revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes in submarine support and facility maintenance services submarine revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program decreased due to lower volumes and performance on block iii boats partially offset by higher volumes on block iv and block v boats 

segment operating income 

2019  newport news operating income in 2019 was 390 million compared to income of 318 million in 2018 the increase was primarily due to contract changes on submarine support services the higher volumes described above and higher risk retirement on the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 partially offset by favorable changes in workers compensation expense in 2018 

2018  newport news operating income in 2018 was 318 million compared to income of 354 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to lower performance in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including delaware ssn 791 and montana ssn 794 the resolution in 2017 of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 and the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act partially offset by favorable changes in workers compensation expense and the increased volume described above 

technical solutions 



sales and service revenues 

2019  technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 321 million or 32 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher mdis revenues attributable to the additions of fulcrum and g2 as well as higher fleet support and oil and gas revenues 

2018  technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 36 million or 4 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher revenues in oil and gas services and mdis services partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental and fleet support revenues 

segment operating income 

2019  operating income in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2019 was 6 million compared to operating income of 32 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment at our oil and gas reporting unit and a loss on a fleet support services contract partially offset by higher equity income from our nuclear and environmental joint ventures and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act 

2018  operating income in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2018 was 32 million compared to operating income of 21 million in 2017 the increase was primarily due to an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract and higher income from operating investments at our nuclear and environmental joint ventures partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act and lower performance in fleet support services 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2019 was approximately 465 billion total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2019 and 2018 



we expect approximately 17 of the 465 billion total backlog as of december 31 2019 to be converted into sales in 2020 us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2019 and 2018 

awards 

2019  the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31 2019 was approximately 323 billion significant new awards during the period included contracts for the detail design and construction of the gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers enterprise cvn 80 and doris miller cvn 81 block v of the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and the san antoni o class lpd 17 amphibious transport dock harrisburg lpd 30 

2018  the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31 2018 was approximately 98 billion significant new awards during the period included contracts for the construction of three arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers for the detail design and construction of richard m mccool jr  lpd 29 for procurement of longleadtime material for enterprise cvn 80 and for the construction of calhoun nsc 10 and nsc 11 unnamed 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2019  cash provided by operating activities was 896 million in 2019 compared to 914 million in 2018 the change of 18 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to a change in trade working capital partially offset by decreased funding of retiree benefit plans the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2020 in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2018  cash provided by operating activities was 914 million in 2018 compared to 814 million in 2017 the increase of 100 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to a change in trade working capital and lower income tax payments partially offset by increased funding of retiree benefit plans the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

investing activities 

2019  cash used in investing activities was 627 million in 2019 an increase of 151 million from 2018 the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of fulcrum and higher capital expenditures partially offset by the acquisiton of g2 inc in 2018 and investments in nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2018 

for 2020 we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 10 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 30 to 40 of annual revenues 

2018  cash used in investing activities was 476 million in 2018 an increase of 127 million from 2017 the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of g2 inc higher capital expenditures and investments in nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2018 partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of avondale 

financing activities 

2019  cash used in financing activities in 2019 was 434 million compared to 899 million used in 2018 the change was primarily due to decreases of 480 million of common stock repurchases and 2 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by an increase of 17 million of cash dividend payments 

2018  cash used in financing activities in 2018 was 899 million compared to 484 million used in 2017 the change was primarily due to increases of 456 million of common stock repurchases and 17 million of cash dividend payments partially offset by decreases of 31 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements and 27 million of debt related expenditures 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2019  free cash flow decreased 52 million from 2018 primarily due to a change in trade working capital and higher capital expenditures partially offset by decreased funding of retiree benefit plans 

2018  free cash flow increased 59 million from 2017 primarily due to a change in trade working capital and lower income tax payments partially offset by increased funding of retiree benefit plans and higher capital expenditures 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded statuses we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 21 million 508 million and 294 million in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 our qualified pension plans were funded 89 and 90 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2019 and 2018 these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations we expect our 2020 cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 205 million all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 31 million 30 million and 34 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we expect our 2020 contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 33 million which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis 

other sources and uses of capital 

stockholder distributions  in november 2019 our board of directors authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to  103 per share the board previously increased the quarterly cash dividend to  086 per share in november 2018 and  072 per share in november 2017 we paid cash dividends totaling  149 million 361 per share  132 million 302 per share and  115 million 252 per share in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

additional capital  in june 2018 we completed an exchange of 600 million aggregate principal amount of registered 3483 senior notes due december 2027 for all of the then outstanding unregistered senior notes due december 2027 we also have outstanding  600 million aggregate principal amount of unregistered 5000  senior notes due november 2025 interest on our senior notes is payable semiannually 

in november 2017 we terminated our second amended and restated credit agreement with thirdparty lenders and entered into a new credit agreement the credit facility with thirdparty lenders the credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of  1250 million which may be drawn upon during a period of five years from november 22 2017 the revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of  500 million the revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based upon our credit rating which may vary between 1125  and 1500  the revolving credit facility also has a commitment fee rate on the unutilized balance based on our credit rating the commitment fee rate as of december 31 2019 was 025  and may vary between 020  and 030  

as of december 31 2019 we had  16 million in issued but undrawn letters of credit and  1234 million unutilized under the credit facility 

in october 2019 we established an unsecured commercial paper note program under which we may issue up to 1 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes 

we were in compliance with all debtrelated covenants as of and during the year ended december 31 2019 for a description of our outstanding debt amounts and related restrictive covenants see note 15 debt in item 8 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2019 our total outstanding longterm debt was 1286 million consisting of senior notes and other thirdparty debt for a description of our outstanding debt amounts and related restrictive covenants see note 15 debt in item 8

we delivered the us navys newest carrier uss gerald r ford  cvn 78 in 2017 beginning in 2009 we received contract awards totaling 76 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier john f kennedy  cvn 79 in addition we have received awards valued at 152 billion for detail design and construction of the gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers enterprise cvn 80 and cvn 81 unnamed

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our total backlog was approximately 23 billion  and 21 billion  respectively we expect approximately 30  of backlog at december 31 2018  to be converted into sales in 2019  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials we use in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government for longterm contracts we generally obtain price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa 

and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems government property management systems estimating systems earned value management systems and material management accounting systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability pursuant to regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems in february 2018 we received the findings of an audit conducted by the dcaa citing potentially significant deficiencies in our newport news segments business system for material management we submitted a response in june 2018 agreeing in part and disagreeing in part with the audit findings and we and the us government continue to engage in discussions regarding the accuracy and significance of the dcaa’s findings in the event the us government makes a final determination that there are remaining significant deficiencies and that our proposed corrective actions are inadequate the us government may withhold up to 5 from our interim billings on costreimbursement laborhour and time and materials contracts at newport news containing the contractor business systems clause until the us government determines all significant deficiencies have been remediated all us government contracts at the newport news segment contain the relevant business systems provision and any related withholding could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination of a contract for convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those related to procurement our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we prepare submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins to enable the navy to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our business our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal acquisition regulation far the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act us cost accounting standards cas the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to longterm teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both virginia  class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines and columbia  class ssbn 826 ballistic missile submarines we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at costs consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we would record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving 

multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2018  our estimable probable future costs for environmental remediation were immaterial although information gained as remediation progresses may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations we do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry includes exposure to hazardous materials and processes according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced two fatalities in the past eight years we strive to keep our occupational safety and health administration osha compliance programs strong 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe each regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 40000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 5800 engineers and designers and approximately 2300 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1240 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2018  we had 947 master shipbuilders at newport news and 281 at ingalls we employ more than 7000 veterans across the enterprise 

more than 1900 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding segments each year in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives we employ approximately 4300 apprentice school alumni 3000 at newport news 1200 at ingalls and 100 at technical solutions 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and two site stabilization agreements newport news has four  collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in december 2019 november 2020 november 2021 and december 2022 the collective bargaining agreement that expires in november 2021 covers approximately 50 of newport news employees newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues in 2018  were derived from products and services sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition most of our backlog as of december 31 2018  was us government related our us government contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customer short term and long term strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional funding of us navy us coast guard and other government agency programs  the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may not recover those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual contracts or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded   representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bipartisan budget act of 2018 the “bba 2018” provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 sequestration remains in effect however for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 longterm uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding 

programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2018  our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes to customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination of a contract for the us governments convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate estimates used to calculate contract costs initially reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff cost plus award fee cpaf contracts and time and material contracts see the contract section under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 for descriptions of the types of contracts that comprise our business 

of ingalls revenues in 2018  approximately 83 were generated from fpi contracts approximately 9 were generated from cpff contracts approximately 5 were generated from cpaf contracts and approximately 3 were generated from ffp contracts of newport news 2018  revenues approximately 40 were generated from fpi contracts approximately 37 were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 23 were generated from cpif contracts of technical solutions revenues in 2018  approximately 31 were generated from cpff contracts approximately 29 were generated from ffp contracts approximately 26 were generated from time and material contracts approximately 9 were generated from fpi contracts approximately 3 were generated from cpif contracts and approximately 2 were generated from cpaf contracts to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform our contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the timing of product deliveries and other matters we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials   major components and subsystems   hardware elements   and subassemblies for our products and to perform certain services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to satisfy our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts including as a result of increases in material costs we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions in contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost recovery risk in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part on a timely compliant and costeffective basis could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to provide quality materials and services to support our programs and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and the expectations set forth in the hii supplier code of conduct in connection with the materials and services we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also work with subcontractors and suppliers to conduct technical assessments inspections and audits as necessary notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving materials and services that fail to meet specifications or requirements subcontractors and suppliers have in the past provided us with unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services 

our inability to procure or a significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations inaccurate certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance or noncompliant materials components or parts we acquire from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

the defense industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from greater dod focus on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the dods initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on our current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod in addition to dods business practice initiatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits in addition the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and other thresholds are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts our performance depends upon our ability to develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and other employees with the necessary skills and security clearances at the same time future revenues and costs impact our ability to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear related skills and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could experience difficulties performing our contracts and competing for new contract awards 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict the longer term reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 287 ships as of december 31 2018  has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards five major private united states shipyards two of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants   submarines and large deck amphibious ships we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build new and different classes of ships as well as ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and other amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard became capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement cyber security and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and risks and change on a routine basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in additional performance and compliance efforts and higher costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we are audited and reviewed on a regular basis by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational damage 

the us   government also has the ability pursuant to regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems under such regulations the us government may withhold up to 5 from our interim billings on costreimbursement laborhour and time and materials contracts containing the contractor business systems clause which is a significant majority of our us government customer contracts in february 2018 we received the findings of an audit conducted by the dcaa citing potentially significant deficiencies in our newport news segments business system for material management we submitted a response in june 2018 agreeing in part and disagreeing in part with the audit findings and we and the us government continue to engage in discussions regarding the accuracy and significance of the dcaa’s findings in the event the us government makes a final determination that there are remaining significant deficiencies and that our proposed corrective actions are inadequate the us government may withhold up to 5 from our interim billings on all us government contracts at the newport news segment until the us government determines all significant deficiencies have been remediated which could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts 

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices costs we incur that are 

determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cas if a determination is made that we engaged in illegal activities or we are not presently responsible   as defined under the far we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities or stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include technological complexity or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services utilized by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays with product development or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technologies supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule for construction the risks associated with new technologies or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management attention to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts reimbursement to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in estimates used in accounting for our contracts could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgments relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed which subjects our risk assessments revenue and cost estimates and assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our judgment   estimation   and assumption processes are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations which could adversely affect our contract performance and as a result our financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the types of events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security issues such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to negotiate and enter into insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others property loss from natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us incurring substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases for which we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and two site stabilization agreements newport news has four  collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in december 2019 november 2020 november 2021 and december 2022 the collective bargaining agreement that expires in november 2021 covers approximately 50 of newport news employees 

newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible we may 

experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have experienced in the past work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets which to a large extent are reflective of the financial markets and economic conditions changes to these estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets could significantly impact our retirement related expense the funded status of the plans and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans which could have material adverse effects on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally pension cost recoveries under cas for our us government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or the periods in which we make contributions to our plans and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries 

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to manage these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we expect to incur future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors 

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and as a result our ability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy our business has been impacted in the past by the improper misconduct of employees and business partners and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors moreover the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols and implement security controls and complementary cyber security technologies in accordance with industry compliance requirements we face cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information advanced nation state threat actors sophisticated cybercrime syndicates hacktivists and insiders can pose significant threats to our information technology infrastructure and assets while we have implemented countermeasures to address the risks posed by these threats external and internal threat actors continuously seek ways to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure assets and data 

our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners also face cyber security and other security threats although we are undertaking cooperative efforts with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to assist them with understanding the threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to defend against potential cyberattacks launched by cyber threat actors other security threats and business disruptions we rely substantially on the safeguards put in place by these entities which may affect the security of our information these entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy the doe and the nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions involve estimates assumptions and judgments to determine acquisition prices which are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses 

as of december 31 2018  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 20  and 8  respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business the ultimate taxability of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period 

changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law the tax act provided for significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended that impact corporations including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and changes or limitations to certain deductions while our accounting for provisional adjustments made in the 2017 financial statements for impacts from the tax act was completed in 2018 the internal revenue service irs did not issue guidance on all elements of the tax act in 2018 accordingly there remain certain elements of the tax act for which we cannot determine the full effects on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in future years see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences of opinions among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

as part of our business strategy we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we make significant judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of business opportunities acquisitions and investments also involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges unexpected liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and charges for impairments of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring future material cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax proceedings compliance proceedings claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary sanctions government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property the us government has begun asserting or seeking to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts which could reduce our rights in intellectual property we develop and our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

there can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels 

the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors considered in the context of then current conditions including our earnings other operating results and capital requirements declines in asset values or increases in liabilities including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes can reduce stockholders’ equity a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future in addition the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors including results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2018  we had 13 billion  of debt under our senior notes and 12 billion  of additional borrowing capacity under our credit agreement the “credit facility” our credit facility also allows us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1 billion and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt the amount of our existing debt combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future could have important consequences including 

 

in addition the interest rate on variable rate indebtedness under the credit facility is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or modified by 2021 the consequences of the discontinuance of the libor benchmark cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy consequently the us navy requires us to include in our navy contracts provisions regarding notice and approval rights for the navy in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment may have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

litigation  in 2015 we received a civil investigative demand from the department of justice doj relating to an investigation of certain allegedly nonconforming parts we purchased from one of our suppliers for use in connection with us government contracts we have cooperated with the doj in connection with its investigation in 2016 we were made aware that we are a defendant in a false claims act lawsuit filed under seal in the us district court for the middle district of florida related to our purchase of the allegedly nonconforming parts from the supplier depending upon the outcome of this matter we could be subject to civil penalties damages andor suspension or debarment from future us government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the matter remains sealed and given the current posture of the matter we are unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss or to express an opinion regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of current cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation 

we and our predecessorininterest have been in litigation with the bolivarian republic of venezuela the republic since 2002 over a contract for the repair refurbishment and modernization at ingalls of two  foreignbuilt frigates the case proceeded towards arbitration then appeared to settle favorably but the settlement was 

overturned in court and the matter returned to litigation in march 2014 we filed an arbitral statement of claim asserting breaches of the contract in july 2014 the republic filed a statement of defense in the arbitration denying all our allegations and a counterclaim alleging late redelivery of the frigates unfinished work and breach of warranty in february 2018 the arbitral tribunal awarded us approximately 151 million  on our claims and awarded the republic approximately 22 million  on its counterclaims we have filed a petition in the united states district court for the district of columbia asking the court to confirm or enforce the award no assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate resolution of this matter 

we are party to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business including us government investigations that could result in administrative civil or criminal proceedings involving us we are a contractor with the us government and such proceedings could therefore include additional false claims act allegations against us although we believe that the resolution of these other claims legal proceedings and investigations will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our business 

huntington ingalls industries inc is america’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry for more than a century our ingalls segment in mississippi and newport news segment in virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other us naval shipbuilder we also provide a range of services to the governmental energy and oil and gas markets through our technical solutions segment headquartered in newport news virginia hii employs approximately 40000  people both domestically and internationally 

we conduct most of our business with the us government primarily the dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs ingalls includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses newport news includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses our technical solutions segment provides a wide range of professional services including fleet support mdis nuclear and environmental and oil and gas services 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021 the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bba 2018 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and raised the budget topline for defense and nondefense discretionary spending however sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 longterm uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure 

while appropriations measures that fund the dod doe and a limited number of other federal agencies have been enacted for fiscal year 2019 appropriations to fund the balance of the federal government for fiscal year 2019 have not been enacted and congress and the administration have thus far been unable to agree on funding for those agencies we cannot predict the impact that sequestration cuts reprioritization of readiness and modernization investment or lack of appropriations to fund a portion of the us government for fiscal year 2019 may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures that result from sequestration and other budget priorities will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress and the current presidential 

administration continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the 2018 national defense strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the reemergence of longterm strategic competition between nations america also faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield combined across domains and conducted at increasing speed and reach the security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war the drive to develop new technologies is relentless expanding to more actors with lower barriers of entry and moving at accelerating speed new technologies include advanced computing “big data” analytics artificial intelligence autonomy robotics directed energy hypersonics and biotechnology 

we expect that execution of the dod strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in restoring the readiness of the current force with investments in new capabilities technologies and capacity to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while still facing additional budget cuts from sequestration while the bba 2018 provided relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 bca spending caps coupled with other budget priorities could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in december 2016 the us navy released the findings of a yearlong force structure assessment developed to determine the right balance of existing forces the ships currently under construction and the future procurement plans needed to address the everevolving and increasingly complex threats that the navy is required to counter notably the force structure assessment did not present a desired force size the us navy would pursue if resources were not constrained it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success accordingly the force structure assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships comprised of 12 aircraft carriers 104 large surface combatants 52 small surface combatants 38 amphibious warfare ships 66 attack submarines 12 ballistic missile submarines 32 combat logistics ships 10 expeditionaryhigh speed transports 6 expeditionary support bases and 23 command and support ships additionally the 2018 national defense authorization act included the ships act which made it the policy of our nation to achieve a fleet size of 355 ships 

the us navy’s 2019 fiveyear shipbuilding plan includes 54 new ships 12 more than the 42 ships included in the navy’s 2018 fiveyear plan and 11 more than were included in the fiscal year 2018 budget request similarly the us navy’s fiscal year 2019 30year shipbuilding plan also increased the ship count by including 301 new ships 47 more than the 254 ships included in the navy’s fiscal year 2017 30year plan 

while the force objective of 355 ships reflected in the 2016 force structure assessment still pertains and has been memorialized as national policy by the 2018 ships act both the congressional research service and congressional budget office have estimated that additional ships would need to be added to the us navy’s 30year plan to achieve the 355 ship objective unless the navy extends the service lives of existing ships and reactivates recently retired ships 

in december 2018 the us navy also released its “design for maintaining maritime superiority version 20” the design which expands upon a posture initially put forth in january 2016 under version 10 of the design the new plan calls for four specific lines of effort strengthening naval power at and from the sea achieving highvelocity outcomes strengthening the us navy team of the future and expanding and strengthening the navy’s network of partners each line of effort calls for specific recommendations that are intended to make the us navy more agile more competitive and tougher as a means of strengthening naval power the plan expresses award date goals for several major programs including the future frigate and large surface combatant other initiatives include integrating more artificial intelligence and machine learning into warfare systems developing and fielding a family of directed energy weapons as well as employment of 3d printing for replacement parts 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by an increasingly fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys littoral combat ship and have expressed interest in the future frigate program 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control additionally the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities nondefense discretionary spending and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding while the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our contracts typically fall into one of four categories firm fixedprice fixedprice incentive costtype and time and materials see note 8 revenue 

 

 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria we consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider our policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the requirements of accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 and related amendments  prior to january 1 2018 we recognized revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 60535 constructiontype and productiontype contracts utilizing the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting primarily based upon total costs incurred with incentive fees included in sales when the amounts could be reasonably determined and estimated  amounts representing change orders claims requests for equitable adjustment or limitations of funding were included in sales only when they could be reliably estimated and realization was probable for services contracts not associated with the design development manufacture or modification of complex equipment revenues were recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured costs related to these contracts were expensed as incurred for additional information on the new standard and the impact to our results of operations refer to note 3 accounting standards updates in item 8 

most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the us government which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a costtocost measure of progress the use of the costtocost method to measure performance progress over time is supported by clauses in the related contracts that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process 

when the customer is not a us government entity we may recognize revenue over time or at a point in time when control transfers upon delivery depending upon the facts and circumstances of the related arrangement when we determine that revenue should be recognized over time we utilize a measure of progress that best depicts the transfer of control of the relevant goods and services to the customer generally the terms and conditions of the contracts result in a transfer of control over the related goods and services as we satisfy our performance obligations accordingly we recognize revenue over time using the costtocost method to measure performance progress we may however utilize a measure of progress other than costtocost such as a laborbased measure of progress if the terms and conditions of the arrangement require such accounting 

when using the costtocost method to measure performance progress certain contracts may include costs that are not representative of performance progress such as large upfront purchases of uninstalled materials 

unexpected waste or inefficiencies in these cases we adjust our measure of progress to exclude such costs with the goal of better reflecting the transfer of control over the related goods or services to the customer and recognizing revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred that reflect our performance under the contract 

in addition for time and material arrangements we often utilize the practical expedient allowing the recognition of revenue in the amount we invoice which corresponds with the value provided to the customer and to which we are entitled to payment for performance to date 

a performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for which revenue is recognized to determine the proper revenue recognition method consideration is given to whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one contract and whether a single contract consists of more than one performance obligation for contracts with multiple performance obligations the contract transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price based upon expected cost plus a margin at contract inception which is generally the price disclosed in the contract contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements in the majority of circumstances modifications do not result in additional performance obligations that are distinct from the existing performance obligations in the contract and the effects of the modifications are recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catchup basis alternatively in instances in which the performance obligations in the modifications are deemed distinct contract modifications are accounted for prospectively 

the amount of revenue recognized as we satisfy performance obligations associated with contracts with customers is based upon the determination of transaction price transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled for performance under the terms and conditions of the relevant contract and may reflect fixed and variable components including shareline incentive fees whereby the value of the contract is variable based upon the amount of costs incurred as well as other incentive fees based upon achievement of contractual schedule commitments or other specified criteria in the contract shareline incentive fees are determined based upon the formula under the relevant contract using our estimated cost to complete for each period we generally utilize a most likely amount approach to estimate variable consideration in all such instances the estimated revenues represent those amounts for which we believe a significant reversal of revenue is not probable 

contract estimates   in estimating contract costs we utilize a profitbooking rate based upon performance expectations that takes into consideration a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements feasibility schedule and contract costs management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks which may increase the profitbooking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks conversely if we are not able to retire these risks cost estimates may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any performance delays the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 

changes in estimates of sales costs and profits on a performance obligation are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods 

for the years ended   december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2018  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend  class nsc program uss portland  lpd 27 and fort lauderdale  lpd 28 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program including lower performance on delaware ssn 791 and montana ssn 794 and other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended   december 31 2017  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the legend class nsc program tripoli  lha 7 uss portland  lpd 27 and the delivered uss john finn  ddg 113 the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

for the year ended   december 31 2016  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on uss john p murtha  lpd 26 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program uss portland lpd 27 the legend class nsc program and the arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyer program during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 and construction of uss gerald r ford  cvn 78 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

when estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned on a performance obligation related to a complex constructiontype contract we recognize a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation in the period the loss is determined 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was 1263 million  and 1217 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a goodwill adjustment of 17 million in the technical solutions segment primarily driven by the finalization of fair value calculations for certain assets and liabilities as well as the net working capital adjustment related to the acquisition of camber holding corporation camber 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we record a charge to operations 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2018  impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2018  

november 30 2017 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2017 

november 30 2016 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2016 

in conjunction with the realignment of our operations on december 1 2016 we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair values of the reporting units being realigned as a result during the fourth quarter of 2016 we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately after the realignment for each of the reporting units impacted by our realignment based on this quantitative assessment no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment 

other intangible assets   we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or 

circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government examinations inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental liability accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of each of december 31 2018  and 2017  were immaterial see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2018  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of facilities currently in use may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate 

resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of a tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income within segment operating income and nonoperating retirement benefit expense as required by a new accounting standard for additional information on the new standard and the impact to our results of operations refer to note 3 accounting standards updates in item 8 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to lower levels over the next few years the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act “hatfa” in 2014 and the bipartisan budget act of 2015 successively provided for the continuation of pension relief and higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phaseout period we consider the effects of pension relief legislation in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization was intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualified for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflected the effects of the rule harmonization affected pension costs on contracts over a phasein period that ended in 2017 our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions noted above because of the method permitted under harmonization we use to determine the cas interest rate which is a current market rate 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event such as an amendment curtailment   or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 434  and 382  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 433  and 385  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 725  expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2018 pension expense and we anticipate retaining that assumption throughout 2019 

mortality   mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2018  the actual return on assets was approximately minus 64 which was less than the expected return assumption of 725 for the year ended 

december 31 2018  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 52 and 48 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of 827 million and an actuarial gain of 538 million respectively for the year ended 

december 31 2018  

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



assuming a 725 expected return on assets assumption a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 1 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost   in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond yields or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds since harmonization became fully phased in during 2017 the greater of the two liabilities is used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality corporate bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization prior to the full phasing in of harmonization the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities was required 

other fas and cas pension considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants under cas harmonization the amortization period changed from 15 to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustment in 2018  was a net benefit of 364 million  the favorable  change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by more immediate recognition of the 2017 asset gains under fas and the impacts of lower discount and interest rates and other experience gains and losses and assumptions changes eg mortality the fascas adjustment in 2017  and 2016  was a net benefit of 189 million  and 145 million  respectively the favorable  change from 2016 to 2017 was driven by the final phasein of harmonization our projected 2019 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds private partnerships collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive loss  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 17 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2018  and 2017  were 1692 million  and 1459 million  respectively the increase in these actuarial losses in 2018  was primarily driven by actual asset returns which were 827 million below expected returns 78 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses and a 538 million actuarial gain due to the increase in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2018  and 2017  were 46 million  and 47 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the change in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2018  primarily resulted from amendments within a collective bargaining agreement offset by the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 289  and 235  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 32 million or 38 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 845 million  and 925 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively

consolidated operating results 

the following table presents selected financial highlights 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 

2018   product sales in 2018   increased   450 million  or 8  from 2017  product sales at our ingalls segment increased 182 million in 2018  primarily as a result of higher volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower volumes in the legend  class nsc program newport news product sales increased 284 million in 2018

service revenues in 2017   increased   431 million  or 30  from 2016  service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 41 million in 2017  as a result of higher volumes in surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 57 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in naval nuclear support services and submarines services partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carriers services service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 333 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in mdis services following the december 2016 acquisition of camber and higher volumes in fleet support and oil and gas services 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2018   cost of product sales in 2018   increased   350 million  or 8  compared to 2017  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 171 million in 2018  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above lower risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and the legend  class nsc program and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 264 million in 2018  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 23 million in 2018  primarily due to the lower volumes described above and an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 62 million from 2017  to 2018  

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased  from 767  in 2017  to 768  in 2018  primarily due to lower risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and the legend  class nsc program as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act offset by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2017   cost of product sales in 2017   increased   40 million  or 1  compared to 2016  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 64 million in 2017  primarily as a result of lower risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program following delivery of uss john p murtha  lpd 26 in 2016 as well as the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 56 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 partially offset by lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 56 million in 2017  primarily due to the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract partially offset by the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 cost of product sales related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 24 million from 2016  to 2017  

cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased  from 752  in 2016  to 767  in 2017  primarily driven by lower risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program following delivery of uss john p murtha  lpd 26 in 2016 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers as well as the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 

cost of service revenues   

2018   cost of service revenues in 2018   increased   222 million  or 14  compared to 2017  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 3 million in 2018  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 244 million in 2018  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 4 million in 2018  primarily due to one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 23 million from 2017  to 2018  

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased  from 822  in 2017  to 817  in 2018    primarily driven by the resolution in 2017 of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act partially offset by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2017    cost of service revenues in 2017   increased   328 million  or 27  compared to 2016  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 23 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 30 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 293 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues related to the operating fascas adjustment decreased 18 million from 2016  to 2017  

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased  from 841  in 2016  to 822  in 2017  primarily driven by a favorable change in the operating fascas adjustment the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 improved performance in oil and gas services and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2018   income from operating investments net increased   5 million  or 42  to 17 million  in 2018  from 12 million  in 2017  the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns and n3b investments 

2017    income from operating investments net increased   6 million  or 100  to 12 million  in 2017  from 6 million  in 2016  the increase resulted from higher equity income from our srns investment 

other income and gains 

2018   other income and gains increased 14 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment 

2017    other income and gains decreased 15 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease resulted from state and local government grants at our newport news segment in 2016 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2018   general and administrative expenses in 2018   increased   112 million  or 15  compared to 2017  this increase was primarily driven by higher overhead costs related to increased headcount as well as higher current state income tax expense partially offset by lower noncurrent state income tax expense 

2017    general and administrative expenses in 2017   decreased   9 million  or 1  compared to 2016  this decrease was primarily driven by lower overhead costs partially offset by higher noncurrent state income tax expense 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income 



segment operating income 

2018   segment operating income in 2018  was 663 million  compared to 688 million  in 2017  the decrease  was primarily due to lower performance in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program lower risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and the legend  class nsc program the resolution in 2017 of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 as well as one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act partially offset by favorable changes in workers compensation expense recoveries related to a settlement agreement at our ingalls segment and an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

2017   segment operating income in 2017  was 688 million  compared to 715 million  in 2016  the decrease  was primarily due to lower risk retirement on the delivered uss john p murtha  lpd 26 lower volume and risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers favorable changes in overhead costs in 2016 the receipt in 2016 of a local government incentive grant and the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and uss portland  lpd 27 the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and improved performance in oil and gas services 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment and operating fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with gaap and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with cas the operating fascas adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

the components of the operating fascas adjustment were as follows 



2018   the operating fascas adjustment in 2018  was a net benefit of 290 million  compared to a net benefit of 205 million  in 2017  the favorable  change was primarily driven by impacts of lower discount and interest rates 

2017   the operating fascas adjustment in 2017  was a net benefit of  205 million  compared to a net benefit of 163 million  in 2016  the favorable  change was primarily driven by the finalization of harmonization 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2019  to be a net benefit of approximately 159 million 139 million fas and 298 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of the 2018 asset loss under fas and the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas 

we expect the operating fascas adjustment in 2019  to be a net benefit of approximately 147 million 151 million fas and 298 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of higher interest rates under cas the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2019  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2018   noncurrent state income tax expense  in 2018  was 2 million  compared to 12 million  in 2017  the decrease in noncurrent state income tax expense was driven by a decrease in deferred state income tax expense primarily attributable to changes in pension related adjustments 

2017   noncurrent state income tax expense  in 2017  was 12 million  compared to 2 million  in 2016  deferred state income tax expense in 2017 was 12 million compared to deferred state income tax expense of 8 million in 2016 the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in pension related adjustments in 2017 the decrease in state uncertain tax positions resulted in a net tax benefit of less than 1 million compared to a tax benefit of 6 million in 2016 in 2016 a state uncertain tax position was settled through agreement with the applicable taxing authority and was partially offset by the recognition of a noncurrent state tax expense in a different jurisdiction impacted by the results of the settlement see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

interest expense 

2018   interest expense in 2018  was 58 million  compared to 94 million  in 2017  the decrease  was primarily a result of a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in 2017 from refinancing our 5000 senior notes due in 2021 with 3483 senior notes due in 2027 see note 14 debt in item 8 

2017   interest expense in 2017  was 94 million  compared to 74 million  in 2016  the increase  was primarily a result of a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2017 see note 14 debt in item 8 

nonoperating retirement benefit expense 

the nonoperating retirement benefit expense includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost credit and actuarial loss gain and settlement and curtailment effects 

2018   the favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense of 90 million  from 2017  to 2018  was primarily driven by favorable 2017 returns on plan assets 

2017    the favorable change in the nonoperating retirement benefit expense from 2016  to 2017  was 2 million  

federal and foreign income taxes   

2018    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 139  in 2018  compared to 380  in 2017  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 is primarily attributable to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and claims for higher research and development tax credits for prior tax years in addition the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the federal income tax rate included in the tax act 

2017   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 380  in 2017  compared to 269  in 2016  the increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 was primarily attributable to the revaluation of net deferred tax 

assets resulting from the decrease in the federal tax rate included in the tax act and a decrease in the domestic manufacturing deduction primarily resulting from an increase in our 2018 expected discretionary pretax pension contributions see note 13 income taxes in item 8

the following table presents segment operating results 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance such as the operating fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided

newport news

technical solutions 



sales and service revenues 

2018   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2018  increased   36 million  or 4  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher revenues in oil and gas services and mdis services partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental and fleet support revenues 

2017   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2017  increased   261 million  or 38  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher volume in mdis services following the 

december 2016 acquisition of camber and higher volumes in fleet support and oil and gas services partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental volumes due to the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

segment operating income 

2018   operating income  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2018  was 32 million  compared to operating income  of 21 million  in 2017  the increase  was primarily due to an allowance for accounts receivable in 2017 on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract and higher income from operating investments at our nuclear and environmental joint ventures partially offset by one time employee bonus payments in 2018 related to the tax act and lower performance in fleet support services 

2017   operating income  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2017  was 21 million  compared to operating income  of 8 million  in 2016  the increase was primarily due to improved performance in oil and gas services and higher volume in mdis services following the december 2016 acquisition of camber partially offset by the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 and the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2018  was approximately 23 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2018  and 2017  



we expect approximately 30  of the 23 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2018  to be converted into sales in 2019  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

awards 

2018   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2018  was approximately 98 billion significant new awards during the period included contracts for the construction of three arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers for the detail design and construction of richard m mccool jr  lpd 29 for procurement of longleadtime material for enterprise  cvn 80 and for the construction of nsc 10 unnamed and nsc 11 unnamed 

in addition we received awards in 2019 valued at 152 billion for detail design and construction of the gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers enterprise cvn 80 and cvn 81 unnamed 

2017   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2017  was approximately 81 billion significant new awards during this period included the detailed design and construction contract for bougainville  lha 8 and the execution contract for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2018   cash provided by  operating activities was 914 million  in 2018  compared to 814 million  in 2017  the increase of 100 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to a change in trade working capital and lower income tax payments partially offset by increased funding of retiree benefit plans the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2019  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2017   cash provided by  operating activities was 814 million  in 2017  compared to 822 million  in 2016  the decrease of 8 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to increased funding of retiree benefit plans and the change in deferred income taxes partially offset by a change in trade working capital the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

  

investing activities 

2018   cash used in  investing activities was 476 million  in 2018  an increase  of 127 million  from 2017  the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of g2 inc higher capital expenditures and investments in nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2018 partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of avondale 

for 2019  we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 15 to 20 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 35 to 40 of annual revenues 

2017   cash used in  investing activities was 349 million  in 2017  a decrease  of 304 million  from 2016  the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of camber in 2016 partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017 

financing activities 

2018   cash used in  financing activities in 2018  was 899 million  compared to 484 million   used in   2017  the change was primarily due to increases of 456 million of common stock repurchases and 17 million of cash dividend payments partially offset by decreases of 31 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements and 27 million of debt related expenditures 

2017   cash used in  financing activities in 2017  was 484 million  compared to 343 million   used in   2016  the change was primarily due to increases of 92 million of common stock repurchases 27 million of debt related expenditures 17 million of cash dividend payments and 5 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2018   free cash flow increased 59 million  from 2017  primarily due to a change in trade working capital and lower income tax payments partially offset by increased funding of retiree benefit plans and higher capital expenditures 

2017   free cash flow decreased 84 million  from 2016  primarily due to increased funding of retiree benefit plans higher capital expenditures and a change in trade working capital 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded statuses we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 508 million  294 million  and 167 million  in the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our qualified pension plans were funded 90 and 89 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2018  and 2017  these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations we expect our 2019  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 21 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 30 million  34 million  and 32 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect our 2019  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 33 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis

newport news 

the core business of our newport news segment is designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships our newport news shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction refueling and complex overhaul and inactivation of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to newport news operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has designed and built more than 30 aircraft carriers for the us navy since 1933 including all ten nimitz class cvn 68 aircraft carriers currently in active service as well as the first ship of the next generation gerald r ford  class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier uss gerald r ford  cvn 78 in 2017 we also received awards in 2009 through 2016 totaling 76 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier john f kennedy  cvn 79 and awards totaling 392 million for advance planning and longlead time material acquisition for the third gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier enterprise cvn 80 

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes nearly four years to complete with the work accounting for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and fleet support across the globe 

in 2017 we completed the rcoh for uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and redelivered the ship to the us navy we are currently performing the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our rcoh performance on the first six nimitz class cvn 68 carriers and our highly trained workforce as well as the fact that rcoh work is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for rcoh contract awards on the remaining nimitz class cvn 68 carriers as well as future work on gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

the us navy awarded us a 745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 the decommissioned enterprise cvn 65 inactivation is scheduled to be completed in 2018 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten nimitz class cvn 68 carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans we believe we are well positioned as the us navys shipyard of choice for these contract awards 

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 60  submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 46  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 52 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 25 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat corporation electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build virginia class ssn 774 fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines alternate between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and six submarines of the second block of virginia class ssn 774 submarines have been delivered in 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight virginia class ssn 774 submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year the first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014 and the last submarine of the third block is scheduled for delivery in 2019 in 2014 the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten virginia class ssn 774 submarines continuing the two submarines per year production rate the first submarine of the block iv contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019 and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2023 

columbia class ssbn 826 submarines 

newport news is participating in designing the columbia class ssbn 826 submarine as a replacement for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 the ohio class ssbn includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the columbia class ssbn 826 program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarines and in early 2017 the dod signed the acquisition decision memorandum approving the columbia  class ssbn 826 program’s milestone b which formally authorizes the program’s entry into the engineering and manufacturing development phase we continue to perform design work as a subcontractor to electric boat and we have entered into a teaming agreement with electric boat to build modules for the entire columbia class ssbn 826 submarine program that leverages our virginia class ssn 774 experience the teaming agreement is subject to the us navys concurrence newport news was awarded a contract from electric boat in 2017 to begin integrated product and process development for the columbia class construction of the first columbia class ssbn 826 submarine is expected to begin in 2021 with procurement of longleadtime materials and advance construction beginning prior to that time we believe the columbia class ssbn 826 of submarines represents a significant future opportunity

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 9 segment information in item 8 

customers 

our revenues are primarily derived from the us government in 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 87 89 and 89 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 6 6 and 7 respectively were generated from the us coast guard in 2017  2016  and 2015  we generated approximately 3 4 and 3 respectively of our revenues from commercial customers and 4 1 and 1 respectively from other government agencies 

intellectual property 

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government receives nonexclusive licenses to our intellectual property developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the intellectual property licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of each of december 31 2017  and 2016  our total backlog was approximately 21 billion  we expect approximately 31  of backlog at december 31 2017  to be converted into sales in 2018  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials we use in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection 

with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations to facilitate innovative product development and evolution our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 17 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  and 19 million  for each of the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it includes a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review in the past the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that significant deficiencies existed with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we must modify our affected business systems to address the us governments determinations 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination of a contract for convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on 

the related program termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those related to procurement our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we prepare submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins to enable the navy to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our business our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal acquisition regulation far the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

although we have competed with another large defense contractor to construct a large deck amphibious ship which was awarded to us we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard and strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to a longterm teaming agreement with the other company for the production of such vessels we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we would record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2017  our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately 1 million  which were accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard avondale we may incur additional environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of shipbuilding at avondale any additional costs are not reasonably estimable at this time due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly such potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 1 million  accrual for environmental remediation costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant portion of any future environmental remediation costs we might incur at avondale would be recoverable in accordance with government accounting practices under the far 

  

we believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws but we expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industries according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced one fatality in the past seven years we strive to keep our occupational safety and health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work our cmsd facility has also been certified as an osha vpp star site 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe each regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 38000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 5400 engineers and designers and approximately 2400 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1450 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2017  we had 1091 master shipbuilders at newport news and 355 at ingalls we employ more than 6000 veterans across the enterprise 

more than 1500 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding units each year in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives we employ approximately 4500 apprentice alumni 3000 at newport news and 1500 at ingalls 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and two site stabilization agreements newport news has four  collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees one of which covers approximately 50 of newport news employees and was renewed in july 2017 the remaining collective bargaining agreements at newport news expire in august 2018 december 2018 and november 2020 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues in 2017  were derived from products and services sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition most of our backlog as of december 31 2017  was us government related our us government contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional funding of us navy and us coast guard programs  the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for recovery of those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual contracts or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded   representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bipartisan budget act of 2018 the “bba 2018” provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 sequestration remains in effect however for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 longterm uncertainty is continuing with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2017  our aircraft carrier 

programs accounted for approximately 31 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes to customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little or no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination of a contract for the us governments convenience a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate estimates used to calculate contract costs initially reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which cost overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us government and us the us government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a contract formula that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls revenues in 2017 approximately 89 were generated from fpi contracts approximately 5 were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 3 were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 3 were generated from ffp contracts of newport news 2017 revenues approximately 50 were generated from cpff contracts approximately 41 were generated from fpi contracts and approximately 9 were generated from cpif contracts of technical solutions revenues in 2017 approximately 33 were generated from time and material contracts approximately 28 were generated from cpff contracts approximately 29 were generated from ffp contracts approximately 7 were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 1 were generated from fpi contracts and approximately 2 were generated from cpif contracts to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform our contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based among other matters upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials   major components and subsystems   hardware elements   and subassemblies for our products and to perform certain services we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts including as a result of increases in material costs we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions in some of our contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part in a timely compliant or costeffective manner could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to provide quality materials and services to support our programs and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws regulations and the expectations set forth in the hii supplier code of conduct regarding the materials and services we procure from them in some circumstances we rely on representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance we also work with subcontractors and suppliers to conduct technical assessments inspections and audits as necessary notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving materials and services that fail to meet specifications or requirements subcontractors and suppliers have in the past provided us with unauthorized noncompliant or deficient materials and services 

our inability to procure or a significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations inaccurate certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance or noncompliant materials components or parts we acquire from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

the defense industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from an increased focus by dod on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the dods initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on our current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod in addition to dods business practice initiatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits in addition the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and other thresholds are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts our success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and workers with the necessary skills and security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties performing our contracts and attracting new contract awards 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict the reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 280 ships as of december 31 2017  has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants   submarines and large deck amphibious ships we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build other ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and other amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard became capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement cyber security and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and risks and change on a routine basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review in the past the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies existed with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we must modify our affected business systems to address the us governments determinations     

  

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards if a determination is made that we engaged in illegal activities or did not act responsibly   as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations 

penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities or stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include technological complexity or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technology that is supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule for construction the risks associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed which subjects our risk assessments revenue and cost estimates and assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our judgment   estimation   and assumption processes are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations which could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the types of events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to negotiate and enter into insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others property loss from natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has four collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees one of which covers approximately 50 of newport news employees and was renewed in july 2017 the remaining collective bargaining agreements at newport news expire in august 2018 december 2018 and november 2020 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2022 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and we negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our earnings financial condition and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm returns on assets will result in future changes in pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding of the plans 

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we expect to continue to incur costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we ceased shipbuilding construction at our avondale louisiana shipyard in 2014 our wind down of operations at this shipyard may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors 

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we also access these markets to obtain credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and arrange for letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening capital markets could also adversely affect our suppliers and subcontractors ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers or subcontractors ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy our business has been impacted in the past by the improper misconduct of employees and business partners and we may not prevent all such misconduct in the future by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors moreover the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational damage 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners face cyber security and other security threats although we work cooperatively with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats other security threats and business disruptions we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities which may affect the security of our information these entities have 

varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments to determine acquisition prices which prices are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as of december 31 2017  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 19  and 8  respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are 

based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

in 2015 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 75 million at our technical solutions segment within the oil and gas reporting unit the oil and gas reporting unit is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry the goodwill impairment charges were primarily driven by continuing declines in oil prices and the resulting decreases in industry market multiples in 2015 we also recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of 27 million  at our technical solutions segment as a result of declining market conditions and updated expectations 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business the ultimate tax determination of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period 

changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law the tax act provides for significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended that impact corporations including a reduction of the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and changes or limitations to certain deductions while our accounting for elements of the tax act is incomplete we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of certain provisions of the tax act and recorded corresponding provisional adjustments there remain certain elements for which we cannot yet make reasonable estimates however and we cannot determine at this time the full effects in future years of the tax act on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations these joint ventures may not be subject to the same 

requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

as part of our business strategy we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of business opportunities in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges unexpected liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and charges for impairments of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring future material cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property the us government has begun asserting or seeking to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts the us governments efforts could reduce our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise 

become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

there can be no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels 

the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors considered in the context of then current conditions including our earnings other operating results and capital requirements declines in asset values or increases in liabilities including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes can reduce stockholders’ equity a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future in addition the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase programs is within the discretion of management and will depend upon many factors including results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2017  we had 1279 million  of debt under our senior notes and 1235 million  of additional borrowing capacity under our credit agreement the “credit facility” our credit facility also allows us to solicit lenders to provide incremental financing in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1000 million and the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our incurrence of debt the amount of our existing debt combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future could have important consequences including 

 

to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy consequently the us navy requires us to include in our contracts with the navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights for the navy in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses in order to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such 

provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on navy and coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and took remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we provided information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies and agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million  in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy subsequently reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million  to 47 million  and the us coast guard reduced its withhold from 58 million  to 36 million  in september 2017 the us navy and the us coast guard paid us the respective remaining amounts they were withholding 

in june 2015 the us department of justice doj informed us that it was investigating the matters we disclosed to the dod in january 2013 in august 2017 we settled the matters with the doj the settlement did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

litigation  in 2015 we received a civil investigative demand from the doj relating to an investigation of certain allegedly nonconforming parts we purchased from one of our suppliers for use in connection with us government contracts we have cooperated with the doj in connection with its investigation in 2016 we were made aware that we are a defendant in a false claims act lawsuit filed under seal in the us district court for the middle district of florida related to our purchase of the allegedly nonconforming parts from the supplier depending upon the outcome of this matter we could be subject to civil penalties damages andor suspension or debarment from future us government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the matter remains sealed and given the current posture of the matter we are unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss or to express an opinion regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of current cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation 

we and our predecessorininterest have been in litigation with the bolivarian republic of venezuela the “republic” since 2002 over a contract for the repair refurbishment and modernization at ingalls of two foreignbuilt frigates the case proceeded towards arbitration then appeared to settle favorably but the settlement was overturned in court and the matter returned to litigation in march 2014 we filed an arbitral statement of claim asserting breaches of the contract and 173 million  in damages plus substantial interest and litigation expenses in 

july 2014 the republic filed in the arbitration a statement of defense denying all our allegations and a counterclaim alleging late redelivery of the frigates unfinished work and breach of warranty and asserting damages of 61 million  plus interest an arbitration hearing was held in january 2015 and we cannot predict when the arbitration panel will render a decision no assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

we are party to various other claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business although we believe that the resolution of these other claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our business 

huntington ingalls industries inc is america’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry for more than a century our ingalls segment in mississippi and newport news segment in virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other us naval shipbuilder we also provide a range of services to the governmental energy and oil and gas markets through our technical solutions segment headquartered in newport news virginia hii employs approximately 38000  people operating both domestically and internationally 

we conduct most of our business with the us government primarily the dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs ingalls includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses newport news includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses our technical solutions segment provides a wide range of professional services including fleet support integrated missions solutions nuclear and environmental and oil and gas services 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021 the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bba 2018 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and raised the budget topline for defense and nondefense discretionary spending however sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 longterm uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending across the future years defense plan and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure 

we cannot predict the impact that sequestration cuts or reprioritization of readiness and modernization investment may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures that result from sequestration and other budget priorities will have serious implications for defense discretionary spending the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress and the new administration continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the 2018 national defense strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the reemergence of longterm strategic competition between nations america also faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield combined across domains and conducted at increasing speed and reach the security environment is also affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war the drive to develop new technologies is relentless expanding to more actors with lower barriers of entry and moving at accelerating speed new technologies include advanced computing “big data” analytics artificial intelligence autonomy robotics directed energy hypersonics and biotechnology 

states are the principal actors on the global stage but nonstate actors also threaten the security environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities terrorists transnational criminal organizations cyber hackers and other malicious nonstate actors have increased capabilities of mass disruption terrorism remains a persistent condition driven by ideology and unstable political and economic structures 

we expect that the dod execution of its strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in restoring the readiness of the current force with investments in new capabilities technologies and capacity to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while still facing additional budget cuts from sequestration while the bba 2018 provided relief for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for 2020 and beyond bca spending caps coupled with other budget priorities could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in december 2016 the us navy released the findings of a yearlong force structure assessment developed to determine the right balance of existing forces the ships currently under construction and the future procurement plans needed to address the everevolving and increasingly complex threats that the navy is required to counter notably the force structure assessment did not present a desired force size the us navy would pursue if resources were not constrained it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success accordingly the force structure assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships comprised of 12 aircraft carriers 104 large surface combatants 52 small surface combatants 38 amphibious warfare ships 66 attack submarines 12 ballistic missile submarines 32 combat logistics ships 10 expeditionaryhigh speed transports 6 expeditionary support bases and 23 command and support ships additionally the 2018 national defense authorization act included the ships act which made it the policy of our nation to achieve a fleet size of 355 ships it remains unclear however whether the 2016 force structure assessment or the requirements of the ships act will have any bearing on budget outcomes for fiscal year 2019 and beyond 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys littoral combat ship the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities nondefense discretionary spending and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the administration has focused on regulatory reform in order to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with federal regulations additionally an executive order issued in february 2017 requires that for every new regulation issued at least two prior regulations must be identified for elimination and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control while the impact to our business resulting from these initiatives remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these 

policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we have other types of contracts such as services and commercial arrangements for which revenues are recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured costs related to these contracts are expensed as incurred we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2017  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the legend class nsc program tripoli  lha 7 portland  lpd 27 and the delivered uss john finn  ddg 113 the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and other individually insignificant adjustments during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

for the year ended   december 31 2016  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on uss john p murtha  lpd 26 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program portland lpd 27 the legend class nsc program and the arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyer program during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 and construction of gerald r ford  cvn 78 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend class nsc program and the san antonio class lpd 17 program including delivered ships the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the america class lha 6 program and the rcoh of uss theodore roosevelt  cvn 71 and contract impacts of the aon litigation settlement during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on gerald r ford  cvn 78  as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was 1217 million  and 1234 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded a goodwill adjustment of 17 million  in the technical solutions segment primarily driven by the finalization of fair value calculations for certain assets and liabilities as well as the net working capital adjustment related to the acquisition of camber 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying 

value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we record a charge to operations 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2017  impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2017  

november 30 2016 impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2016 

in conjunction with the realignment of our operations on december 1 2016 we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair values of the reporting units being realigned as a result during the fourth quarter of 2016 we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately after the realignment for each of the reporting units impacted by our realignment based on this quantitative assessment no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment 

november 30 2015 and december 31 2015 impairment tests  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2015 and while the annual impairment test did not result in an impairment considering the limited excess fair value of goodwill over its carrying value in our oil and gas reporting unit and the continued decline in oil prices and related industry activity levels we performed an interim assessment of goodwill as of december 31 2015 our determination of fair value as of december 31 2015 considered industry events that occurred in the period since our annual goodwill impairment test as well as the updated long term outlook for this reporting unit those events included continued deterioration in the oil and gas markets numerous industrywide project deferrals and capital spending cuts announced by industry leaders the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of december 31 2015 and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 16 million  at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2015 

may 31 2015 impairment test  we continuously monitor industry events and changes in circumstances in the industries in which our reporting units conduct business in consideration of the oil and gas reporting unit’s sensitivity to developments within its industry the continued decline in crude oil prices significant reductions in its customer capital spending plans and project delays we concluded an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our oil and gas reporting unit was still higher than its carrying value as of may 31 2015 our assessment considered the aforementioned changes to expectations that were considered as part of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2014 as a result of our analysis we recorded a 59 million  goodwill impairment charge at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the second quarter of 2015 

other intangible assets   we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

december 31 2015 impairment test   we performed an impairment test as of december 31 2015 on the amortizable intangible assets that arose from the upi acquisition which reside in our oil and gas reporting unit within our technical solutions segment the oil and gas asset group’s longlived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and to a lesser degree trade name and developed technology we performed our impairment test considering the latest market conditions and expectations as well as lower anticipated revenue and profitability based on the nature of upis intangible assets we performed the recoverability test at the reporting unit 

level in connection with the recoverability test we reevaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets and determined the total undiscounted pretax cash flows generated by the reporting unit over the remaining useful life of the primary asset customer relationships the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the total undiscounted pretax cash flows and as a result the intangible assets were written down by 27 million  charged against cost of sales and service revenues within income from operations at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of legal proceedings before various courts and administrative agencies and are periodically subject to government examinations inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental liability accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of each of december 31 2017  and 2016  were 19 million  and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2017  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is 

greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income loss within general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  our cas costs in excess of fas expenses were 189 million  145 million  and 104 million  respectively 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to lower levels over the next few years the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act “hatfa” in 2014 and bba 2015 successively provided for the continuation of pension relief and higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phaseout period we consider the effects of pension relief legislation in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization 

was intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualifed for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflected the effects of the rule harmonization affected pension costs on contracts over a phasein period that ended in 2017 our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions noted above because of the method permitted under harmonization we use to determine the cas interest rate which is a current market rate 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event such as an amendment curtailment   or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 382  and 447  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 385  and 438  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 725  expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2017 pension expense and we anticipate retaining that assumption throughout 2018 

mortality   mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity   we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2017  the actual return on assets was approximately 170 which was greater than the expected return assumption of 725 for the year ended december 31 2017  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 65 and 53 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns updated mortality assumptions and discount rates resulted in actuarial gains of 473 million and 68 million and an actuarial loss of 625 million respectively as of december 31 2017  

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



assuming a 725 expected return on asset assumption a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 1 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost   in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond yields or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds since harmonization became fully phased in during 2017 the greater of the two liabilities is used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality corporate bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization prior to the full phasing in of harmonization the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities was required 

other fas and cas pension considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants under cas harmonization the amortization period changed from 15 to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustment in 2017  and 2016  was a net benefit of 189 million  and 145 million  respectively the favorable  change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization the fascas adjustment in 2015  was a net benefit of 104 million  the favorable change from 2015 to 2016 was driven by the continued phasein of harmonization our projected 2018 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate 

investment funds private partnerships collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive income  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2017  and 2016  were 1459 million  and 1583 million  respectively the decrease in these actuarial losses in 2017  was primarily driven by actual asset returns which were 473 million above expected returns 93 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses 68 million actuarial gain from updated mortality assumptions and a 625 million actuarial loss due to the decrease in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2017  and 2016  were 47 million  and 18 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the change in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2017  primarily resulted from amendments within a collective bargaining agreement offset by the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 235  and 254  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 48 million and 58 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 925 million  and 835 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 

2017   product sales in 2017   decreased   58 million  or 1  from 2016  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 10 million in 2017  primarily as a result of lower volumes in surface combatants partially offset by higher volumes in amphibious assault ships newport news product sales increased 20 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in aircraft carriers partially offset by lower volumes in submarines technical solutions 

product sales decreased 68 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in 2016 from the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

service revenues in 2017   increased   431 million  or 30  from 2016  service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 41 million in 2017  as a result of higher volumes in surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 57 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in naval nuclear support services and submarines services partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carriers services service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 333 million in 2017  primarily as a result of higher volumes in integrated missions solutions services following the december 2016 acquisition of camber and higher volumes in fleet support and oil and gas services 

2016   product sales in 2016   decreased   34 million  or 1  from 2015  product sales at our ingalls segment increased 138 million in 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes in surface combatants partially offset by lower volumes in the legend class nsc program newport news product sales decreased 275 million in 2016  primarily as a result of lower volumes in aircraft carriers technical solutions product sales increased 103 million in 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes in nuclear and environmental products

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2017   cost of product sales in 2017   increased   64 million  or 1  compared to 2016  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 64 million in 2017  primarily as a result of lower risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program following delivery of uss john p murtha  lpd 26 in 2016 as well as the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 56 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 partially offset by lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment decreased 56 million in 2017  primarily due to the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract partially offset by the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased  from 778  in 2016  to 797  in 2017  

primarily driven by lower risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program following delivery of uss john p murtha  lpd 26 in 2016 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers as well as the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 

2016   cost of product sales in 2016   increased   61 million  or 1  compared to 2015  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 194 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program cost of product sales at our newport news segment decreased 220 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 87 million in 2016  primarily due to the higher volumes described above cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased  from 762  in 2015  to 778  in 2016  primarily driven by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program 

cost of service revenues   

2017   cost of service revenues in 2017   increased   346 million  or 28  compared to 2016  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 23 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 30 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 293 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined  from 855  in 2016  to 843  in 2017  primarily driven by the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 improved performance in oil and gas services and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2016    cost of service revenues in 2016   increased   30 million  or 3  compared to 2015  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 66 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 32 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased 68 million in 2016  as a result of the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 and lower sales volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues decreased  from 884  in 2015  to 855  in 2016  primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 improved performance in fleet support services in 2016 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2017   income from operating investments net increased   6 million  or 100  to 12 million  in 2017  from 6 million  in 2016  the increase resulted from higher equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2016    income from operating investments net decreased   4 million  or 40  to 6 million  in 2016  from 10 million  in 2015  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

other income and gains 

2017   other income and gains decreased 15 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease resulted from state and local government grants at our newport news segment in 2016 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2017   general and administrative expenses in 2017   decreased   53 million  or 9  compared to 2016  this decrease was primarily driven by favorable changes in the fascas adjustment 

2016    general and administrative expenses in 2016   decreased   46 million  or 7  compared to 2015  this decrease was primarily driven by favorable changes in the fascas adjustment and lower current state tax expense 

impairment of goodwill 

as discussed above under critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

we recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015 of 75 million in our technical solutions segment see note 12 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to operating income 



segment operating income 

2017   segment operating income in 2017  was 688 million  compared to 715 million  in 2016  the decrease  was primarily due to lower risk retirement on the delivered uss john p murtha  lpd 26 lower volume and risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers favorable changes in overhead costs in 2016 the receipt in 2016 of a local government incentive grant and the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and portland  lpd 27 the resolution of 

outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and improved performance in oil and gas services 

2016   segment operating income in 2016  was 715 million  compared to 667 million  in 2015  the increase  was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the technical solutions segment in 2015 higher risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program favorable changes in overhead cost and the receipt of a local government incentive grant partially offset by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2017   the fascas adjustment in 2017  was a net benefit of 189 million  compared to a net benefit of 145 million  in 2016  the favorable  change was primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization 

2016   the fascas adjustment in 2016  was a net benefit of 145 million  compared to a net benefit of 104 million  in 2015  the favorable  change was primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2018  to be a net benefit of approximately 369 million 91 million fas and 460 million cas primarily driven by the more immediate recognition of the 2017 asset gains under fas and the impacts of lower discount and interest rates and other experience gains and losses and assumption changes eg mortality the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2018  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2017   noncurrent state income tax expense  in 2017  was 12 million  compared to 2 million  in 2016  deferred state income tax expense in 2017 was 12 million compared to deferred state income tax expense of 8 million in 2016 the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in pension related adjustments in 2017 the decrease in state uncertain tax positions resulted in a net tax benefit of less than 1 million compared to a tax benefit of 6 million in 2016 in 2016 a state uncertain tax position was settled through agreement with the applicable taxing authority and was partially offset by the recognition of a noncurrent state tax expense in a different jurisdiction impacted by the results of the settlement see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

2016   noncurrent state income tax expense  remained constant at 2 million  in 2016  and 2015  deferred state income tax expense in 2016 was 8 million as compared to deferred state income tax expense of less than 1 million in 2015 the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments in 2016 the decrease in state uncertain tax positions resulted in a net tax benefit of 6 million as compared to 2 million of tax expense in 2015 the state uncertain tax position was settled through agreement with the applicable taxing authority and was partially offset by 

the recognition of a noncurrent state tax expense in a different jurisdiction impacted by the results of the settlement see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

interest expense 

2017   interest expense in 2017  was 94 million  compared to 74 million  in 2016  the increase  was primarily a result of a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2017 see note 14 debt in item 8 

2016   interest expense in 2016  was 74 million  compared to 137 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily a result of refinancing 600 million principal amount of 7125 senior notes with 5000 senior notes and repayment in 2015 of credit facility term loans as well as the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015 see note 14 debt in item 8 

federal and foreign income taxes   

2017    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 380  in 2017  compared to 269  in 2016  the increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 was primarily attributable to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the decrease in the federal tax rate included in the tax act and a decrease in the domestic manufacturing deduction primarily resulting from an increase in the company’s 2018 expected discretionary pretax pension contributions see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

2016   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 269  in 2016  compared to 361  in 2015  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2016 was primarily attributable to the adoption of asu 201609 which reduced income tax expense by the income tax benefits resulting from stock award settlement activity a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions that resulted in a decrease in cumulative unrecognized tax benefits and the goodwill impairment that was recorded in 2015 see note 13 income taxes in item 8 

in december 2017 the us enacted the tax act which made significant changes to us federal income tax law including a reduction of the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 and changes or limitations to certain deductions as a result of the corporate income tax reduction effective january 1 2018 we revalued our net deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 this reduced our net deferred tax assets by 56 million which was recorded as additional income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 in future periods we expect that tax act changes will positively impact our aftertax earnings primarily due to the lower corporate income tax rate 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and technical solutions we established the technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with our acquisition of camber and realignment of management oversight of operations to enhance strategic and operational alignment among our services businesses as a result of this realignment our nonnuclear fleet support and nuclear and environmental services were transferred from our newport news segment to our technical solutions segment our oil and gas services were transferred from our other segment to our technical solutions segment and our other segment was dissolved 

in december 2016 we completed the acquisition of camber and in 2015 we completed the acquisition of usc we report the postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows of camber and usc as part of our technical solutions segment 

segment operating results are presented in the following table 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance such as the fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls 



sales and service revenues   

2017   ingalls revenues including intersegment sales increased   31 million  or 1  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily driven by higher revenues in amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues in surface combatants and the legend  class nsc program amphibious assault ships revenues increased as a result of higher volumes on bougainville lha 8 and fort lauderdale  lpd 28 partially offset by lower volume on the delivered uss john p murtha  lpd 26 and portland  lpd 27  surface combatants revenues decreased due to lower volumes on the delivered uss john finn  ddg 113 ralph johnson  ddg 114 frank e petersen jr ddg 121 paul ignatius  ddg 117 and delbert d black ddg 119 partially offset by higher volumes on lenah h sutcliffe higbee ddg 123 jack h lucas  ddg 125 and the extended selected restricted availability contract for uss ramage ddg 61 revenues on the legend class nsc program decreased due to lower volume on the delivered uscgc munro nsc 6 partially offset by higher volumes on stone  nsc 9 and midgett  nsc 8 

2016   ingalls revenues including intersegment sales increased   201 million  or 9  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily driven by higher revenues in surface combatants and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues in the legend class nsc program surface combatants revenues increased due to higher volumes on frank e petersen jr  ddg 121 lenah h sutcliffe higbee  ddg 123  and planning yard services partially offset by lower volume on john finn  ddg 113 in connection with its delivery in 2016 the increase in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to higher volumes on fort lauderdale lpd 28  tripoli  lha 7 and bougainville lha 8 partially offset by lower volumes on portland  lpd 27 and uss john p murtha  lpd 26 following its delivery in 2016  revenues on the legend class nsc program decreased due to delivery of uscgc  james nsc 5   in 2015 and lower volume on munro  nsc 6 partially offset by higher volume on midgett nsc 8 

segment operating income 

2017   ingalls operating income  in 2017  was 313 million  compared to income  of 321 million  in 2016  the decrease  was primarily due to lower risk retirement on the delivered uss john p murtha  lpd 26 and arleigh burke  class ddg 51 destroyers partially offset by higher risk retirement on tripoli  lha 7 and portland  lpd 27 

2016   ingalls operating income  in 2016  was 321 million  compared to income  of 379 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily due to the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement on the america class lha 6 program partially offset by higher risk retirement on uss john p murtha  lpd 26 portland  lpd 27 and ralph johnson ddg 114 

newport news 



sales and service revenues 

2017   newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased   75 million  or 2  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily driven by higher revenues in aircraft carriers and naval nuclear support services partially offset by lower revenues in submarines aircraft carriers revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the advance planning and execution contract for the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 the construction contract for john f kennedy cvn 79 and the advance planning contract for enterprise  cvn 80 partially offset by lower volumes on the execution contract for the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 the construction contract for the delivered uss gerald r ford  cvn 78  and the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 naval nuclear support services revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes in submarine support and facility maintenance services partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carrier support services submarines revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program decreased due to lower volumes on block iii boats partially offset by higher volumes on block iv boats 

  

2016   newport news revenues including intersegment sales decreased   209 million  or 5  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily driven by lower revenues in aircraft carriers aircraft carriers revenues decreased primarily as a 

result of lower volumes on uss gerald r ford cvn 78 and the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72   partially offset by higher volumes on john f kennedy  cvn 79 and the advance planning contract for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 submarines revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program were relatively constant in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher volumes on block iv boats and uss john warner  ssn 785 postshakedown availability services offset by lower volumes on block iii boats 

segment operating income 

2017   newport news operating income  in 2017  was 354 million  compared to income  of 386 million  in 2016  the decrease  was primarily due to lower volume and risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program favorable changes in overhead costs  in 2016 and the receipt in 2016 of a local government incentive grant partially offset by the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the inactivation of the decommissioned enterprise  cvn 65 and the rcoh of the redelivered uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 

2016   newport news operating income  in 2016  was 386 million  compared to income  of 401 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily due to lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and lower volume on uss gerald r ford  cvn 78 partially offset by favorable changes in overhead cost and higher volumes on john f kennedy  cvn 79 and the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 as well as the receipt of a local government incentive grant 

technical solutions 



sales and service revenues 

2017   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2017  increased   261 million  or 38  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher volume in integrated missions solutions services following the december 2016 acquisition of camber and higher volumes in fleet support and oil and gas services partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental volumes due to the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

2016   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2016  increased   75 million  or 12  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher nuclear and environmental and fleet support revenues as well as the acquisition of camber partially offset by lower revenues in oil and gas services nuclear and environmental revenues increased due to higher volumes and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a commercial contract partially offset by lower volumes associated with environmental remediation programs 

segment operating income 

2017   operating income  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2017  was 21 million  compared to operating income  of 8 million  in 2016 the increase  was primarily due to improved performance in oil and gas services and higher volume in integrated missions solutions services following the december 2016 acquisition of camber partially offset by the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017 and the resolution in 2016 of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

2016   operating income  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2016  was 8 million  compared to an operating loss  of 113 million  in 2015  the increase was primarily due to goodwill and 

intangible asset impairment charges in 2015 and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2017  was approximately 21 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2017  and 2016  



as a result of integration efforts following the acquisition of camber the company corrected the technical solutions segments total backlog and unfunded backlog as of december 31 2016 reducing the balances by 289 million 

we expect approximately 31  of the 21 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2017  to be converted into sales in 2018  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

awards 

2017   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2017  was approximately 81 billion significant new awards during this period included the detailed design and construction contract for bougainville  lha 8 and the execution contract for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 

2016   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2016  was approximately 52 billion significant new awards during this period included contracts for the detail design and construction of fort lauderdale  lpd 28 the construction of nsc 9 unnamed planning advanced engineering and procurement of longlead material for bougainville  lha 8 and additional advance planning for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2017   cash provided by  operating activities was 814 million  in 2017  compared to 822 million  in 2016  the decrease of 8 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to increased funding of retiree benefit plans and the change in deferred income taxes partially offset by a change in trade working capital the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by the timing of payments of accounts payable 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2018  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2016   cash provided by  operating activities was 822 million  in 2016  compared to 861 million  in 2015  the decrease of 39 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher funding of retiree benefit plans a change in trade working capital and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments respectively 

investing activities 

2017   cash used in  investing activities was 349 million  in 2017  a decrease  of 304 million  from 2016  the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of camber in 2016 partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017 

for 2018  we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 20 to 25 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 30 to 35 of annual revenues 

2016   cash used in  investing activities was 653 million  in 2016  an increase  of 512 million  from 2015  the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of camber in 2016 higher capital expenditures in 2016 the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015 and proceeds in 2015 from the aon litigation settlement 

financing activities 

2017   cash used in  financing activities in 2017  was 484 million  compared to 343 million   used in   2016  the change was primarily due to increases of 92 million of common stock repurchases 27 million of debt related expenditures 17 million of cash dividend payments and 5 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements 

2016   cash used in  financing activities in 2016  was 343 million  compared to 816 million   used in   2015  the change was primarily due to decreases of 449 million of debt related expenditures 38 million of common stock repurchases and 3 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by an additional 17 million of cash dividend payments in 2016 compared to 2015 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2017   free cash flow decreased 84 million  from 2016  primarily due to increased funding of retiree benefit plans higher capital expenditures and a change in trade working capital 

2016   free cash flow decreased 136 million  from 2015  primarily due to capital expenditures higher funding of retiree benefit plans a change in trade working capital and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded statuses we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 294 million  167 million  and 99 million  in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our qualified pension plans were funded 89 and 83 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2017  and 2016  these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations we expect our 2018  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 508 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 34 million  32 million  and 33 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect our 2018  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 35 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis

through our ingalls segment we design and construct nonnuclear ships for the us navy and us coast guard including amphibious assault ships surface combatants and national security cutters nscs we are the sole builder of amphibious assault ships and one of two builders of surface combatants for the us navy we are the sole builder of large multimission nscs for the us coast guard our ingalls segment is located in pascagoula mississippi on 800 acres along the pascagoula river this shipyard offers a collection of manufacturing capabilities that includes a 660ton gantry crane and a land based test facility 

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard avondale and consolidated that activity at our pascagoula mississippi facility which we believe has enhanced our competitive position by decreasing our fixed overhead expenses improving facility utilization to provide a more costefficient construction process centralizing our shipbuilding learning and increasing the benefits of serial production and reducing program costs in march 2015 we sold our gulfport composite center of excellence the gulfport facility in gulfport mississippi to the mississippi state port authority due to limited demand from the us navy for composite products provided by our gulfport facility 

amphibious assault ships 

  

we construct amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy which include the us navy large deck amphibious ships lha and amphibious transport dock ships lpd the lha is a key component of the us navymarine corps requirement for 11 expeditionary strike groupsamphibious readiness groups and design construction and modernization of lhas are core to our ingalls operations in 2007 we were awarded the construction contract for uss america lha 6 the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized marine assault platform we delivered uss america  lha 6 in the second quarter of 2014 are currently constructing tripoli lha 7 scheduled for delivery in 2018 and in 2016 were awarded the construction contract for bougainville lha 8

newport news 

the core business of our newport news segment nns is designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction refueling and complex overhaul and inactivation of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to newport news operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has designed and built more than 30 aircraft carriers for the us navy since 1933 including all ten nimitz class cvn 68 aircraft carriers currently in active service 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier and the last of the nimitz class cvn 68 uss george hw bush cvn 77 in 2009 we have been engaged in design work and construction on the next generation gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier for over ten years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class gerald r ford  cvn 78 which is scheduled for delivery in 2017 we also received awards in 2009 through 2016 totaling 76 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier john f kennedy  cvn 79 we have also received awards totaling 152 million for advance planning and longlead time material acquisition for the third gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carrier enterprise cvn 80 

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes nearly four years to complete with the work accounting for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and fleet support across the globe 

we have received cumulative awards to date totaling 26 billion under an execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72  which is scheduled for redelivery in 2017 we are currently performing under a planning contract for the rcoh of uss george washington cvn 73 we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our rcoh performance on the first four nimitz class cvn 68 

carriers and our highly trained workforce as well as the fact that rcoh work is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for rcoh contract awards on the remaining nimitz class cvn 68 carriers as well as future work on gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers 

the us navy awarded us a 745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate uss enterprise cvn 65 the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 uss enterprise cvn 65 has a scheduled redelivery date in 2017 for final dismantlement aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten nimitz class cvn 68 carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as gerald r ford class cvn 78 aircraft carriers we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans we believe we are well positioned as the us navys shipyard of choice for these contract awards 

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 59  submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 45  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 52 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 25 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government receives nonexclusive licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our total backlog was approximately 21 billion  and 22 billion  respectively we expect approximately 30  of backlog at december 31 2016  to be converted into sales in 2017  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing while we have not generally been 

dependent upon any one supply source we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations to facilitate innovative product development and evolution our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 19 million  for each of the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  and 18 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it includes a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risk factors in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies evaluate our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we modify our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for convenience contractors are normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contracts and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those related to procurement our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas 

which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we prepare submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all allowable costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our business our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal acquisition regulation far the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding longterm contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in our markets because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and inactivating the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities if a us government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our market position could be significantly and adversely affected 

although we recently competed with another large defense contractor for the first time to construct a large deck amphibious ship which was awarded to us we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard and well positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to a longterm teaming agreement with the other company for the production of such vessels we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyers and are well positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we would record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2016  our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately 1 million  which were accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur additional environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of shipbuilding at avondale any additional costs are not reasonably estimable at this time due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly such potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 1 million  accrual for environmental remediation costs or our 276 million  estimate of avondale restructuring costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant portion of any future environmental remediation costs we might incur at avondale would be recoverable in accordance with government accounting practices under the far 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws but we expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industries according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced one industrial related fatality in the past seven years we strive to keep our occupational safety and health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program 

osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work our cmsd facility has also been certified as an osha vpp star site 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe each regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 37000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 5000 engineers and designers and approximately 2500 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1000 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2016  there were 911 master shipbuilders at newport news and 298 at ingalls we employ more than 5500 veterans across the enterprise 

more than 1600 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding units each year in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 4500 apprentice alumni 3000 at newport news and 1500 at ingalls continue to work with us 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three  collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees one of which covers approximately 50 of newport news employees and expires in july 2017 the remaining two collective bargaining agreements at newport news expire in august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement newport news is currently negotiating with the international association of machinist and aerospace workers iam which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 newport news radiological control calibration and laboratory technicians ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2018 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues in 2016  were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition most of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2016  our us government contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the us navy and the us coast guard the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for recovery of those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process in continuing resolutions or in individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded   representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 but sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 longterm uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

  

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding 

programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2016 our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 31 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes in customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us governments convenience contractors are normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contracts and receive profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating contract costs reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which cost overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us government and us the us government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a contract formula that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls revenues in 2016  approximately 91  were generated from fpi contracts approximately 5  were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 2  were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 2  were generated from ffp contracts of newport news 2016  revenues approximately 39  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 38  were generated from fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction contracts approximately 22  were generated from cpif contracts consisting primarily of aircraft carrier construction and rcoh contracts and approximately 1  were generated from ffp contracts of technical solutions revenues in 2016  approximately 34  were generated from time and material contracts approximately 26  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 26  were generated from ffp contracts approximately 10  were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 3  were generated from fpi contracts and approximately 1  were generated from cpif contracts to the extent our mix of contract types changes in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts could be negatively affected 

  

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform under contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from our assumptions or projections or if we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on third parties to provide raw materials and major components and subsystems for our products and to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers and to do so in compliance with applicable laws and regulations disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely compliant and costeffective manner or otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements the inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate parties which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain raw materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer in some cases only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part in a timely compliant or costeffective manner could affect our ability to perform our contract 

our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized or noncompliant parts and materials we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding the parts and materials we procure from them and in some circumstances we rely on certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving parts and materials that fail to meet specifications subcontractors and suppliers have in the past provided us with noncompliant parts and materials 

our inability to procure or significant delay in acquiring necessary raw materials components or parts the failure of our subcontractors or suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations inaccurate certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance or noncompliant materials components or parts we acquire from our subcontractors and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

the defense industry has experienced and we expect will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from an increased focus by dod on affordability efficiencies business systems recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the dods initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on our current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod in addition to dods business practice iniatives the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits in addition the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and other thresholds are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

  

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and workers with the necessary skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts and attracting new contract awards 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict the reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy as evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 274 ships as of december 31 2016 has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which we own plus many other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and submarines we also recently competed with the same contractor for the first time to build a large deck amphibious ship which was awarded to us we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build other ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and other amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience lower revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards currently engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of los angeles class ssn 688 submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships if a us governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk that we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement cyber security and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and risks and change on a consistent basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to recovery of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and reduce our profitability 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes relative to us government requirements if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we will modify our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns     

  

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards and we are subject from time to time to us government investigations relating to our operations if we are convicted or otherwise found to have engaged in illegal activities or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in contract values contract modifications 

or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities or stateoftheart manufacturing expertise include technological complexity or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually include new technology that is supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule for construction the risks associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues can and have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may not recover all of our costs related to the wind down of shipbuilding at our avondale shipyard 

  

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard and consolidated all ingalls shipbuilding into our pascagoula shipyard in connection with and as a result of the wind down of shipbuilding at avondale we have incurred substantial restructuring costs and asset writedowns which we currently estimate at 276 million  we have engaged in communications and negotiations with the us navy since 2010 regarding the amount and recovery of our restructuring and shutdown costs in june 2016 we filed a request with the contracting officer seeking a final decision regarding our recovery of the avondale restructuring and shutdown costs in december 2016 the contracting officer denied our claim on the purported basis that we had not adequately shown savings and other benefits that would accrue to the us government from the closing of avondale and consolidation of ingalls shipbuilding to the pascagoula facility while we intend to pursue our claim pursuant to the contract disputes act any inability to recover our restructuring expenses substantially in accordance with our cost recovery expectations could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to restructuring costs and asset writedowns associated with winding down shipbuilding operations at avondale we may incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down such costs which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time could be significant the actual restructuring expenses we have and may incur in the future in connection with our wind down of avondale including potential environmental costs may be greater than our current estimate 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our assumptions on ship contracts include the length of time to complete the contract because total costs include expected increases in wages and material prices similarly our assumptions include the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts we consider incentives awards and penalties related to contract performance when we estimate revenues and profit rates and we record them when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance 

the judgment and estimation processes described above are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant natural disasters can disrupt our facilities systems or projects which can interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the types of events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to negotiate and enter into insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks 

the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees one of which covers approximately 50 of newport news employees and expires in july 2017 the remaining two collective bargaining agreements at newport news expire in august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement newport news is currently negotiating with iam which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 newport news radiological control calibration and laboratory technicians ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2018 approximately 35 technical solutions craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and we negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our earnings equity and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm returns on assets will result in future changes in pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding of the plans 

timing differences exist among the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap pension funding requirements and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards cas board issued its final cas harmonization rule the rule impacted pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and was effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we have incurred and expect to incur in the future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we ceased shipbuilding construction at our avondale louisiana shipyard in 2014 our wind down of operations at this shipyard may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial agreements 

  

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we also access these markets to obtain credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and arrange for letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may 

adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual or financing commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers and subcontractors ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers or subcontractors ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets including brokers and dealers commercial banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be liquidated upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us under the related contract 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we may not however prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors and the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents business partners and others working on our behalf including suppliers and subcontractors could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational harm 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our suppliers subcontractors and other business partners face cyber security and other security threats although we work cooperatively with our customers suppliers subcontractors and other business partners to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats other security threats or business disruptions we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities which may affect the security of our information these entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with us government contractors may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber security threats we face 

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments to determine acquisition prices which prices are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as of december 31 2016  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 19  and 9  respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 the second quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded goodwill impairment charges at our technical solutions segment of 16 million  59 million  and 47 million  respectively the oil and gas reporting unit within our technical solutions segment is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry the goodwill impairment charges were primarily driven by continuing declines in oil prices and the resulting decreases in industry market multiples in the fourth quarter of 2015 we also recorded an intangible asset impairment of 27 million  at our technical solutions segment as a result of declining market conditions and updated expectations 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business the ultimate tax determination of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period 

changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability both the incoming administration and the new congress have offered plans to reform the federal income tax code along with other significant policy initiatives some of which could have a material impact on the company 

in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

as part of our business strategy we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of business opportunities in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges unexpected liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and charges for impairments of purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are subject to various administrative civil and criminal litigation environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property related to our business and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally receives nonexclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of us government contracts and the us government may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property more recently the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2016 we had 1278 million of debt under senior notes and 1225 million of additional borrowing capacity under our second amended and restated credit agreement the “amended credit facility” our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 

because we use a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our various debt arrangements moreover we have significant additional borrowing capacity and may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

restrictive covenants in the indentures governing our senior notes and our amended credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the terms of our amended credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 

in addition the terms of our amended credit facility require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio 

the indentures governing our two tranches of 5000 senior notes limit our ability among other things to 

 

these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit our strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes these covenants may affect how we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs these covenants may therefore affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently provide for a partially classified board of directors require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy consequently the us navy requires us to include in our contracts with the navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear operations for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

we believe that our physical facilities and equipment are generally well maintained in good operating condition and satisfactory for our current needs while our physical facilities and equipment are adequate for our current needs we have initiated capital expenditure programs at our ingalls and newport news segments that will make us more competitive and enable us to meet future obligations under our shipbuilding programs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on navy and coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we provided information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million  in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy has reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million  to 47 million  while expressing its view that the gross amount of potential mischarging incurred by the navy will likely not exceed 31 million  the us coast guard informed us in june 2014 that it was provisionally reducing its withhold from 58 million  to 36 million  based on the results of our internal investigation we estimate that the maximum amount of us navy and coast guard mischarging is approximately 4 million  we are continuing discussions with our us government customers regarding the potential release of an additional portion of the withheld funds but we cannot predict whether or when these customers will agree to any additional release of the withhold amounts 

in june 2015 the doj informed us that it is investigating the matters we disclosed to the dod in january 2013 in july 2015 the doj requested information from us and we are cooperating with the doj’s requests and have provided certain information to the doj depending upon the outcome of this matter we could be subject to civil penalties damages andor suspension or debarment from future us government contracts which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows given the current stage of our discussions with the doj we are currently unable to estimate the ultimate outcome of this matter 

litigation  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business although we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters 

  

in january 2011 the us department of justice doj first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint we received alleged that through largely unspecified fraudulent means we and northrop grumman obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to katrina and for which we and northrop grumman were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint sought monetary damages of at least 835 million  plus penalties attorneys fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

  

in july 2012 the district court entered an order permitting us to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint received by us including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the doj to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes in december 2011 the doj filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case in february 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia granted the defendants motion to transfer venue and the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of mississippi we filed a motion to dismiss the case and a motion to disqualify relator holmes and all other matters were stayed pending resolution of those motions in june 2015 the district court granted our motion to disqualify holmes as relator dismissed the case as to holmes and entered final judgment in favor of us holmes appealed the district courts decision to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit and in march 2016 the court of appeals affirmed the district courts decision holmes filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court of the united states seeking review of the fifth circuit decision that petition was denied in october 2016 and the matter is now concluded 

in 2015 we received a civil investigative demand from the doj relating to an investigation of certain allegedly nonconforming parts we purchased from one of our suppliers for use in connection with us government contracts we have cooperated with the doj in connection with its investigation in 2016 we were made aware that we are a defendant in a false claims act lawsuit filed under seal in the us district court for the middle district of florida related to our purchase of the allegedly nonconforming parts from the supplier depending upon the outcome of this matter we could be subject to civil penalties damages andor suspension or debarment from future us government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the matter remains sealed and given the current posture of the matter we are unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss or to express an opinion regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of current cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation 

we and our predecessorininterest have been in litigation with the bolivarian republic of venezuela the “republic” since 2002 over a contract for the repair refurbishment and modernization at ingalls of two foreignbuilt frigates the case proceeded towards arbitration then appeared to settle favorably but the settlement was overturned in court and the matter returned to litigation in march 2014 we filed an arbitral statement of claim asserting breaches of the contract and 173 million  in damages plus substantial interest and litigation expenses in july 2014 the republic filed in the arbitration a statement of defense denying all our allegations and a counterclaim alleging late redelivery of the frigates unfinished work and breach of warranty and asserting damages of 61 million  plus interest an arbitration hearing was held in january 2015 and we cannot predict when the arbitration panel will render a decision no assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our business 

huntington ingalls industries inc is america’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry for more than a century our ingalls and newport news segments in mississippi and virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other us naval shipbuilder our technical solutions segment provides a wide range of professional services including fleet support integrated missions solutions nuclear and environmental and oil and gas services headquartered in newport news virginia hii employs approximately 37000  people operating both domestically and internationally 

we conduct most of our business with the us government principally the dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs ingalls includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses newport news includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses we also provide a range of services to the governmental energy and oil and gas markets through our technical solutions segment 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the bca established limits on us government discretionary spending including a reduction of defense spending by approximately 487 billion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021 the bca also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional 500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 but sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 longterm uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that us government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure despite the presidents recent executive order indicating the new administrations desire to increase investment in readiness and modernization 

we cannot predict the impact that sequestration cuts or reprioritization of readiness and modernization investment may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition spending cuts andor reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures that result from sequestration will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress and the new administration continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations and peacekeeping we believe the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in march 2014 the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr built upon the 2012 defense strategic guidance prioritizing three strategic pillars defending the homeland building security globally by projecting us influence and deterring aggression and remaining prepared to win decisively against any adversary should deterrence fail guided by this updated defense strategy dod plans to rebalance the military over the next decade and put it on a sustainable path to protect and advance us interests and sustain us global leadership the new administration has also announced that it intends to undertake a review to assess readiness conditions including training equipment maintenance munitions modernization and infrastructure to guide the development of a budget amendment for fiscal year 2017 as well as budget requests for fiscals years 2018 and 2019 

we expect that the dod execution of its strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while still facing additional budget cuts from sequestration while the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for 2018 and beyond bca spending caps could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in july 2016 the us navy released its 2017 shipbuilding plan the 2017 plan which anticipates a fleet of 308 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 34 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 34 support vessels the 2017 plan also notes that the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps have determined that the force structure required to support a 20 marine expeditionary brigade assault echelon is 38 amphibious ships but due to budget pressures the 2017 plan only supported an inventory of 34 active amphibious ships the 2017 plan also emphasized the requirement to replace submarines of the ohio  class as they retire this would require that the lead columbia  class ssbn 826 submarine be purchased in fiscal year 2021 with the second ship of the class to be purchased in fiscal year 2024 followed by funding of one columbia  class ssbn 826 submarine each year between 2026 and 2035 

in december 2016 the us navy released the findings of a yearlong force structure assessment that was developed to determine the right balance of existing forces the ships currently under construction and the future procurement plans needed to address the everevolving and increasingly complex threats that the navy is required to counter notably the force structure assessment did not present a desired force size the us navy would pursue if resources were not constrained it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success accordingly the force structure assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships comprised of 12 aircraft carriers 104 large surface combatants 52 small surface combatants 38 amphibious warfare ships 66 attack submarines 12 ballistic missile submarines 32 combat logistics ships 10 expeditionaryhigh speed transports 6 expeditionary support bases and 23 command and support ships it remains unclear whether the 2016 force structure assessment will have any bearing on the outcome of the new administration’s assessment of readiness conditions including training equipment maintenance munitions modernization and infrastructure that will guide the development of a budget amendment for fiscal year 2017 as well as budget requests for fiscals years 2018 and 2019 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single 

customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys littoral combat ship the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control the most recent initiatives included in the september 2014 bbp 30 are organized into eight major areas achieve affordable programs achieve dominant capabilities while controlling lifecycle costs incentivize productivity in industry and government incentivize innovation in industry and government eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy promote effective competition improve tradecraft in acquisition of services and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce while the impact to our business resulting from these initiatives remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risk factors in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we have other types of contracts such as services and commercial arrangements for which revenues are recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured costs related to these contracts are expensed as incurred we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2016  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on uss john p murtha  lpd 26 the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program portland lpd 27 the legend class nsc program and the arleigh burke class ddg 51 destroyer program during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln cvn 72 and construction of gerald r ford  cvn 78 as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend class nsc program and the san antonio class lpd 17 program including delivered ships the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the america class lha 6 program and the rcoh of uss theodore roosevelt  cvn 71 and contract impacts of the aon litigation settlement during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on gerald r ford  cvn 78  as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program the legend class nsc program the  san antonio class lpd 17 program including delivered lpd ships and the construction contract for gerald r ford  cvn 78 during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was 1234 million  and 956 million  respectively 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2016  impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2016 

in conjunction with the realignment of our operations on december 1 2016 we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair values of the reporting units being realigned as a result during the fourth quarter of 2016 we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately after the realignment for each of the reporting units impacted by our realignment based on this quantitative assessment no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment 

november 30 2015 and december 31 2015 impairment tests  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2015 and while the annual impairment test did not result in an impairment considering the limited excess fair value of goodwill over its carrying value in our oil and gas reporting unit and the continued decline in oil prices and related industry activity levels we performed an interim assessment of goodwill as of december 31 2015 our determination of fair value as of december 31 2015 considered industry events that occurred in the period since our annual goodwill impairment test as well as the updated long term outlook for this reporting unit those events included continued deterioration in the oil and gas markets numerous industrywide project deferrals and capital spending cuts announced by industry leaders the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of december 31 2015 and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 16 million  at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2015 

may 31 2015 impairment test  we continuously monitor industry events and changes in circumstances in the industries in which our reporting units conduct business in consideration of the oil and gas reporting unit’s sensitivity to developments within its industry the continued decline in crude oil prices significant reductions in its customer capital spending plans and project delays we concluded an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our oil and gas reporting unit was still higher than its carrying value as of may 31 2015 our assessment considered the aforementioned changes to expectations that were considered as part of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2014 as a result of our analysis we recorded a 59 million  goodwill impairment charge at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the second quarter of 2015 

november 30 2014 impairment test  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2014 and determined that goodwill at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment was 

impaired by 47 million  the goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by the drop in oil prices and the resulting decrease in industry market multiples we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2014 

other intangible assets   we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

december 31 2015 impairment test   we performed an impairment test as of december 31 2015 on the amortizable intangible assets that arose from the upi acquisition which reside in our oil and gas reporting unit within our technical solutions segment the oil and gas asset group’s longlived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and to a lesser degree trade name and developed technology we performed our impairment test considering the latest market conditions and expectations as well as lower anticipated revenue and profitability based on the nature of upis intangible assets we performed the recoverability test at the reporting unit level in connection with the recoverability test we reevaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets and determined the total undiscounted pretax cash flows generated by the reporting unit over the remaining useful life of the primary asset customer relationships the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the total undiscounted pretax cash flows and as a result the intangible assets were written down by 27 million  charged against cost of sales and service revenues within income from operations at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were 19 million  and 18 million  respectively and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2016  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business 

operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income loss within general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  our cas costs in excess of fas expenses were 145 million  104 million  and 72 million  respectively 

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to 

lower levels over the next few years the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act “hatfa” in 2014 and bba 2015 successively provided for the continuation of higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phaseout period we consider the effects of legislation such as map21 hatfa and bba 2015 in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflect the effects of the rule harmonization affects pension costs on contracts over a phasein period ending in 2017 our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions offered under map21 hatfa and bba 2015 because of the method permitted under harmonization we use to determine the cas interest rate which is a current market rate 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event such as an amendment curtailment   or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 447  and 473  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 438  and 458  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 750  expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2016 and 2015 pension expense our 2017 expected longterm rate of return assumption is 725  a decrease of 025  from 2016 based on our updated view of portfolio and market expectations 

mortality   mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity   we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions might be affected 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2016  the actual return on assets was approximately 69 which was less than the expected return assumption of 75 for the year ended december 31 2016  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 26 and 20 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of 25 million and an actuarial loss of 241 million respectively as of december 31 2016  

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



assuming a 725 expected return on asset assumption a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost   in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality bonds when harmonization is fully phased in the greater of the two liabilities will be used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization the four year phase in period that will be completed in 2017 requires the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities 

other fas and cas pension considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the employees average future service life of approximately 12 years under cas actuarial gains and losses were amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under harmonization the amortization period for cas changed to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustment in 2016  and 2015  was a net benefit of 145 million  and 104 million  respectively the favorable  change was primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization the fascas adjustment in 2014 was a net benefit of 72 million  the favorable change from 2014 to 2015 was driven by the phasein of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 our projected 2017 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive income  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were 1583 million  and 1412 million  respectively the increase in these actuarial losses in 2016  was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations which accounted for 241 million and by 2016 actual asset returns being less than expected by 25 million and 78 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were 18 million  and 19 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2016  primarily resulted from amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 254  and 212  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 46 million and 56 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 835 million  and 825 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the following table 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues were comprised as follows 

2016   product sales in 2016   decreased   34 million  or 1  from 2015  product sales at our ingalls segment increased 138 million in 2016  primarily as a result of higher volumes in surface combatants partially offset by lower volumes in the legend class nsc program newport news product sales decreased 275 million in 2016

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2016   cost of product sales in 2016   increased   61 million  or 1  compared to 2015  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased 194 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and the volume changes described above partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program cost of product sales at our newport news segment decreased 220 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the volume changes described above partially offset by lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 87 million in 2016  primarily due to the higher volumes described above cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased  from 762  in 2015  to 778  in 2016  primarily driven by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class lpd 17 program 

2015   cost of product sales in 2015   decreased   170 million  or 4  compared to 2014  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 225 million in 2015  primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation and the lower sales volumes described above cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 34 million in 2015  primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above and yeartoyear variances in contract mix cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased 21 million in 2015  primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased  from 786  in 2014  to 762  in 2015  primarily driven by the settlement of the aon litigation higher performance in amphibious assault ships and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by lower performance in aircraft carriers 

cost of service revenues   

2016   cost of service revenues in 2016   increased   30 million  or 3  compared to 2015  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 66 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 32 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased 68 million in 2016  as a result of the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 and the lower sales volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined  from 884  in 2015  to 855  in 2016  primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 improved performance in fleet support services in 2016 and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2015    cost of service revenues in 2015   increased   147 million  or 14  compared to 2014  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 15 million in 2015  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 119 million in 2015  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased 13 million in 2015  primarily as a result of the intangible asset impairment charge partially offset by the lower sales volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased  from 844  in 2014  to 884  in 2015  primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment charge and lower performance in oil and gas services as well as lower performance in aircraft carriers services and yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2016   income from operating investments net decreased   4 million  or 40  to 6 million  in 2016  from 10 million  in 2015  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2015    income from operating investments net decreased   1 million  or 9  to 10 million  in 2015  from 11 million  in 2014  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

other income and gains 

2016   other income and gains increased 15 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase resulted from state and local government grants at our newport news segment 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2016   general and administrative expenses in 2016   decreased   46 million  or 7  compared to 2015  this decrease was primarily driven by favorable changes in the fascas adjustment and lower current state tax expense 

2015    general and administrative expenses in 2015   decreased   57 million  or 8  compared to 2014  this decrease was primarily the result of a favorable change in the fascas adjustment and lower overhead costs offset by the inclusion of upi and higher state tax expense 

impairment of goodwill 

as discussed above under critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

we recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015  and 2014  of 75 million  and 47 million  respectively in our technical solutions segment see note 12 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance because neither is an allowable cost under our us government contracts segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to operating income 



segment operating income 

2016   segment operating income in 2016  was 715 million  compared to 667 million  in 2015  the increase  was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the technical solutions segment in 2015 higher risk retirement on the san antonio class lpd 17 program favorable changes in overhead cost and the receipt of a local government incentive grant partially offset by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 

2015   segment operating income in 2015  was 667 million  compared to 585 million  in 2014  the increase  was primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation higher performance and volumes in submarines and higher performance on amphibious assault ships partially offset by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the technical solutions segment and lower performance on aircraft carriers 

activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2016   the fascas adjustment in 2016  was a net benefit of 145 million  compared to a net benefit of 104 million  in 2015  the favorable  change was primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization 

2015   the fascas adjustment in 2015  was a net benefit of 104 million  compared to a net benefit of 72 million  in 2014  the favorable  change was driven by the phasein of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2017  to be a net benefit of approximately 198 million 167 million fas and 365 million cas primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2017  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year 

noncurrent state income taxes 

noncurrent state income taxes include deferred state income taxes which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2016   noncurrent state income tax expense  remained constant at 2 million  in 2016  and 2015  deferred state income tax expense in 2016 was 8 million as compared to deferred state income tax expense of less than 1 million in 2015 the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments in 2016 the decrease in state uncertain tax positions resulted in a net tax benefit of 6 million as compared to 2 million of tax expense in 2015 the state uncertain tax position was settled through agreement with the applicable taxing authority and was partially offset by the recognition of a noncurrent state tax expense in a different jurisdiction impacted by the results of the settlement see note 13 income taxes 

2015   the noncurrent state income tax expense  remained constant at 2 million  in 2015  and 2014  noncurrent state income tax expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards 

interest expense 

2016   interest expense in 2016  was 74 million  compared to 137 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily a result of refinancing 600 million principal amount of 7125 senior notes with 5000 senior notes and repayment in 2015 of credit facility term loans as well as the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015 see note 14 debt in item 8 

2015   interest expense in 2015  was 137 million  compared to 149 million  in 2014  the decrease  was primarily a result of refinancing 600 million principal amount of 6875 senior notes with 5000 senior notes and repayment in full of the term loans partially offset by loss on early extinguishment of debt see note 14 debt in item 8 

federal and foreign income taxes   

2016    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 269  in 2016  compared to 361  in 2015  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2016 was primarily attributable to the adoption of asu 201609 which reduced income tax expense by the income tax benefits resulting from stock award settlement activity a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions that resulted in a decrease in cumulative unrecognized tax benefits and the goodwill impairment that was recorded in 2015 see note 13 income taxes 

2015   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 361  in 2015  compared to 333  in 2014  the increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily attributable to adjustments to the domestic manufacturing deduction and an increase in the goodwill impairment that is not amortizable for tax purposes 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and technical solutions we established the technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with our acquisition of camber and realignment of management oversight of operations to enhance strategic and operational alignment among our services businesses as a result of this realignment our nonnuclear fleet support and nuclear and environmental services were transferred from our newport news segment to our technical solutions segment our oil and gas services were transferred from our other segment to our technical solutions segment and our other segment was dissolved we have reflected the 2016 realignment in prior reporting periods on a retrospective basis which has resulted in the transfer of revenue operating profit assets and liabilities between our technical solutions newport news and other segments none of these changes impacted our previously reported consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on december 1 2016 we completed the acquisition of camber in 2015 we completed the acquisition of usg and in 2014 we completed the acquisitions of upi and sn3 we report the postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows of camber usg upi and sn3 as part of our technical solutions segment 

segment operating results are presented in the following table 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the fascas adjustment and noncurrent state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls 



sales and service revenues

segment operating income 

2016   ingalls operating income  in 2016  was 321 million  compared to income  of 379 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily due to the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement on the america class lha 6 program partially offset by higher risk retirement on uss john p murtha  lpd 26 portland  lpd 27 and ralph johnson ddg 114

newport news 



sales and service revenues 

2016   newport news revenues including intersegment sales decreased   209 million  or 5  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily driven by lower revenues in aircraft carriers aircraft carriers revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes on gerald r ford cvn 78 and the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72   partially offset by higher volumes on john f kennedy  cvn 79 and the advance planning contract for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 submarines revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program were relatively constant in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher volumes on block iv boats and uss john warner  ssn 785 postshakedown availability services offset by lower volumes on block iii boats 

  

2015   newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased   172 million  or 4  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily driven by higher revenues in submarines and naval nuclear support services partially offset by lower revenues in aircraft carriers submarines revenues related to the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program were higher due to higher volumes on block iv boats partially offset by lower volumes on block iii boats higher revenues in naval nuclear support services were primarily due to higher volumes associated with aircraft carrier support services aircraft carrier revenues decreased due to lower volumes on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and the construction contract for gerald r ford cvn 78   partially offset by higher volume on the construction contract for john f kennedy cvn 79  

segment operating income 

2016   newport news operating income  in 2016  was 386 million  compared to income  of 401 million  in 2015  the decrease  was primarily due to lower risk retirement in the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln  cvn 72 and lower volume on gerald r ford  cvn 78 partially offset by favorable changes in overhead cost and higher volumes on john f kennedy  cvn 79 and the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73 as well as the receipt of a local government incentive grant 

2015   newport news operating income  in 2015  was 401 million  compared to income  of 389 million  in 2014  the increase  was due to higher volumes and performance on the virginia class ssn 774 submarine program and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of uss theodore roosevelt  cvn 71 partially offset by lower performance on the construction contract for gerald r ford  cvn 78 and lower volumes in aircraft carriers rcoh programs 

technical solutions 



sales and service revenues 

2016   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2016  increased   75 million  or 12  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher nuclear and environmental and fleet support revenues as well as the acquisition of camber partially offset by lower revenues in oil and gas services nuclear and environmental revenues increased due to higher volumes and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a commercial contract partially offset by lower volumes associated with environmental remediation programs 

2015   technical solutions revenues including intersegment sales for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased   11 million  or 2  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower nuclear and environmental and oil and gas revenues partially offset by higher fleet support revenues 

segment operating income 

2016   operating income  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2016  was 8 million  compared to an operating loss  of 113 million  in 2015 the increase  was primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2015 and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract 

2015   operating loss  in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31 2015  was 113 million  compared to an operating loss  of 33 million  in 2014  the increase d loss was primarily due to higher goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2015 and lower performance in oil and gas services 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2016  was approximately 21 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2016  and 2015  



we expect approximately 30  of the 21 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2016  to be converted into sales in 2017  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

awards 

2016   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2016  was approximately 52 billion significant new awards during this period included contracts for the detail design and construction of fort lauderdale  lpd 28 the construction of nsc 9 unnamed planning advanced engineering and procurement of longlead material for bougainville  lha 8 and additional advance planning for the rcoh of uss george washington  cvn 73

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses implementing our business strategy and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

we elected to early adopt asu 201609 as of january 1 2016 accordingly income tax benefits resulting from stock award settlement activity were reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows prior year tax benefits were retrospectively adjusted in our consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation in accordance with the new standard we will continue to present all cash payments made to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for withheld shares as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2016   cash provided by  operating activities was 822 million  in 2016  compared to 861 million  in 2015  the decrease of 39 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher funding of retiree benefit plans a change in trade working capital and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments respectively 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2017  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2015   cash provided by  operating activities was 861 million  in 2015  compared to 755 million  in 2014  the favorable change of 106 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans partially offset by higher payments for income taxes and a change in trade working capital the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments respectively 

investing activities 

2016   cash used in  investing activities was 653 million  in 2016  an increase  of 512 million  from 2015  the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of camber in 2016 higher capital expenditures in 2016 the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015 and proceeds in 2015 from the aon litigation settlement 

for 2017  we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 20 to 25 of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 25 to 30 of annual revenues 

2015   cash used in  investing activities was 141 million  in 2015  a decrease  of 296 million  from 2014  the favorable change in investing cash flow was driven by the 2014 acquisitions of upi and sn3 the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015 and proceeds from the aon litigation settlement 

financing activities 

2016   cash used in  financing activities in 2016  was 343 million  compared to 816 million   used in   2015  the change was primarily due to decreases of 449 million of debt related expenditures 38 million of common stock repurchases and 3 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by an additional 17 million of cash dividend payments in 2016  compared to 2015  

2015   cash used in  financing activities in 2015  was 816 million  compared to 371 million   used in   2014  the increase was primarily due to an additional 316 million of longterm debt repayment 94 million of repurchases of common stock 32 million of cash dividend payments 11 million of debt related expenditures as well as a 6 million decrease in excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation and a 2 million decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2016   free cash flow decreased 136 million  from 2015  primarily due to capital expenditures higher funding of retiree benefit plans a change in trade working capital and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation 

2015   free cash flow increased 83 million  from 2014  primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans partially offset by higher payments for income taxes capital expenditures and a change in trade working capital 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded statuses if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions could be affected we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 167 million  99 million  and 123 million  in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our qualified pension plans were funded 83 and 84 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2016  and 2015  these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to develop respective obligations for these two different purposes we expect our 2017  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 290 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 32 million  33 million  and 33 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we expect our 2017  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 37 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are 

not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis 

other sources and uses of capital

 item 1 business 

history and organization 

for more than a century huntington ingalls industries inc hii the company we us or our and as the context requires including our predecessor business as a subsidiary of northrop grumman corporation northrop grumman has been designing building overhauling and repairing ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard we are the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers a builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters nscs for the us coast guard one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and one of only two companies that builds the navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers we are the exclusive provider of refueling and complex overhaul rcoh services for nuclearpowered aircraft carriers a fullservice systems provider for the design engineering construction and life cycle support of major programs for surface ships and a provider of fleet support and maintenance services for the us navy 

  

we conduct most of our business with the us government principally the department of defense dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs we operate our shipbuilding business through our huntington ingalls incorporated subsidiary which is organized into two segments ingalls shipbuilding ingalls which includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses and newport news shipbuilding newport news which includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses we also provide a range of services to the energy and oil and gas industries as well as government customers 

  

we became an independent publiclyowned company on march 31 2011 when we were spun off from northrop grumman we have owned and operated the legacy northrop grumman shipbuilding business since the spinoff we believe our product capabilities heavy industrial facilities and a workforce of approximately 36000  employees position us well to continue to support the longterm objectives of the us navy and us coast guard 

ingalls 

  

through our ingalls segment we design and construct nonnuclear ships for the us navy and us coast guard including amphibious assault ships surface combatants and nscs we build amphibious assault ships for the us navy and have built 28 of the 62 ddg51 arleigh burke class of aegis guided missile destroyers in active service we are also the sole builder of the large multimission nscs for the us coast guard our ingalls shipbuilding site is located in pascagoula mississippi this shipyard offers a collection of manufacturing capabilities that include a 660ton gantry crane and a land based test facility 

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard avondale and consolidated that activity at our pascagoula mississippi facility which we believe enhances our competitive position by decreasing our fixed overhead expenses improving facility utilization to provide a more costefficient construction process centralizing our shipbuilding learning and increasing the benefits of serial production and reducing program costs in march 2015 we sold our gulfport composite center of excellence the gulfport facility in gulfport mississippi to the mississippi state port authority due to limited demand from the us navy for composite products provided by our gulfport facility 

amphibious assault ships 

  

we supply the us navy with amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships which include the us navy large deck amphibious ships lha and amphibious transport dock ships lpd the lha is a key component of the us navymarine corps requirement for 11 expeditionary strike groupsamphibious readiness groups and design construction and modernization of lhas are core to our ingalls operations in 2007 we were awarded the construction contract for lha6 america  the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized marine assault platform we delivered lha6 america in the second quarter of 2014 and are currently constructing lha7 tripoli  scheduled for delivery in 2018 

  

the lpd program is a longrunning production program in which we have generated efficiencies through shipovership learning we are currently constructing two lpd17 san antonio class amphibious transport dock ships lpd26 john p murtha  scheduled for delivery in 2016 and lpd27 portland  scheduled for delivery in 2017 we delivered lpd25 uss somerset  in 2013 and lpd23 uss anchorage  and lpd24 uss arlington  in 2012 in december 2015 we were awarded an advance procurement contract for lpd28 unnamed 

surface combatants 

  

we are a design agent for and one of only two companies that constructs the ddg51 arleigh burke class guided missile destroyers we have delivered 28 ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers to the us navy we are currently constructing ddg113 john finn  and ddg114 ralph johnson  scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2013 we were awarded a multiyear contract totaling 33 billion for construction of five additional ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers as a part of a larger us navy order for nine ddg51  arleigh burk eclass destroyers we began fabrication on ddg117 paul ignatius  in 2014 and ddg119 delbert d black  in 2015 with deliveries scheduled in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

in 2008 the us navy truncated the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer program when it restarted the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production line our participation in the ddg1000 zumwalt class program included detailed design and construction of the ships integrated composite deckhouses and hangars as well as portions of the ships aft peripheral vertical launch systems we completed our participation in this program with the delivery of the composite deckhouse of ddg1001 michael monsoor  in 2014  

  

national security cutters 

  

the us coast guards recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline the flagship of this program is the legend class nsc a multimission platform we designed and built the us coast guard ordered the first three nsc vessels from integrated coast guard systems icgs a joint venture between lockheed martin and us beginning in 2010 with the construction contract for nsc4 uscgc hamilton  the nsc contracts have been awarded directly to us nsc4 uscgc hamilton  and nsc5 uscgc james  were delivered to the us coast guard in 2014 and 2015 respectively nsc6 munro and nsc7 kimball are currently under construction and are scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2018 respectively we were awarded the construction contract for nsc8 midgett  in 2015 and it is scheduled for delivery in 2019 

newport news 

the capabilities of our newport news segment extend from our core business of designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships to businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operation management and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through department of energy doe programs our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction and refueling and complex overhaul of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to newport news operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the us navy since 1933 including all ten ships currently in active service 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier and the last of the cvn68 nimitz class cvn77 uss george hw bush  in 2009 we have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier the cvn78 gerald r ford class for over ten years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class cvn78 gerald r ford  which is scheduled for delivery in 2016 we also received awards 

in 2009 through 2015 totaling 66 billion for construction preparation detail design and construction of the second cvn78 gerald r ford class aircraft carrier cvn79 john f kennedy  

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier rcoh each rcoh takes over three years to complete and the work accounts for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and onsite fleet repair work 

we completed the rcoh for cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  and redelivered it to the us navy in 2013 we also received awards totaling 26 billion under an execution contract for the rcoh of cvn72 uss abraham lincoln which is scheduled for redelivery in 2016 we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers as well as the fact that rcoh work requires a highly trained workforce is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for future rcoh contract awards on the us navy aircraft carrier fleet 

  

aircraft carrier inactivation 

  

the us navy awarded us a 745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate cvn65 uss enterprise  the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 the cvn65 uss enterprise has a scheduled redelivery date in 2017 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as those we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation we believe that the us navy will require inactivation of aircraft carriers in the naval fleet as they reach the end of their lifespans and we intend to be positioned as the best choice for these contract awards 

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 59  submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 45  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 53 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 26 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build ssn774 virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines alternate between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and six submarines of the second block of ssn774 virginia class submarines have been delivered in 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight ssn774 virginia class submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year from 2011 through 2013 the first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014 the second was delivered in 2015 and the last submarine of the third block is scheduled for delivery in 2019 in 2014 the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten ssn774 virginia class submarines continuing the two submarines per year production rate the first submarine of the block iv contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019 and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2023 

fleet support amsec and continental maritime of san diego cmsd 

  

fleet support provides comprehensive life cycle services including depot maintenance modernization repairs logistics and technical support and planning yard services for naval and commercial vessels through our amsec and cmsd subsidiaries we have ship repair facilities in newport news virginia and san diego california which are near the us navys largest homeports of norfolk virginia and san diego respectively amsec provides naval architecture and marine engineering ship system assessments maintenance engineering and logistics services to the us navy and commercial maritime industry from 27 locations across the globe on any given day over 600 of our amsec employees are on board us navy ships assessing equipment conditions modernizing systems and training sailors through cmsd a master ship repair contractor we provide ship repair regular overhaul and selected restricted availability services pier side or in customers dry docks for the us navy we also perform emergent repair for the us navy on all classes of ships beginning in 2014 amsec and cmsd were transferred from the ingalls segment to the newport news segment 

ssbnx ohioclass replacement program 

  

the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2015 states the us navys intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic and cruise missile submarines the us navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the ssbn ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 the ssbn ohio class includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the ohio  replacement program is a 100 billion program that currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15year period at an annual budget of approximately 5 billion to 7 billion the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to electric boat we believe our experience and specialized workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort congress has delayed the start of the first ohio  replacement submarine by two years and construction is now expected to begin in 2021 with procurement of longleadtime materials in 2017 and delivery in 2030 the first ohio class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2027 with an additional submarine being retired each year thereafter by 2030 the ohio class ballistic missile submarine fleet is expected to be down to ten the current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may cause additional delay to the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured but we believe the ohio  replacement program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future 

  

energy 

  

our doe and commercial nuclear programs leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations program management and heavy manufacturing we selectively partner with experienced industry leaders and we participate in active joint ventures through our subsidiary stoller newport news nuclear inc sn3 we provide technical environmental ecological waste management remediation and consultation services to private sector companies and the doe 

newport news industrial corporation nni provides a range of support services to commercial nuclear power plants since it was founded in 1965 nni has expanded its capabilities continuing to provide support for nuclear energy facilities as well as for fossil power plants and other industrial facilities nni focuses on fabrication services construction services equipment services technical services and product sales to its customers which include both private industry and government entities such as the doe and the dod 

in january 2008 savannah river nuclear solutions llc srns our joint venture with fluor federal services inc and honeywell international inc was awarded a fiveyear 4 billion contract for site management and operations at the does savannah river site located 12 miles south of aiken south carolina which would have expired in 2013 in 2012 the doe exercised its option to extend the original contract for another three years through 2016 we have a 34  ownership interest in srns 

other 

our other segment was established in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities following our acquisition of universalpegasus international holdings inc upi upi has a 50 year history of providing project management engineering and construction management for the oil and gas industry upi has approximately 600 professionals with major office locations in houston texas calgary canada aberdeen scotland and san juan trinidad and tobago

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 9 segment information in item 8 

customers 

our revenues are primarily derived from the us government in 2015  2014  and 2013  approximately 89 88 and 94 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 7 8 and 6 respectively were generated from the us coast guard in 2015 and 2014 we generated approximately 3 and 2 of our revenues from commercial customers respectively and 1 and 2 from other government agencies respectively 

intellectual property 

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our total backlog was approximately 22 billion  and 21 billion  respectively we expect approximately 29  of backlog at december 31 2015  to be converted into sales in 2016  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source however due to consolidation in the defense industry we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

to facilitate innovative product development and evolution we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 19 million  18 million  and 22 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it has a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic benefits the us navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risks related to our business in risk factors in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  in addition any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by a government customer or must be refunded if already reimbursed 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on contracts upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we will modify our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns 

  

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the governments convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions that provide for reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those related to procurement our contracts with the us government may result in requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we prepare submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our business our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal acquisition regulation far the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in the values of contracts contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in the market because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and defueling the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities in this regard the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 2012 act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 2013 act modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier 

similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law 

we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds we are however currently engaged in a competition to build either the next amphibious assault ship lha8 or six fleet oilers taox we are also the sole builder of nscs for the us coast guard and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to a longterm teaming agreement with the other company for the production of such vessels we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of engineering services in the energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we would record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2015  our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately 2 million  which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of shipbuilding at avondale these costs are not reasonably estimable at this time due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 2 million  accrual for environmental remediation costs or our 287 million  estimate of avondale asset writedowns and restructuring costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant 

portion of any future environmental remediation costs we might incur at avondale would be recoverable in accordance with government accounting practices under the federal acquisition regulation far 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws we expect however to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced one industrial related fatality in the past seven years we strive to keep our occupational safety  health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work our cmsd facility and sn3s grand junction site have also been certified as osha vpp star sites 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe each regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 36000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 4700 engineers and designers and approximately 2300 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1100 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2015 there were 802 master shipbuilders at newport news and 289 at ingalls we employ more than 5000 veterans across the enterprise 

more than 1400 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding units each year in more than 26 crafts and advanced programs from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 4500 apprentice alumni 3000 at newport news and 1500 at ingalls continue to work with us 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in july 2017 august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement newport news will begin negotiations in early 2016 with the international association of machinist and aerospace workers iam which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 newport news radiological control calibration and laboratory technicians ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2018 approximately 35 sn3 craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

risks related to our business 

  

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy most of our revenues in 2015  were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition most of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2015  our us government contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work delays in the timing of contract approval and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the us navy and the us coast guard the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and receive additional funding only as congress makes additional appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process in continuing resolutions or in individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca reduced the dod topline budget by 487 billion from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 the bba 2013 which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion and 1013 trillion for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 respectively on november 2 2015 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 the bba 2015 which provided 80 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief of 50 billion and 30 billion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 respectively resulting in overall discretionary spending caps of 1067 trillion and 1070 trillion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 respectively sequestration remains in effect under the bca for fiscal years 2018 through 

2021 enactment of the bba 2015 enabled the house and senate appropriations committees to agree upon final appropriations levels and enabled final passage and enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provided general spending for most of the us federal government including the dod doe and the department of homeland security 

the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 specifically provided funding for construction of cvn79 john f kennedy  advance procurement funding for cvn80 enterprise  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines procurement for the cvn73 uss george washington  rcoh advance procurement for the cvn74 uss john c stennis  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production advance procurement for lha8 unnamed procurement of an additional lpd17 san antonio class warship advance procurement to accelerate the lxr program research development test and evaluation “rdte” funding for the ohio  replacement program procurement of a taox fleet oiler and procurement of an additional nsc for the us coast guard 

while the bba 2015 eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 uncertainty continues regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2018 through 2021 and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs 

the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates for fiscal year 2017 and beyond remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts or other defense spending cuts may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress continues to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2015 our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 35 of our consolidated revenue we cannot predict the impact of changes in customer priorities on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating contract costs reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which cost overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us government and us the us government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls revenues in 2015  approximately 89  were generated from fpi contracts approximately 4  were generated from ffp contracts approximately 4  were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 3  were generated from cpaf contracts of newport news 2015  revenues approximately 33  were generated from fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction contracts approximately 32  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 31  were generated from cpif contracts consisting primarily of aircraft carrier construction and rcoh contracts approximately 3  were generated from ffp contracts and approximately 1  were generated from cpaf contracts substantially all of our other segments 2015 revenues were generated from ffp contracts to the extent our mix of contract types change in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected 

  

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform under contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from one or more of our assumptions or projections or if we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers we are subject to potential delivery disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely 

affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain raw materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us government as a result of consolidation in the defense industry only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component in a timely or costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

the defense industry has implemented and we expect will continue to implement significant changes to business practices resulting from among other causes an increased focus by dod on affordability efficiencies recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control in addition the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits andor lengthened periods of time required to close open audits in addition the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced and other thresholds are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2014 the dod initiated better buying power 30 bbp 30 to address its growing concern that the united states technological superiority over potential adversaries is being threatened bbp 30 includes eight focus areas achieve affordable programs achieve dominant capabilities while controlling life cycle costs incentivize productivity in industry and government incentivize innovation in industry and government eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy promote effective competition improve tradecraft in acquisition of services and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce while some of the larger objectives remained the same as those in better buying power 20 their focus has narrowed and the circle of stakeholders has expanded 

we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod we are assessing internally how we can respond to and support these changes including how we can further reduce costs and increase productivity modify how we respond to acquisition proposals and revise our areas of focus depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on our current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

  

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must develop and maintain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and workers with the necessary skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts and attracting new contract awards 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict the reduction in shipbuilding activity by the us navy as evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 272 ships as of december 31 2015 has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which we own plus numerous other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services we expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense 

we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and submarines and we are currently engaged in a competition to build either the next amphibious assault ship lha8 or six fleet oilers taox we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build other ships for which we are currently the sole source including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships moreover reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of ssn688 los angeles class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships the 2012 national defense authorization act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2013 defense authorization act however modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was contained in previous law if a us governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the shipbuilding engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk that we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed 

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

as a us government contractor we must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement cyber security and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract 

performance and compliance costs and change on a consistent basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to allowability of compensation costs cyber security counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its various agencies including the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and internal policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information and cyber security systems if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to administrative civil or criminal proceedings which could result in fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages certain us government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges  allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on certain of our contracts upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems when appropriate we will modify our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns     

  

the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations including the far the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards and we are subject from time to time to us government investigations relating to our operations if we are convicted or otherwise found to have engaged in illegal activities or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in the values of contracts contract modifications or terminations penalties fines repayments compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require stateoftheart manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually have new technology that is supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems in developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule needed for construction the risks associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received 

  

we have experienced quality issues in the past with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may not recover all of our costs related to the wind down of shipbuilding at our avondale shipyard 

  

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard and consolidated all ingalls shipbuilding into our pascagoula shipyard in connection with and as a result of the wind down of shipbuilding at avondale we have incurred substantial restructuring costs and asset writedowns which we currently estimate at 287 million  we believe that substantially all such expenses are recoverable under existing flexiblypriced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with far provisions governing the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs 

we have engaged in communications and negotiations with the us navy since 2010 regarding the amount and recovery of our restructuring and shutdown costs in august 2015 we received a letter from the supervisor of shipbuildings contracting officer contracting officer with a preliminary determination that our method of allocating as indirect costs certain employee retention and incentive expenses which could be up to 57 million  did not comply with cost accounting allocation regulations we have responded with our basis supporting our cost allocation positions and sought a determination that supports our method of cost allocation 

we currently do not have an agreement with the us navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down of operations at avondale we may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down such costs which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time could be significant the actual restructuring expenses we incur in connection with our wind down of avondale including potential environmental costs may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover our restructuring expenses substantially in accordance with our cost recovery expectations could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our assumptions on ship contracts include the length of time to complete the contract because total costs include expected increases in wages and material prices similarly our assumptions include the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts we consider incentives awards and penalties related to contract performance in estimating revenues and profit rates and we record them when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance 

the judgment and estimation processes described above are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant natural disasters can disrupt our facilities systems or projects which can interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in addition to the types of events described above operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to negotiate and enter into insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in july 2017 august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement newport news will begin negotiations in early 2016 with iam which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 newport news radiological control calibration and laboratory technicians ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2018 approximately 35 sn3 craft employees at the hanford site near richland washington are represented under an indefinite doe site stabilization agreement 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and we negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our earnings equity and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm returns on assets will result in future changes in pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding of the plans 

timing differences exist among the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap pension funding requirements and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards cas board issued its final cas harmonization rule the rule impacted pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and was effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change other aspects of the environment or natural resources we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we have incurred and expect to incur in the future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we ceased shipbuilding construction at our avondale louisiana shipyard in 2014 our wind down of operations at this shipyard may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial agreements 

  

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness we also access these markets to obtain credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program and arrange for letters of credit a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations meet contractual or financing commitments make future investments or desirable acquisitions or respond to competitive challenges 

  

tightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers and subcontractors ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers or subcontractors ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets including brokers and dealers commercial banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be liquidated upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us under the related contract 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we may not however prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents or business partners and the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions any improper actions by our employees agents or business partners could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or 

debarment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational harm 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses degrade performance on existing contracts and expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments in determining acquisition prices which prices are allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as of december 31 2015  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 16  and 8  respectively of our total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 the second quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded goodwill impairment charges at our other segment of 16 million  59 million  and 47 million  respectively the other segment established in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition of upi is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry the goodwill impairment charges were primarily driven by continuing declines in oil prices and the resulting decreases in industry market multiples in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded an intangible asset impairment of 27 million  at our other segment as a result of declining market conditions and updated expectations 

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business the ultimate tax determination of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture projects and internal controls relating to operations these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

in pursuing our business strategy we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets the risks and costs of potential liabilities and the future prospects of business opportunities in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses transactionrelated charges liabilities amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets and charges for impairment of purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position or cash flows 

  

the size nature and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are currently and may in the future become subject to various administrative civil or criminal litigation environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claim or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own certain patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property more recently the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2015 we had 1273 million of debt and 1223 million of additional borrowing capacity under our second amended and restated credit agreement the “amended credit facility” our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 

because we use a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our various debt arrangements moreover we have significant additional borrowing capacity and may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

restrictive covenants in the indentures governing our senior notes and our amended credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the terms of our amended credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 24 

 

the indentures governing our two tranches of 5000 senior notes limit our ability among other things to 

 

in addition the terms of our amended credit facility require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit our strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes these covenants may affect how we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs these covenants may therefore affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business 

our spinoff from northrop grumman exposes us to potential liabilities including us federal income tax liabilities 

  

our spinoff from northrop grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that northrop grumman northrop grummans stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except with respect to cash received by northrop grummans stockholders in lieu of fractional shares if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction northrop grumman would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under irs regulations each member of northrop grummans consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff northrop grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the respective business or businesses that we own and operate following the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to northrop grumman such as certain tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if northrop grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform its allocated obligations 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws currently provide for a classified board of directors require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy consequently the us navy has required us to include in our contracts with the navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear work for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment would likely have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on navy and coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we provided information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million  in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy has reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million  to 47 million  while expressing its view that the gross amount of potential mischarging incurred by the navy will likely not exceed 31 million  the us coast guard informed us in june 2014 that it was provisionally reducing its withhold from 58 million  to 36 million  based on the results of our internal investigation we estimate that the maximum amount of us navy and coast guard mischarging is approximately 4 million  we are continuing discussions with our us government customers regarding the potential release of an additional portion of the withheld funds but we cannot predict whether or when these customers will agree to any additional release of the withhold amounts 

in june 2015 the doj informed us that it is investigating the matters we disclosed to the dod in january 2013 in july 2015 the doj requested information from us and we are cooperating with the doj’s requests and have provided certain information to the doj depending upon the outcome of this matter which could result in litigation by the doj against us we could be subject to civil penalties damages andor suspension or debarment from future us government contracts which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows given the early stage of our discussions with the doj we are currently unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss or to express an opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

litigation  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business although we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters 

  

in 2013 we resolved litigation against an insurance provider factory mutual insurance company fm global arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina in january 2011 we through a predecessorininterest filed suit in superior court in california against aon risk insurance services west inc aon which acted as broker to our predecessorininterest in connection with the insurance policy with fm global seeking damages for breach of contract professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation as well as declaratory relief those included damages unrecovered from fm global plus costs legal fees and expenses incurred in the lawsuit against fm global as well as interest in january 2014 we amended our complaint to allege fraud and seek punitive damages in may 2015 we entered into a settlement agreement with aon pursuant to which aon made a cash payment of 150 million  to us and we released our claims against aon 

in january 2011 the us department of justice doj first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint we received alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means we and northrop grumman obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint

in july 2012 the district court entered an order permitting us to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint received by us including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the doj to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes in december 2011 the doj filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case in february 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia granted the defendants motion to transfer venue and the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of mississippi we filed a motion to dismiss the case and a motion to disqualify relator holmes and all other matters were stayed pending resolution of those motions on june 3 2015 the district court granted our motion to disqualify holmes as relator dismissed the case as to holmes and entered final judgment in favor of us holmes has appealed the district courts decision to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit 

based upon a review to date of the information available to us we believe that we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts and that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit we therefore believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we intend to defend the matter vigorously but we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation 

we and our predecessorininterest have been in litigation with the bolivarian republic of venezuela the “republic” since 2002 over a contract for the repair refurbishment and modernization at ingalls of two foreignbuilt frigates the case proceeded towards arbitration then appeared to settle favorably but the settlement was overturned in court and the matter returned to litigation in march 2014 we filed an arbitral statement of claim asserting breaches of the contract and 173 million  in damages plus substantial interest and litigation expenses in july 2014 the republic filed in the arbitration a statement of defense denying all our allegations and a counterclaim alleging late redelivery of the frigates unfinished work and breach of warranty and asserting damages of 61 million  plus interest an arbitration hearing was held in january 2015 and we cannot predict when the arbitration panel will render a decision no assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter

overview 

our business 

for more than a century we have designed built overhauled and repaired ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard we conduct business primarily with the us government principally the department of defense dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs hii is organized into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and other through our ingalls segment we are a builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters nsc for the us coast guard and one of only two companies that builds the navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers through our newport news segment we are the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy our other segment was established in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the bca reduced the dod top line budget by 487 billion from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

in december 2013 the president signed into law the bba 2013 which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion and 1013 trillion for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 respectively on november 2 2015 the president signed into law the bba 2015 which provided 80 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief of 50 billion and 30 billion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 respectively resulting in overall discretionary spending caps of 1067 trillion and 1070 trillion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 respectively sequestration remains in effect under the bca for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 enactment of the bba 2015 enabled the house and senate appropriations committees to agree upon final appropriations levels and enabled final passage and enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which provided general spending for most of the us federal government including the dod doe and the department of homeland security 

the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 specifically provided funding for construction of cvn79 john f kennedy  advance procurement funding for cvn80 enterprise  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines procurement for the cvn73 uss george washington  rcoh advance procurement for the cvn74 uss john c stennis  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production advance procurement for lha8 unnamed procurement of an additional lpd17 san antonio class warship advance procurement to accelerate the lxr program rdte funding for the ohio  replacement program procurement of a taox fleet oiler and procurement of an additional nsc for the us coast guard 

while the bba 2015 eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 uncertainty continues regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2018 through 2021 and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs 

the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates for fiscal year 2017 and beyond remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts or other defense spending cuts may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress continues to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations and peacekeeping we believe the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in march 2014 the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr built upon the 2012 defense strategic guidance prioritizing three strategic pillars defending the homeland building security globally by projecting us influence and deterring aggression and remaining prepared to win decisively against any adversary should deterrence fail guided by this updated defense strategy dod plans to rebalance the military over the next decade and put it on a sustainable path to protect and advance us interests and sustain us global leadership 

we expect that the dod execution of its strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while facing additional major budget cuts that began in 2013 while the bba 2015 established new budget caps and provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for 2018 and beyond bca spending caps could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and nondefense discretionary programs decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in march 2015 the us navy released its 2016 shipbuilding plan which anticipates a fleet of 308 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 34 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 34 support vessels the 2016 shipbuilding plan also notes that the four ssgn currently in service will retire in the mid2020s and the us navy is exploring the possibility of inserting a quadpack of large diameter payload tubes in block v ssn774 virginia class submarines to offset the loss of the ssgn strike capability the 2016 shipbuilding plan also acknowledges that the dod will encounter several challenges in executing the plan particularly with regard to funding new submarines to replace the ohio class nuclear ballistic submarines significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material effect 

on our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is anticipated that the us navy will submit a shipbuilding plan to congress subsequent to submission of the fiscal year 2017 presidents budget request which will provide additional details regarding the force structure 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys new lcs the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control the most recent initiatives included in the september 2014 bbp 30 are organized into eight major areas achieve affordable programs achieve dominant capabilities while controlling lifecycle costs incentivize productivity in industry and government incentivize innovation in industry and government eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy promote effective competition improve tradecraft in acquisition of services and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce while the impact to our business resulting from these initiatives remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risks related to our business in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these areas it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we have other types of contracts such as services and commercial arrangements for which revenues are recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured costs related to these contracts are expensed as incurred we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2015  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program the legend class nsc program and the lpd17  san antonio class program including delivered ships the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the lha6 america class program and the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh and contract impacts of the aon litigation settlement during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments included lower performance on cvn78 gerald r ford as well as other individually insignificant adjustments 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program the legend class nsc program the lpd17  san antonio class program including delivered lpd ships and the construction contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and risk retirement on the legend class nsc program for the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the closing of our gulfport facility costs and delays on lha6 america associated with the remediation of mechanical issues identified during testing as well as unfavorable performance on lpd25 somerset including costs and delays associated with repairing damage caused by underwater debris during preparation for sea trials 

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

purchase accounting goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was 956 million  and 1026 million  respectively 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2015  impairment test  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10 its corresponding carrying value as of november 30 2015 except for the oil and gas reporting unit in our other segment 

december 31 2015 impairment test  while the november 30 2015 annual impairment test did not result in an impairment considering the limited excess fair value of goodwill over its carrying value in our oil and gas reporting unit and the continued decline in oil prices and related industry activity levels we performed an interim assessment of goodwill as of december 31 2015 our determination of fair value as of december 31 2015 considered industry events that occurred in the period since our annual goodwill impairment test as well as the updated long term outlook for this reporting unit those events included continued deterioration in the oil and gas markets numerous industrywide project deferrals and capital spending cuts announced by industry leaders the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of december 31 2015 and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 16 million  at our other segment in the fourth quarter of 2015 

may 31 2015 impairment test  we continuously monitor industry events and changes in circumstances in the industries in which our reporting units conduct business in consideration of the oil and gas reporting unit’s sensitivity to developments within its industry the continued decline in crude oil prices significant reductions in its customer capital spending plans and project delays we concluded an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our oil and gas reporting unit was still higher than its carrying value as of may 31 2015 our assessment considered the aforementioned changes to expectations that were considered as part of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2014 as a result of our analysis we recorded a 59 million  goodwill impairment charge at our other segment in the second quarter of 2015 

november 30 2014 impairment test  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2014 and determined that goodwill at our other segment was impaired by 47 million  the goodwill impairment 

charge was primarily driven by the drop in oil prices and the resulting decrease in industry market multiples we determined that the estimated fair value of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2014 

other intangible assets   we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired 

december 31 2015 impairment test   we performed an impairment test as of december 31 2015 on the amortizable intangible assets that arose from the upi acquisition which reside in our oil and gas reporting unit within our other segment the oil and gas asset group’s longlived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and to a lesser degree trade name and developed technology we performed our impairment test considering the latest market conditions and expectations as well as lower anticipated revenue and profitability based on the nature of upis intangible assets we performed the recoverability test at the reporting unit level in connection with the recoverability test we reevaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets and determined the total undiscounted pretax cash flows generated by the reporting unit over the remaining useful life of the primary asset customer relationships the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the total undiscounted pretax cash flows and as a result the intangible assets were written down by 27 million  charged against cost of sales and service revenues within income from operations at our other segment 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were 18 million  and 22 million  respectively and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2015  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business 

operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related benefit plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and us gaap financial accounting standards fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our us government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on us government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost “fascas adjustment” as operating income loss within general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  our cas costs in excess of fas expenses were 104 million  and 72 million  respectively and for the year ended december 31 2013  our fas expense exceeded our cas costs by 61 million  

the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below different funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code in funding our plans we consider various factors including the minimum funding requirements maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were 

used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to lower levels over the next few years the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act “hatfa” in 2014 and bba 2015 successively provided for the continuation of higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phaseout period we consider the effects of legislation such as map21 hatfa and bba 2015 in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding on the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflect the effects of the rule harmonization affects pension costs on contracts over a phasein period ending in 2017 our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions offered under map21 hatfa and bba 2015 because of the method permitted under harmonization we use to determine the cas interest rate which is a current market rate 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment we annually review our assumptions which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event such as an amendment curtailment   or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 473  and 434  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 458  and 422  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longterm prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we used a 750 expected longterm rate of return assumption to record 2015 and 2014 pension expense we will continue to use this 750 assumption for recording 2016 fas pension expense 

mortality   mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity as of december 31 2014 we updated our mortality assumptions to reflect our recent mortality experience and the anticipated effects of future mortality improvements the effect of the changes in the mortality 

assumptions increased our december 31 2014 pension related benefit obligations by approximately 54 million or 1 the impact on other postretirement benefits was not material the increase was treated as an actuarial loss and subject to amortization in future periods as described below we reflected updated mortality assumptions in our cas costs if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions could be affected 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants in 2015  the actual return on assets was approximately negative 100 which was less than the expected return assumption of 750 for the year ended december 31 2015  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 39 and 36 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of 398 million and an actuarial gain of 363 million respectively as of december 31 2015  

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



assuming a 750 expected return on asset assumption a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted 

cas cost   in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the pension discount rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality bonds when harmonization is fully phased in the greater of the two liabilities will be used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization the four year phase in period that commenced in 2014 requires the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities 

other fas and cas pension considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the employees average future service life of approximately 12 years under cas actuarial gains and losses were amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under harmonization the amortization period for cas changed to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years subject to certain 

limitations for fas we do not use this smoothing method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses faster than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly 

the fascas adjustment in 2015  was a net benefit of 104 million  compared to a net benefit of 72 million  in 2014  the favorable  change was driven by the phasein of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014   the fascas adjustment in 2013 was a net expense of 61 million  the favorable change from 2013 to 2014 was driven by lower fas expense primarily due to higher discount rates and plan assets at the end of 2013 the full year effect of the 2013 postretirement benefits amendment and the phasein of harmonization our projected 2016 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the very limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

accumulated other comprehensive income  changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were 1412 million  and 1447 million  respectively the decrease in these actuarial losses in 2015  was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations which accounted for 363 million offset by 2015 actual asset returns being less than expected by 398 million partially offset by 88 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were 19 million  and 20 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2015  primarily resulted from amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans in addition to participating in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers compensation liability was discounted at 212  and 248  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 48 million and 57 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 825 million  and 846 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the following table 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consist of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consisted of the following 

2015   product sales in 2015   decreased   47 million  or 1  from 2014  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 115 million in 2015  primarily due to lower volumes in amphibious assault ships and the legend class nsc program partially offset by higher volumes in surface combatants newport news product sales increased 68 million in 2015  as a result of higher volumes in submarines and energy partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carriers 

service revenues in 2015   increased   110 million  or 9  from 2014  service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 17 million in 2015  as a result of higher volumes in surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 96 million in 2015  primarily driven by higher volumes in fleet support services partially offset by lower volumes in energy services service revenues at our other segment decreased 3 million in 2015 primarily due to lower volumes in oil and gas services 

2014   product sales in 2014   decreased   89 million  or 2  from 2013  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 139 million in 2014  primarily due to lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants newport news product sales increased 50 million in 2014  as a result of higher volumes in submarines and energy partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carriers 

service revenues in 2014   increased   226 million  or 22  from 2013  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 15 million in 2014  as a result of lower volumes in amphibious assault ships and surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 104 million in 2014  primarily as a result of the acquisition of sn3 as well as higher volumes in aircraft carriers services partially offset by lower volumes in fleet support services service revenues at our other segment were 137 million in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of upi 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2015   cost of product sales in 2015   decreased   170 million  or 4  compared to 2014  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 225 million in 2015  primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation and the lower sales volumes described above cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 55 million in 2015  primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above and yeartoyear variances in contract mix cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined  from 786  in 2014  to 762  in 2015  primarily driven by the settlement of the aon litigation higher performance in amphibious assault ships and yeartoyear variances in contract mix partially offset by lower performance in aircraft carriers 

2014   cost of product sales in 2014   decreased   206 million  or 4  compared to 2013  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 236 million in 2014  primarily due to performance improvement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and the lower sales volumes described above cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 30 million in 2014  primarily due to higher sales volumes described above and yeartoyear 

variances in contract mix cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined  from 809  in 2013  to 786  in 2014  primarily driven by performance improvement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and risk retirement on the legend class nsc program 

cost of service revenues   

2015   cost of service revenues in 2015   increased   147 million  or 14  compared to 2014  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 15 million in 2015  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 98 million in 2015  primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above cost of service revenues at our other segment increased 34 million in 2015  primarily as a result of an intangible asset impairment cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased  from 844  in 2014  to 884  in 2015  primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment at the other segment yeartoyear variances in contract mix and lower performance in aircraft carriers and oil and gas services 

2014    cost of service revenues in 2014   increased   163 million  or 18  compared to 2013  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 20 million in 2014  consistent with the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 61 million in 2014  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above partially offset by the impact of a change in our contract mix following the acquisition of sn3 cost of service revenues at our other segment were 122 million in 2014  primarily resulting from the acquisition of upi cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased  from 871  in 2013  to 844  in 2014  due to yeartoyear variances in contract mix primarily resulting from the acquisition of sn3 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2015   income from operating investments net decreased   1 million  or 9  to 10 million  in 2015  from 11 million  in 2014  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2014    income from operating investments net decreased   3 million  or 21  to 11 million  in 2014  from 14 million  in 2013  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2015   general and administrative expenses in 2015   decreased   57 million  or 8  compared to 2014  this decrease was primarily the result of a favorable change in the fascas adjustment and lower overhead costs offset by the inclusion of upi and higher state tax expense 

2014    general and administrative expenses in 2014   decreased   13 million  or 2  compared to 2013  this decrease was primarily the result of a favorable change in the fascas adjustment partially offset by increases resulting from the amortization of avondale restructuring costs the inclusion of upi and sn3 and higher state tax expense 

impairment of goodwill 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for 

goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2015    we recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015 of 75 million  in our other segment see note 12 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

2014    we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 of 47 million  in our other segment see note 12 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

2013    we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2013 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for total operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a metric that we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe that segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



segment operating income 

2015   segment operating income in 2015  was 667 million  compared to 585 million  in 2014  the increase  was primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation higher performance and volumes in submarines and higher performance on amphibious assault ships partially offset by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the other segment and lower performance on aircraft carriers 

2014   segment operating income in 2014  was 585 million  compared to 567 million  in 2013  the increase  was primarily due to performance improvement and risk retirement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and the legend class nsc program as well as the unfavorable impact in the prior year of the gulfport facility closure partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge described above and the favorable impact in the prior year of hurricane insurance recoveries 

activity within each segment is discussed in segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2015   the fascas adjustment in 2015  was a net benefit of 104 million  compared to a net benefit of 72 million  in 2014  the favorable  change was driven by the phasein of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 

2014   the fascas adjustment in 2014  was a net benefit of 72 million  compared to a net expense of 61 million  in 2013  the favorable  change was driven by lower fas expense due primarily to higher discount rates and plan assets at the end of 2013 the full year effect of the 2013 postretirement benefits amendment and the phasein of harmonization 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2016  to be a net benefit of approximately 137 million 161 million fas and 298 million cas primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization and higher fas discount rates partially offset by lower than expected 2015 asset returns the expected fascas adjustment is subject to change during 2016  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items 

deferred state income taxes 

deferred state income taxes reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income while the current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2015   the deferred state income tax expense  remained constant at 2 million  in 2015  and 2014  deferred state tax expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards 

2014   the deferred state income tax expense  in 2014  was 2 million  compared to a benefit  of 6 million  in 2013  this change was primarily attributable to nonrecurring adjustments related to establishing a valuation allowance for a state tax loss carryforward and the trueup of 2013 deferred taxes these increases were partially offset by changes in the timing of contract taxable income and reserves that are not currently deductible for tax purposes 

interest expense 

2015   interest expense in 2015  was 137 million  compared to 149 million  in 2014  the decrease  was primarily a result of refinancing 6875 senior notes with 5000 senior notes and repayment in full of the term loans partially offset by loss on early extinguishment of debt see note 14 debt in item 8 

2014   interest expense in 2014  was 149 million  compared to 118 million  in 2013  the increase  was primarily a result of a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 see note 14 debt in item 8

2015    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 361  in 2015  compared to 333  in 2014  the increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily attributable to adjustments to the domestic manufacturing deduction and an increase in the goodwill impairment that is not amortizable for tax purposes 

2014   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 333  in 2014  compared to 338  in 2013  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by the amount of the goodwill impairment that is not deductible for tax purposes 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and other we established the other segment in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities in the first quarter of 2014 we realigned our segments in order to optimize our operating structure as a result of this realignment our amsec and cmsd businesses were transferred from the ingalls segment to the newport news segment we have reflected the 2014 realignment in prior financial reporting periods on an asif basis which has resulted in the transfer of revenue operating profit assets and liabilities between the ingalls and newport news segments none of these changes impacted our previously reported consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on january 30 2015 we completed the acquisition of usg usgs postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows are reported within our newport news segment on may 30 2014 we completed the acquisition of upi we report the postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows of upi as part of our other segment on january 2 2014 we completed the acquisition of sn3 sn3s postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows are reported within our newport news segment

key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income

other 



sales and service revenues 

2015   revenues in the other segment for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased   3 million  or 2  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower volumes in oil and gas services 

2014   other revenues in 2014  were 137 million  primarily due to the acquisition of upi on may 30 2014 

segment operating income 

2015   operating loss  in the other segment for the year ended december 31 2015  was 134 million  compared to an operating loss  of 59 million  in 2014 the decrease  was primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and lower performance in oil and gas services 

2014   other operating loss for the year ended december 31 2014  was 59 million  primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of 47 million  described above 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2015  was approximately 22 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2015  and 2014  



we expect approximately 29  of the 22 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2015  to be converted into sales in 2016  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2015  and 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  as classified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2015   cash provided by  operating activities was 828 million  in 2015  compared to 716 million  in 2014  the favorable change of 112 million  in operating cash flow was primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans partially offset by higher payments for income taxes and a change in trade working capital the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments respectively 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2016  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2014   cash provided by  operating activities was 716 million  in 2014  compared to 236 million  in 2013  the increase  of 480 million   was due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable and retirement benefit funding in 2014  we paid net cash of 161 million  for federal and state income taxes 

investing activities 

2015   cash used in  investing activities was 141 million  in 2015  a decrease  of 296 million  from 2014  the favorable change in investing cash flow was driven by the 2014 acquisitions of upi and sn3 the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015 and proceeds from the aon litigation settlement for 2016  we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment excluding discretionary projects to be between two and three percent of annual revenues 

2014   cash used in  investing activities was 437 million  in 2014  an increase  of 356 million  from 2013  this increase in cash used in investing activities was driven by the acquisitions of sn3 and upi 

financing activities 

2015   cash used in  financing activities in 2015  was 783 million  compared to 332 million   used in   2014  the increase was primarily due to an additional 316 million of longterm debt repayment 94 million of repurchases of common stock 32 million of cash dividend payments 11 million of debt related expenditures as well as a 6 million decrease in excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation and a 2 million decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised partially offset by a 10 million decrease in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements in 2015  compared to 2014  

2014   cash used in  financing activities in 2014  was 332 million  compared to 169 million   used in   2013  the increase was primarily due to an additional 66 million of debt related expenditures 24 million of cash dividend payments and 19 million of repurchases of common stock in addition to 64 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements in 2014  compared to 2013  

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2015   free cash flow increased 89 million  from 2014  primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans partially offset by higher payments for income taxes capital expenditures and a change in trade working capital 

2014   free cash flow increased 454 million  from 2013  due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable and retirement benefit funding partially offset by increased capital expenditures in 2014 

retirement related benefit plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences maintaining minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded status if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions could be affected we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 99 million  123 million  and 301 million  in the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our qualified pension plans were funded 84 and 86 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2015  and 2014  these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to develop respective obligations for these two different purposes we expect our 2016  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 167 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 33 million  33 million  and 38 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we expect our 2016  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 37 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis

through our ingalls operations we design and construct nonnuclear ships for the us navy and us coast guard including amphibious assault ships surface combatants and national security cutters nscs we are a supplier of amphibious assault ships to the us navy and have built 28 of the 62 ddg51 arleigh burke class of aegis guided missile destroyers in active service we are also the sole builder of the large multimission nscs for the us coast guard our ingalls shipbuilding site is located in pascagoula mississippi these facilities offer a collection of manufacturing capabilities that include a 660ton gantry crane and a land based test facility 

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at avondale and consolidated that activity at our pascagoula mississippi facility which we believe will enhance our competitive position by decreasing our fixed overhead expenses improving facility utilization to provide a more costefficient construction process centralizing our shipbuilding learning and increasing the benefits of serial production and reducing program costs in july 2014 we closed our gulfport composite center of excellence the gulfport facility in gulfport mississippi due to limited demand from the us navy for composite products provided by our gulfport facility 

amphibious assault ships 

  

we are a supplier to the us navy of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships which include the us navy large deck amphibious ships lha amphibious transport dock ships lpd and multipurpose amphibious assault ships lhd the lha is a key component of the us navymarine corps requirement for 11 expeditionary strike groupsamphibious readiness groups and design construction and modernization of lhas are core to our ingalls operations construction of lhd1 wasp class multipurpose amphibious assault ships concluded with our delivery of lhd8 uss makin island in 2009 in 2007 we were awarded the construction contract for lha6 america  the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized marine assault platform we delivered lha6 america in the second quarter of 2014 and are currently constructing lha7 tripoli  scheduled for delivery in 2018 

  

the lpd program is a longrunning production program in which we have generated efficiencies through shipovership learning we are currently constructing two lpd17 san antonio class amphibious transport dock ships lpd26 john p murtha  scheduled for delivery in 2016 and lpd27 portland  scheduled for delivery in 2017 in our pascagoula shipyard we delivered lpd25 somerset  in 2013 and lpd23 anchorage  and lpd24 arlington  in 2012 

surface combatants 

  

we are a design agent for and one of only two companies that constructs the ddg51 arleigh burke class guided missile destroyers we have delivered 28 ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers to the us navy including ddg110 uss william p lawrence  in february 2011 we are currently constructing ddg113 john finn  and ddg114 ralph johnson  scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2013 we were awarded a multiyear contract totaling 33 billion for construction of five additional ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers as a part of a larger us navy order for nine ddg51  arleigh burk eclass destroyers we began fabrication on the first ship of that award ddg117 paul ignatius  in 2014 and it is scheduled for delivery in 2018 

in 2008 the us navy truncated the ddg1000 zumwalt class program when it restarted the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production line our participation in the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyers program included detailed design and construction of the ships integrated composite deckhouses and hangars as well as portions of the ships aft peripheral vertical launch systems we completed our participation in this program with the delivery of the composite deckhouse of ddg1001 michael monsoor  in 2014   the us navy has decided to acquire a steel deckhouse structure for the third and final ship of the class 

  

national security cutters 

  

the us coast guards recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline the flagship of this program is the legend class nsc a multimission platform we designed and built the us coast guard ordered the first three nsc vessels from integrated coast guard systems icgs a joint venture between lockheed martin and us pursuant to an indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq contract for the deepwater modernization program the first national security cutter nsc1 uscgc bertholf  was delivered to the us coast guard in 2008 followed by nsc2 uscgc waesche  in 2009 and nsc3 uscgc stratton  in 2011 beginning in 2010 with the construction contract for nsc4 uscgc hamilton  the nsc contracts have been awarded directly to ingalls nsc4 uscgc hamilton  was delivered to the us coast guard in 2014 nsc5  james and   nsc6 munro are currently under construction and are scheduled for delivery in 2015 and 2016 respectively ingalls was awarded a construction contract for nsc7 kimball and a contract to purchase longlead materials for nsc8 midgett  in 2014 we have begun construction on nsc7 kimball  and it is scheduled for delivery in 2018 

newport news 

the capabilities of our newport news operations extend from our core business of designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships to businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operation management and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through department of energy doe programs our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities which include 

seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock serviced by a 1050ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction and refueling and complex overhaul of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to our operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the us navy since 1933 including all ten ships currently in active service 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier and the last of the cvn68 nimitz class cvn77 uss george hw bush  in 2009 we have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier the cvn78 gerald r ford class for over ten years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class cvn78 gerald r ford  which is scheduled for delivery in 2016 we also received awards in 2009 through 2014 totaling 33 billion under a construction preparation contract for the second cvn78 gerald r ford class aircraft carrier cvn79 john f kennedy  this contract includes design planning procurement of longleadtime materials and limited fabrication as well as continued research and development with key suppliers 

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes over three years to complete and the work accounts for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and onsite fleet repair work 

we completed the rcoh for cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  and redelivered it to the us navy in 2013 we have also received awards totaling 26 billion under an execution contract for the rcoh of cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers as well as the fact that rcoh work requires a highly trained workforce is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly positions us for the award of future rcoh contracts on the current and future us navy aircraft carrier fleet 

  

aircraft carrier inactivation 

  

the us navy awarded us a 745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate cvn65 uss enterprise  the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 with a scheduled redelivery date in 2016 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as those we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation we believe that the us navy will require inactivation of aircraft carriers in the naval fleet as they reach the end of their lifespans and we intend to be positioned as the best choice to be awarded that work 

  

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 58  submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 44  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 54 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 25 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build ssn774 virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines alternate between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and the six submarines of the second block of ssn774 virginia class submarines have been delivered in 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight ssn774 virginia class submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year from 2011 through 2013 the first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014 the second will be delivered in 2015 and the last submarine of the third block is scheduled for delivery in 2019 in 2014 the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten ssn774 virginia class submarines continuing the two ships per year production rate the first ship of the block iv contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019 and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2023 

fleet support amsec and continental maritime of san diego cmsd 

  

fleet support provides comprehensive life cycle services including depot maintenance modernization repairs logistics and technical support and planning yard services for naval and commercial vessels through our amsec and cmsd subsidiaries we have ship repair facilities in newport news virginia and san diego california which are near the us navys largest homeports of norfolk virginia and san diego respectively amsec provides naval architecture and marine engineering ship system assessments maintenance engineering and logistics services to the us navy and commercial maritime industry from 27 locations across the globe on any given day over 600 of our amsec employees are on board us navy ships assessing equipment conditions modernizing systems and training sailors through cmsd a master ship repair contractor we provide ship repair regular overhaul and selected restricted availability services pier side or in customers dry docks for the us navy we also perform emergent repair for the us navy on all classes of ships beginning in 2014 amsec and cmsd were transferred from the ingalls segment to the newport news segment 

ssbnx ohioclass replacement program 

  

the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2015 states the us navys intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic and cruise missile submarines the us navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the ssbn ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 the ssbn ohio class includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the ohio  replacement program is a 100 billion program that currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15year period at an annual budget of approximately 5 billion to 7 billion the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to electric boat we believe our experience and specialized workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort but no decisions have been made regarding that aspect of the program congress has delayed the start of the first ohio  replacement submarine by two years and construction is now expected to begin in 2021 with procurement of longleadtime materials in 2017 and delivery in 2030 the first ohio class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2027 with an additional submarine being retired each year thereafter by 2030 the ohio class ballistic missile submarine fleet is expected to be down to ten the current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may cause additional delay to the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured but we believe the ohio  replacement program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future 

  

energy 

  

our doe and commercial nuclear programs leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations program management and heavy manufacturing we selectively partner with experienced industry leaders and we participate in active joint ventures through our subsidiary stoller newport news nuclear inc sn3 formerly the sm stoller corporation we provide technical environmental ecological waste management remediation and consultation services to private sector companies and the doe 

newport news industrial corporation nni provides a range of support services to commercial nuclear power plants since it was founded in 1965 nni has expanded its capabilities continuing to provide support for nuclear energy facilities as well as for fossil power plants and other industrial facilities nni focuses on fabrication services construction services equipment services technical services and product sales to its customers which include both private industry and government entities such as the doe and the dod 

in january 2008 savannah river nuclear solutions llc srns our joint venture with fluor federal services inc and honeywell international inc was awarded a fiveyear 4 billion contract for site management and operations at the does savannah river site located 12 miles south of aiken south carolina in september 2012 the doe exercised its option to extend the original contract for another three years we have a 34  ownership interest in srns 

other 

our other segment was established in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities following our acquisition of universalpegasus international holdings inc upi upi has a 50 year history of providing project management engineering and construction management for the oil and gas industry upi has approximately 1000 professionals serving clients in over 50 countries with major office locations in houston texas calgary canada aberdeen scotland and san juan trinidad and tobago

huntington ingalls industries inc was incorporated in delaware on august 4 2010 our principal executive offices are located at 4101 washington avenue newport news virginia 23607 our telephone number is 757 3802000 and our home page on the internet is wwwhuntingtoningallscom references to our website in this report are provided as a convenience and do not constitute and should not be viewed as incorporation by reference of the information contained on or available through the website accordingly such information should not be considered part of this report 

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 8 segment information in item 8 

customers 

our revenues were primarily derived from the us government in 2014  2013  and 2012  in 2014  2013  and 2012  approximately 88 94 and 96 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 8 6 and 4 respectively were generated from the us coast guard in 2014 we generated approximately 2 of our revenues from commercial customers and 2 from other government agencies 

intellectual property 

we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our total backlog was approximately 21 billion  and 18 billion  respectively we expect approximately 28  of backlog at december 31 2014  to be converted into sales in 2015  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source however due to consolidation in the defense industry we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 18 million  22 million  and 21 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it has a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic benefits the us navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risks related to our business in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by a government customer or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits and suspension or debarment 

the us government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on contracts subject to these regulations upon its assessment that deficiencies exist 

with one or more of our business systems where appropriate we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns 

  

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the governments convenience contractors are generally protected by provisions that provide for reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not for the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

government contractors must comply with a significant volume of procurement regulations and other requirements contracting with the us government may result in our filing of requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible we prepare submit and negotiate reas in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to additional regulations that include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in the value of contracts contract modifications or terminations penalties fines compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment 

competition 

in our primary business of designing building overhauling and repairing military ships we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in the market because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and defueling the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities in this regard the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 2012 act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 2013 act modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft 

carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law 

we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are also the sole supplier of nscs for the us coast guard and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and we are party to a longterm teaming agreement with the other company for the production of such vessels we are one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

we compete with a variety of companies in the provision of engineering services in the energy and oil and gas markets 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated remediation costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2014  our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately 2 million  which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of shipbuilding at avondale these costs are not reasonably estimable at this time however due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 2 million  accrual for environmental remediation costs or our 284 million  estimate of avondale asset writedowns 

and restructuring costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant portion of any future environmental remediation costs we might incur at avondale would be recoverable in accordance with government accounting practices under the federal acquisition regulation far 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives we have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws we expect however to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced three industrial related fatalities in the past seven years we strive to keep our occupational safety  health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work our cmsd facility and sn3s grand junction site have also been certified as osha vpp star sites 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 38000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades with approximately 5200 engineers and designers and approximately 2300 employees with advanced degrees our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration employees and approximately 1150 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of “master shipbuilder” as of december 31 2014 there were 886 master shipbuilders at newport news and 235 at ingalls we employ more than 6000 veterans across the enterprise 

our newport news shipbuilding apprentice school trains approximately 800 apprentices each year in 19 crafts and trades and several advanced programs our ingalls apprentice school currently has approximately 600 regular apprentices in its programs and our amsec subsidiary has approximately 25 apprentices currently in training apprentices are paid as fulltime employees for the duration of their studies and usually continue to work with us upon graduation from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 5000 apprentice alumni 3000 at newport news and 2000 at ingalls continue to work with us 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of 11 collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in july 2017 august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees all of which expire in march 2018 craft employees at our waggaman louisiana location are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in june 2019 approximately 90 craft employees of sn3 are represented under two collective bargaining agreements which expire in february 2015 and september 2017 or under a doe site agreement for those working at the hanford washington site we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

our business consists primarily of the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy most of our revenues in 2014  were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition most of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2014  our us government contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work delays in the timing of contract approval and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs changes in customer priorities and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the us navy and the us coast guard the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and may receive additional funding only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process in continuing resolutions or in individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca reduced the dod topline budget by 487 billion from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 the bipartisan budget act which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and 1013 trillion for fiscal year 2015 sequestration remains in effect under the bca for fiscal years 2016 through 2021 enactment of the bipartisan budget act enabled the house and senate appropriations committees to agree upon appropriations levels across the 12 appropriations subcommittees including defense appropriations and homeland security and to subsequently pass the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act for fiscal year 2015 the fy 

2015 act however the homeland security department including the us coast guard remains under a fiscal year 2014 continuing resolution until february 27 2015 in order to support consideration by the 114th congress of fiscal year 2015 funding levels regarding immigration activities 

the fy 2015 act specifically provided funding for procurement of cvn79 john f kennedy  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines advance procurement for the cvn73 uss george washington  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production and advance procurement for lha7 tripoli  the fy 2015 act also provided 1 billion for the procurement of an additional lpd17 san antonio class ship and research development test and evaluation rdte funding for the ohio  replacement program 

while the bipartisan budget act eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 significant uncertainty exists regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2016 through 2021 and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs 

the fiscal year 2016 presidents budget request was delivered in early february 2015 the ability of congress to pass a fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the homeland security department as well as the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates for fiscal year 2016 and beyond remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts other defense spending cuts or the prospective lack of a fiscal year 2015 homeland security appropriations bill may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or canceled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the budget environment including sequestration as currently mandated remains a significant longterm risk considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry we believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country the defense industrial base including us and the customers employees suppliers subcontractors investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base although it is difficult to determine specific impacts we expect that over the longer term the budget environment may result in lower contract awards revenues profits and cash flows from our us government contracts congress continues to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have longterm impacts on us and the entire defense industry 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning we cannot predict the impact of such changes on existing followon replacement or future programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract but not for the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to 

technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating contract costs reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us government and us the us government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls revenues in 2014  approximately 90  were generated from fpi contracts approximately 4  were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 4  were generated from ffp contracts and approximately 2  were generated from cpff contracts of newport news 2014  revenues approximately 42  were generated from cpif contracts which primarily included aircraft carrier construction and rcoh contracts approximately 27  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 25  were generated from fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction contracts approximately 4  were generated from ffp contracts and approximately 2  were generated from cpaf contracts substantially all of our other segments 2014 revenues were generated from ffp contracts to the extent our mix of contract types change in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected 

  

our earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform under contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if our actual experience differs significantly from one or more of our assumptions or projections or if we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability depend in part upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers we are subject to potential delivery disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in 

addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in connection with our us government contracts we are required to procure certain raw materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us government as a result of consolidation in the defense industry only one supplier exists for certain components we acquire the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component in a timely or costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our results of operations depend upon new contract awards 

  

the prospects of us shipyards including ours are materially affected by their success in securing significant us navy contract awards in february 2006 the us navy presented to congress a goal of achieving and maintaining a fleet of 313 ships each year the us navy presents to congress the navys annual report to congress on longrange plan for construction of naval vessels the shipbuilding plan which includes the navys shipbuilding plan for the next five years and a longrange projection of new ship construction for the following 25 years 

the us navy’s 2015 shipbuilding plan states that the service’s overall inventory goal is 306 battle force ships the plan falls short of meeting the navys inventory goals for some types of ships in some years but the shortfalls are generally smaller than in prior shipbuilding plans under the 2015 shipbuilding plan the us navy would buy a total of 264 ships from 2015 through 2044 comprised of 218 combat ships and 46 combat logistics and support ships given the rate at which the navy plans to retire ships from the fleet that construction plan would not achieve a fleet equal to the inventory goal of 306 ships until 2019 under new rules for counting ships that the navy implemented this year or until 2022 under the old counting rules 

the us navy’s 2015 shipbuilding plan at least for 2015 through 2019 is based on an assumption of funding at the president’s requested level which exceeds the amounts scheduled under current law current law caps discretionary funding through 2021 in submitting its report the us navy described the 2015 shipbuilding plan as “difficult to execute” under current fiscal constraints and it separately identified changes it would make to the plan if funding for defense equals the amounts scheduled under the current sequestration law those changes include buying eight fewer ships including three fewer destroyers and one less attack submarine from 2015 through 2019 chartering and leasing three fleet oilers rather than buying them and putting six destroyers in a reduced status the navy has also indicated that the refueling and continued operation of cvn73 uss george washington remains problematic under sequestration 

  

the us navy’s 2015 shipbuilding plan anticipates a fleet of 306 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 33 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 33 support vessels the 2015 shipbuilding plan also notes that the four ssgn currently in service will be retired in the mid2020s and the us navy is exploring the possibility of inserting a quadpack of large diameter payload tubes in block v ssn774 virginia class submarines to offset the loss of the ssgn strike capability the 2015 shipbuilding plan acknowledges that the dod will encounter several challenges in executing the plan particularly with regard to funding new submarines to replace the ohio class nuclear ballistic submarines 

we believe our shipbuilding programs are a high priority for national defense but under federal budgetary pressures one or more of our programs may be reduced extended or terminated by our us government customers potential actions that could negatively affect us include the deferral of production of new amphibious ships the reduction in the number of planned large surface combatants an increase in the procurement interval for aircraft carriers beyond five years and postponement or cancellation of the rcoh for cvn73 uss  george washington  in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2014  our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 39  of our consolidated revenue significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes to department of defense business practices could have a material effect on dods procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

the defense industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices resulting from among other items an increased focus by dod on affordability efficiencies recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control in addition the dcma and dcaa have implemented cost recoverycost savings initiatives designed to prioritize efforts to recover costs as a result of certain of these initiatives we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits andor a lengthened periods of time required to close open audits more recently the thresholds for certain allowable costs including compensation costs have been significantly reduced; other thresholds are being challenged debated and in certain cases modified significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2014 the dod initiated better buying power 30 bbp 30 to address its growing concern that the united states technological superiority over potential adversaries is being threatened bbp 30 has eight focus areas achieve affordable programs achieve dominant capabilities while controlling lifecycle costs incentivize productivity in industry and government incentivize innovation in industry and government eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy promote effective competition improve tradecraft in acquisition of services and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce while some of the larger objectives remained the same as its previous effort better buying power 20 their focus has narrowed and the circle of stakeholders has expanded 

we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod we are taking steps internally to assess how we can respond to and support these changes including how we can further reduce costs and increase productivity modify how we respond to proposals and revise our areas of focus depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

  

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must develop and sustain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of engineers and skilled workers at competitive costs and with the necessary skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts and attracting new business 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict while the us navys 2015 long range plan anticipates a fleet size of 306 ships the plan does not include enough ships to fully support all elements of the navys ships goal over the 30year period the us navy currently projects that shortfalls would occur at various points during this 30year period in ballistic missile submarines cruisersdestroyers attack submarines and amphibious ships declines in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and we may in the future compete with the same 

and other defense contractors to build other ships for which we are currently the sole source if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers two existing us governmentowned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of ssn688 los angeles class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships the 2012 national defense authorization act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2013 defense authorization act however modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was contained in previous law if a us governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the business of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk that we may not be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and future surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have performed 

overcapacity in the us shipbuilding market may reduce our market share or our ability to secure contract awards at profitable prices 

the reduced level of shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 287 ships as of december 31 2014  has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which we own plus numerous other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels we ceased all shipbuilding construction operations in one of our three major shipyards in 2014 competition for future shipbuilding programs is expected to be intense additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services future rationalization of shipyard capacity in the united states might occur and we could be affected by shipyard consolidation or closures as a result of the reduced level of us navy spending on ship construction such consolidation or closures could have a significant effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

us government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including those relating to procurement and nuclear operations government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs and change on a consistent basis in addition our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs new laws regulations or procurement requirements or changes to existing ones including for example regulations related to allowability of compensation costs counterfeit parts specialty metals and conflict minerals can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its various agencies such as the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these 

agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and internal policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions forfeiture of profits and suspension or debarment allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on certain of our contracts subject to these regulations upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems where appropriate we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns     

  

as with other government contractors the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws including the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards and we are subject from time to time to us government investigations relating to our operations if we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in the value of contracts contract modifications or terminations penalties fines compensatory treble or other damages or suspension or debarment any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require stateoftheart manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually have new technology that is supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems in developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule needed for construction the risk associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus to respond to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received 

  

we have experienced quality issues in the past with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies 

and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of consolidating all ingalls ship construction into our pascagoula shipyard and we may not recover all of our costs related to the wind down of shipbuilding at our avondale shipyard 

  

in october 2014 we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our avondale louisiana shipyard and consolidated all ingalls shipbuilding into our pascagoula shipyard we have shifted construction of future lpdclass ships to a single production line at our pascagoula shipyard to reduce costs increase efficiency and address shipbuilding overcapacity shifting avondales shipbuilding to our pascagoula shipyard may not result in our realization of anticipated benefits from serial production at that facility in connection with the increased utilization of our employees and facilities in our pascagoula shipyard we may encounter difficulties adhering to backtoback production schedules any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely perform our existing contracts and our ability to obtain new contracts in the future moreover the concentration of our ingalls workforce in pascagoula may inhibit our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled and trained employees to perform the increased workload any failure to attract and retain the necessary workforce or to effectively manage and control thirdparty contractors could adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have incurred substantial restructuring costs and asset writedowns currently estimated at 284 million  related to the wind down of our operations at avondale we believe that substantially all such expenses are recoverable under existing flexiblypriced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with far provisions governing the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs the dcaa prepared an initial audit report on our july 2010 cost recovery proposal of 310 million which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the dcaa to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately 25 million  or 8  of the costs included in the proposal we submitted a revised proposal in march 2014 to address the dcaa concerns and reflect a revised estimated total cost of 284 million  in july 2014 we received a letter from the supervisor of shipbuilding requesting that we revise our restructuring proposal to address certain documentation issues identified by the dcaa in order for the government to make an adequate evaluation of the restructuring proposal in august 2014 we received a letter from the supervisor of shipbuilding proposing a joint meeting regarding the treatment of specific costs included in the restructuring proposal and acknowledging that the allowability and allocability of costs will be determined by the government in an advanced agreement in accordance with far 

although closure is still the baseline assumption for avondale we are pursuing other opportunities to utilize this facility if we are successful in pursuing such opportunities and avondale remains open we would submit a revised restructuring proposal to the us navy consistent with this change in such event we expect that our total estimated restructuring costs would decrease while the restructuring costs that are currently capitalized consisting primarily of severance and retention payments as well as retired fixed assets should remain recoverable under existing or future us navy contracts other costs would remain as part of the avondale cost structure associated with avondales new line of business 

whether we close avondale entirely or keep the facility open in a new line of business we currently do not have an agreement with the us navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down at avondale we may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down such costs which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time could be significant the actual restructuring expenses we incur in connection with our wind down of avondale including potential environmental costs may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and 

technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our assumptions on ship contracts include the length of time to complete the contract because total costs include expected increases in wages and material prices similarly our assumptions include the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts we consider incentives awards and penalties related to contract performance in estimating revenues and profit rates and we record them when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance 

the judgment and estimation processes described above are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant natural disasters can disrupt our facilities systems or projects which can interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position  in this section  

  

natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of 11 collective bargaining agreements and two doe site stabilization agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in july 2017 august 2018 and december 2018 newport news craft workers employed at the kesselring site near saratoga springs new york are represented under an indefinite doe site agreement ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which all expire in march 2018 craft employees at our waggaman louisiana location are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in june 2019 approximately 90 craft employees of sn3 are represented under two collective bargaining agreements expiring in february 2015 and september 2017 or under a doe site agreement for those working at the hanford washington site 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and we must negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties with renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings equity and contributions to our pension and retiree health care plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm returns on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding of the plans 

timing differences exist between the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap pension funding requirements and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards cas board issued its final cas harmonization rule the new rule impacts pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns or other actions commonly referred to as green initiatives we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions 

  

shipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked 

and required remediation in the past in addition our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes substantial fines penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

in addition to fines penalties and criminal sanctions environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases we incur and expect to incur in the future costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we ceased shipbuilding construction at our louisiana facilities in 2014 our wind down of operations at these facilities may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial agreements 

  

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we sometimes access these markets to support certain business activities including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects obtaining credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program refinancing existing indebtedness and arranging for letters of credit depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

tightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers and subcontractors ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers or subcontractors ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to perform our contracts the inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be liquidated upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and extensive compliance controls policies procedures and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials the protection of export controlled or classified information cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we may not however prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees agents or business partners and the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions any improper actions could subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities or other disruptions could expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities our nuclear operations at doe sites and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the situation in addition new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities that we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses we make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments in determining acquisition prices which prices must be allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common stock can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as of december 31 2014  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 16  and 9  respectively of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate purchased intangibles when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangibles 

after conducting the 2014 goodwill impairment test we determined that goodwill at our other segment was impaired by 47 million  the other segment established in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition of upi is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry the goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by the recent drop in oil prices and the resulting decrease in industry market multiples we determined that the estimated fair value of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2014  

  

adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income the examination of 

previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and have returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures 

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture projects and internal controls relating to such projects these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

in pursuing our business strategies we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses our financial results business and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges liabilities amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of purchased intangible assets 

  

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position 

  

the size type and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are currently and may in the future become subject to various administrative civil or criminal litigation environmental claims income tax matters compliance matters claims and investigations which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines penalties compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations litigation claims or investigations if ultimately resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation claims or investigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own certain patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties the us government generally holds licenses to certain 

intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property more recently we believe the us government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property the us governments efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment our intellectual property is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other measures these agreements and other measures may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights breach of a confidentiality agreement or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors if we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2014  we had 1700 million  of debt and 650 million  of additional borrowing and letter of credit capacity under our credit facility credit facility our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 

because we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our debt moreover despite our current level of debt we may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

restrictive covenants in the indentures governing our senior notes and our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the indenture governing our 7125 senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 25 

 

the indenture governing our 5000 senior notes limits our ability among other things to 

 

in addition the indenture governing our 7125 senior notes requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the terms of our credit facility limit the amount of our capital expenditures and require us to maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio among others these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit our strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes these covenants limit how we may conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs these covenants may therefore limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business 

our spinoff from northrop grumman exposes us to potential liabilities including us federal income tax liabilities 

  

our spinoff from northrop grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that northrop grumman northrop grummans stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except with respect to cash received by northrop grummans stockholders in lieu of fractional shares if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction northrop grumman would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under irs regulations each member of northrop grummans consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff northrop grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the respective business or businesses that we own and operate following the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to northrop grumman such as certain tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if northrop grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform its allocated obligations 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy consequently the us navy has required us to include in our contracts with the navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights in the event of change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear work for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navys ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work 

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory treble or other damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges any suspension or debarment would likely have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on us navy and us coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we are providing information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million  in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy has reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million  to 47 million  while expressing its view that the gross amount of potential mischarging incurred by the navy will likely not exceed 31 million  the us coast guard informed us in june 2014 that it was provisionally reducing its withhold from 58 million  to 36 million  based on the results of our internal investigation we estimate that the maximum amount of the mischarging is approximately 4 million  we are in discussions with our us government customers regarding the potential release of an additional portion of the withheld funds but we cannot predict whether these customers will agree to a lower withhold amount depending upon the us governments assessment of the matters under investigation we could be subject to significant civil penalties criminal fines and suspension or debarment from us government contracting although we do not currently believe that this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new information might come to light in the future and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

litigation  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business although we believe that the resolution of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters 

  

in 2013 we resolved litigation against an insurance provider factory mutual insurance company fm global arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina in january 2011 we through a predecessorininterest filed suit in superior court in california against aon risk insurance services west inc aon which acted as broker to our predecessorininterest in connection with the insurance policy with fm global seeking damages for breach of contract professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation as well as declaratory relief those damages include over 200 million in damages unrecovered from fm global plus costs legal fees and expenses incurred in the lawsuit against fm global as well as interest in january 2014 we amended our complaint to allege fraud and seek punitive damages no assurances can be provided as to the ultimate outcome of the matter if however the claims are successful the potential impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows would be favorable 

in january 2011 the us department of justice doj first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint we received alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means northrop grumman and we obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million  plus penalties attorneys fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

  

in july 2012 the district court entered an order permitting the company to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint received by the company including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the doj to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint 

was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes on december 8 2011 the doj filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case on february 28 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia granted the defendants motion to transfer venue and the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of mississippi we have filed a motion to dismiss the case and a motion to disqualify relator holmes and all other matters are stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss 

based upon a review to date of the information available to us we believe that we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts and that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit we therefore believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we intend to defend the matter vigorously but we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

  

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation 

we and our predecessorininterest have been in litigation with the bolivarian republic of venezuela the “republic” since 2002 over a contract for the repair refurbishment and modernization at ingalls of two foreignbuilt frigates the case proceeded towards arbitration then appeared to settle favorably but the settlement was overturned in court and the matter returned to litigation in march 2014 we filed an arbitral statement of claim asserting breaches of the contract and 173 million  in damages plus substantial interest and litigation expenses in july 2014 the republic filed in the arbitration a statement of defense denying all our allegations and a counterclaim alleging late redelivery of the frigates unfinished work and breach of warranty and asserting damages of 61 million  plus interest an arbitration hearing was held in january 2015 no assurances can be provided regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter

overview 

our business 

for more than a century we have designed built overhauled and repaired ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard we conduct business primarily with the us government principally the department of defense dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs hii is organized into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and other through our ingalls segment we are a builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters nsc for the us coast guard and one of only two companies that builds the navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers through our newport news segment we are the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy our other segment was established in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the budget control act the bca reduced the dod top line budget by 487 billion from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and 1013 trillion for fiscal year 2015 

enactment of the bipartisan budget act enabled the house and senate appropriations committees to agree upon appropriations levels across the 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2015 including defense appropriations and homeland security and to subsequently pass the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act for fiscal year 2015 the fy 2015 act however the homeland security department including the us coast guard remains under a fiscal year 2014 continuing resolution until february 27 2015 in order to support consideration by the 114th congress of fiscal year 2015 funding levels regarding immigration activities 

the fy 2015 act specifically provided funding for procurement of cvn79 john f kennedy  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines advance procurement for the cvn73 uss george washington  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production and advance procurement for lha7 tripoli  the fy 2015 act also provided 1 billion for the procurement of an additional lpd17 san antonio class ship and rdte funding for the ohio  replacement program 

while the bipartisan budget act eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 significant uncertainty exists regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2016 through 2021 and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs 

the fiscal year 2016 presidents budget request was delivered in early february 2015 the ability of congress to pass a fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the homeland security department as well as the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates for fiscal year 2016 and beyond remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts other defense spending cuts or the prospective lack of a fiscal year 2015 homeland security appropriations bill may have on funding for our individual programs 

longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding which would adversely affect our future sales under such programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations and peacekeeping we believe the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in march 2014 the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr built upon the 2012 defense strategic guidance prioritizing three strategic pillars defending the homeland building security globally by projecting us influence and deterring aggression and remaining prepared to win decisively against any adversary should deterrence fail guided by this updated defense strategy dod plans to rebalance the military over the next decade and put it on a sustainable path to protect and advance us interests and sustain us global leadership 

we expect that dod execution of its strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while facing additional major budget cuts that began in 2013 while the bipartisan budget act established new budget caps and provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 defense and nondefense discretionary programs the administration continues to consider how sequestration could impact programs for 2016 and beyond and the outcome of that assessment could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

in june 2014 the us navy released its 2015 shipbuilding plan which anticipates a fleet of 306 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 33 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 33 support vessels the 2015 shipbuilding plan also notes that the four ssgn currently in service will retire in the mid2020s and the us navy is exploring the possibility of inserting a quadpack of large diameter payload tubes in block v ssn774 virginia class submarines to offset the loss of the ssgn strike capability the 2015 shipbuilding plan also acknowledges that the dod will encounter several challenges in executing the plan particularly with regard to funding new submarines to replace the ohio class nuclear ballistic submarines significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is anticipated that the us navy will submit a shipbuilding plan to congress subsequent to submission of the fiscal year 2016 presidents budget request which will provide additional details regarding the force structure 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the 

us navys new lcs the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices requirements criteria and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control the most recent initiatives are organized into eight major areas achieve affordable programs achieve dominant capabilities while controlling lifecycle costs incentivize productivity in industry and government incentivize innovation in industry and government eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy promote effective competition improve tradecraft in acquisition of services and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce while the impact to our business resulting from these initiatives remains uncertain they could have a material impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities with the dod see risks related to our business in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate most of our revenues from longterm us government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these areas it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  most of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we have other types of contracts such as services or commercial arrangements for which revenues are recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured costs related to these contracts are expensed as incurred we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2014  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program the legend class nsc program the lpd17  san antonio class program including delivered lpd ships and the construction contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  during the same period none of the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were individually significant 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and risk retirement on the legend class nsc program for the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the closing of our gulfport facility costs and delays on lha6 america associated with the remediation of mechanical issues identified during testing as well as unfavorable performance on lpd25 somerset including costs and delays associated with repairing damage caused by underwater debris during preparation for sea trials 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily the result of risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise  edsra as well as the receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party for the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to higher than expected costs to complete lpd24 uss arlington as well as increased workers compensation expense driven by discount rates 

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first 

against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

other considerations  defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan retirement related benefit plans benefit costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon cas the cas requirements for retirement related benefit plans costs differ from the financial accounting standards fas requirements given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the cas and fas requirements to determine specific recoverability we have not estimated the incremental fas income or expense recoverable under our expected future contract activity and therefore did not defer any fas expense for retirement related benefit plans the difference between fas and cas is therefore recorded as period income or expense within general and administrative expenses this resulted in a cas cost in excess of fas expense of 72 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  and fas expense in excess of cas cost of 61 million  and 80 million  for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill as of december 31 2014  and 2013  was 1026 million  and 881 million  respectively 

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2014  impairment test  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2014  and determined that goodwill at our other segment was impaired by 47 million  the other segment established in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition of upi is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry the goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by the recent drop in oil prices and the resulting decrease in industry market multiples we determined that the estimated fair value of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30 2014  

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were 22 million  and 25 million  respectively and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2014  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

the cash funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below different funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code among various items we consider both the minimum funding requirements and the funded status of each plan from the perspective of potential benefit restrictions in developing our contribution schedule in a given year and we may make additional discretionary contributions beyond minimum funding requirements 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to lower levels over the next few years the enactment of highway and transportation funding act “hatfa” in 2014 provided for the continuation of higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the phaseout period we consider the effects of legislation such as map21 and hafta in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding on the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

we record cas retirement related benefits cost in the results of our business segments and we include the fas expense for these benefits in total operating income under gaap due to the differences between fas and cas amounts we also present the difference between fas expense and cas cost referred to as our fascas adjustment to reconcile segment operating income to total operating income on a consolidated basis under gaap due to the foregoing differences in requirements and calculation methodologies our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflect the effects of the rule harmonization affects pension costs on contracts with initial effects beginning in 2013 our recoverable cas pension costs allocable to our contracts increased in 2014 and we expect recoveries to continue to increase during the phasein period ending in 2017 our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions offered under map21 and hatfa because of the permitted method we use to determine the interest rate under harmonization 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 434  and 527  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 422  and 503  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year since 2013 we have used a 750 expected longterm rate of return assumption to record pension expense we will continue to use this 750 assumption for recording 2015 fas pension expense we assess this assumption at least annually 

mortality   mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical and projected longevity experience we periodically assess the reasonableness of our mortality assumptions as of december 31 2014 we updated our mortality assumptions to reflect our recent mortality experience and the anticipated effects of future mortality improvements the effect of the changes in the mortality assumptions increased our december 31 2014 pension related benefit obligations by approximately 54 million or 1 the impact on other postretirement benefits was not material the increase was treated as an actuarial loss and subject to amortization in future periods as described below we anticipate reflecting updated mortality assumptions in our 2015 cas costs if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions could be affected 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants which is approximately 10 years in 2014  the actual return on assets was approximately 101 which was higher than the expected return assumption of 750 for the year ended december 31 2014  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 93 and 81 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in a combined net actuarial loss of approximately 644 million 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

cas cost  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the discount rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality bonds when harmonization is fully phased in the greater of the two liabilities will be used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization the four year phase in period commencing in 2014 requires the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities we expect our allocable cas costs to increase under harmonization as the regulation was intended  

other fas and cas considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the employees average future service life of approximately 10 years under cas net gains and losses were amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under harmonization the amortization period for cas changed to 10 years for gains and losses experienced beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically spread over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this spreading method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expenses accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent gains and losses faster than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly we update our estimates of future fas expense and cas cost at least annually based on factors such as actual calendar year plan asset returns actual census data and other actual and projected experience 

the fascas adjustment in 2014  was a net benefit of 72 million  compared to a net expense of 61 million  in 2013  the favorable  change was driven by lower fas expense due primarily to higher discount rates and plan assets at the end of 2013 the full year effect of the 2013 postretirement benefits amendment and the phasein of harmonization   the fascas adjustment in 2013  was a net expense of 61 million  compared to a net expense of 80 million  in 2012  the favorable  change was driven by increased cas cost partially offset by increased fas expense the increase in fas expense was due primarily to commencing the amortization in 2013 of the net actuarial losses incurred in 2012 partially offset by the impact of the remeasurement in 2013 of our postretirement benefit plans our projection of the 2015 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds real estate investment funds collective trust funds and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent which are based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent for the very limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value 

accumulated other comprehensive income  we record in accumulated other comprehensive income unrecognized gains and losses as well as unrecognized prior service costs and credits arising from our retirement related plans as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized losses as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were 1447 million  and 897 million  respectively these net deferred losses primarily originated from changes in the discount rate differences between estimated and expected asset returns and changes in demographic assumptions and experience the increase in these losses in 2014  was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rates which accounted for 759 million offset by 115 million of 2014  actual asset returns being greater than expected and 52 million of amortization of previously unrecognized losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were 20 million  and 28 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2014  primarily resulted from amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits  

the amortization period for qualifying unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized gainslosses is the estimated remaining service lives of our employees which is approximately 10 years 

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans in addition to participating in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded 34 million in workers compensation expense due to a lower discount rate of 159 our workers compensation liability was discounted at 248  and 216  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 48 million and 58 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 846 million  and 792 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the following table 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business with the us government most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant 

changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consist of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

2014   product sales in 2014   decreased   89 million  or 2  from 2013  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 139 million in 2014  primarily due to lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants newport news product sales increased 50 million in 2014  as a result of higher volumes in submarines and energy partially offset by lower volumes in aircraft carriers 

service revenues in 2014   increased   226 million  or 22  from 2013  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 15 million in 2014  as a result of lower volumes in amphibious assault ships and surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 104 million in 2014  primarily as a result of the acquisition of sn3 as well as higher volumes in aircraft carriers services partially offset by lower volumes in fleet support services service revenues at our other segment were 137 million in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of upi 

2013   product sales in 2013   increased   46 million  or 1  from 2012  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 80 million in 2013  primarily due to lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants newport news product sales increased 126 million in 2013  as a result of higher volumes in aircraft carriers and submarines 

service revenues in 2013   increased   66 million  or 7  from 2012  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 10 million in 2013  due to lower volumes in surface combatants services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 76 million in 2013  primarily due to higher volumes in fleet support and aircraft carrier services 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2014   cost of product sales in 2014   decreased   206 million  or 4  compared to 2013  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 236 million in 2014  primarily due to performance improvement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and the lower sales volumes described above cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 30 million in 2014  primarily due to higher sales volumes described above and yeartoyear variances in contract mix cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined  from 809  in 2013  to 786  in 2014  primarily driven by performance improvement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and risk retirement on the legend class nsc program 

2013   cost of product sales in 2013   decreased   132 million  or 3  compared to 2012  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 180 million in 2013  primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries and lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 48 million in 2013  primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers partially offset by lower costs on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by performance improvement and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined from 839  in 2012  to 809  in 2013  primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes as well as risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 

cost of service revenues   

2014   cost of service revenues in 2014   increased   163 million  or 18  compared to 2013  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 20 million in 2014  consistent with the volume changes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 61 million in 2014  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above partially offset by the impact of a change in our contract mix following the acquisition of sn3 cost of service revenues at our other segment were 122 million in 2014  primarily resulting from the acquisition of upi cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined  from 871  in 2013  to 844  in 2014  due to yeartoyear variances in contract mix primarily resulting from the acquisition of sn3 

2013    cost of service revenues in 2013   increased   86 million  or 11  compared to 2012  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 10 million in 2013  as a result of the lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 96 million in 2013  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from 842  in 2012  to 871  in 2013  primarily due to the favorable resolution in 2012 of outstanding contract changes as well as normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2014   income from operating investments net decreased   3 million  or 21  to 11 million  in 2014  from 14 million  in 2013  the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2013    income from operating investments net decreased   4 million  or 22  to 14 million  in 2013  from 18 million  in 2012  the decrease was a result of reduced work funded by the american reinvestment and recovery act at our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2014   general and administrative expenses in 2014   decreased   13 million  or 2  compared to 2013  this decrease was primarily the result of a favorable change in the fascas adjustment partially offset by increases resulting from the amortization of avondale restructuring costs the inclusion of upi and sn3 and higher state tax expense 

2013    general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2013  compared to 2012  this was primarily the result of favorable variances in deferred state tax expense and the fascas adjustment offsetting increases in current state tax expense legal expenses and bid and proposal efforts 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for 

goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to 

operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2014    we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 of 47 million  in our other segment see note 12 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

2013    we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2013 

2012    we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2012 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income which is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use segment operating income in addition to and not as an alternative for total operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap it is a metric that we use to evaluate our core operating performance we believe that segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we believe the measure is used by investors and is a 

useful indicator to measure our performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



segment operating income 

2014   segment operating income in 2014  was 585 million  compared to 567 million  in 2013  the increase  was primarily due to performance improvement and risk retirement on the lpd17  san antonio class program and the legend class nsc program as well as the unfavorable impact in the prior year of the gulfport facility closure partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge described above and the favorable impact in the prior year of hurricane insurance recoveries 

2013   segment operating income in 2013  was 567 million  compared to 457 million  in 2012  the increase  was primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes as well as risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 partially offset by the impact of closing our gulfport facility and the favorable resolution in 2012 of outstanding contract changes 

activity within each segment is discussed in segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2014   the fascas adjustment in 2014  was a net benefit of 72 million  compared to a net expense of 61 million  in 2013  the favorable  change was driven by lower fas expense due primarily to higher discount rates and plan assets at the end of 2013 the full year effect of the 2013 postretirement benefits amendment and the phasein of harmonization 

2013   the fascas adjustment in 2013  was a net expense of 61 million  compared to a net expense of 80 million  in 2012  the favorable  change was driven by increased cas cost partially offset by increased fas expense the increase in fas expense was due primarily to commencing the amortization in 2013 of the net actuarial losses incurred in 2012 partially offset by the impact of the remeasurement in 2013 of our postretirement benefit plans 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2015  to be a net benefit of approximately 111 million primarily driven by the continued phasein of harmonization favorable 2014 asset returns and a partial offset due to lower fas discount rates the expected fascas adjustment is subject to update during 2015  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with final 2014  asset returns and census data and other items such as a plan amendment that might trigger a remeasurement during 2015  

deferred state income taxes 

deferred state income taxes reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income while the current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2014   the deferred state income tax expense  in 2014  was 2 million  compared to a benefit  of 6 million  in 2013  this change was primarily attributable to nonrecurring adjustments related to establishing a valuation allowance for a state tax loss carryforward and the trueup of 2013 deferred taxes these increases were partially offset by changes in the timing of contract taxable income and reserves that are not currently deductible for tax purposes 

2013   the deferred state income taxes benefit  in 2013  was 6 million  compared to an expense  of 19 million  in 2012  this change was primarily attributable to the recognition of previously deferred tax losses on contracts which increased 2012 deferred state tax expense deferred state taxes in 2013 were favorably impacted by pension related changes and increases in reserves 

interest expense 

2014   interest expense in 2014  was 149 million  compared to 118 million  in 2013  the increase  was primarily a result of a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 see note 14 debt 

2013   interest expense remained relatively constant in 2013  at 118 million  compared to 117 million  in 2012  

federal income taxes   

2014    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 333  in 2014  compared to 338  in 2013  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by the amount of the goodwill impairment that is not deductible for tax purposes 

2013   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 338  in 2013  compared to 394  in 2012  the 2012 tax rate included the impact of an 8 million unfavorable noncash tax adjustment arising under the tax matters agreement with northrop grumman which requires indemnification between us and northrop grumman for aggregate tax adjustments exceeding a certain threshold for periods prior to the spinoff see note 13 income taxes in item 8 excluding this adjustment the effective tax rate for 2012 was 361 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and enactment of the american taxpayer relief act in january 2013 which retroactively extended the research and development tax credit through the end of 2013 our effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the entire 2012 income tax benefit for the research and development tax credit which expired at the end of 2011 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into three reportable segments ingalls newport news and other we established the other segment in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our nonshipbuilding commercial activities in the first quarter of 2014 we realigned our segments in order to optimize our operating structure as a result of this realignment our amsec and continental maritime of san diego cmsd businesses were transferred from the ingalls segment to the newport news segment we have reflected the 2014 realignment in prior financial reporting periods on an asif basis which has resulted in the transfer of revenue operating profit assets and liabilities between the ingalls and newport news segments none of these changes impacted our previously reported consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on may 30 2014 we completed the acquisition of upi we report the postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows of upi as part of our other segment on january 2 2014 we completed the acquisition of sn3 sn3s postacquisition results of operations financial position and cash flows are reported within our newport news segment 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls

other

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2014  was approximately 21 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2014  and 2013  



we expect approximately 28  of the 21 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2014  to be converted into sales in 2015  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2014  and 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  as classified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2014   cash provided by  operating activities was 716 million  in 2014  compared to 236 million  in 2013  the increase  of 480 million  was due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable and retirement benefit funding in 2014  we paid net cash of 161 million  for federal and state income taxes 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2015  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2013   cash provided by  operating activities was 236 million  in 2013  compared to 332 million  in 2012  the decrease  of 96 million  was due primarily to increases in income tax payments and retirement benefit funding within trade working capital higher inventoried costs and accounts receivable were offset by higher income taxes payable and accounts payable and accruals in 2013  we paid net cash of 154 million  for federal and state income taxes 

investing activities 

2014   cash used in  investing activities was 437 million  in 2014  an increase  of 356 million  from 2013  this increase in cash used in investing activities was driven by the acquisitions of sn3 and upi for 2015  we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment excluding discretionary projects to be approximately 2 of annual revenues 

2013   cash used in  investing activities was 81 million  in 2013  a decrease  of 81 million  from 2012  this decrease was driven by proceeds from hurricane insurance recoveries and lower capital expenditures in 2013 

financing activities 

2014   cash used in  financing activities in 2014  was 332 million  compared to 169 million   used in   2013  the increase was primarily due to an additional 66 million of debt related expenditures 24 million of cash dividend payments and 19 million of repurchases of common stock in addition to 64 million in employee tax withholdings on sharebased payment arrangements in 2014  compared to 2013  

2013   cash used in  financing activities in 2013  was 169 million  compared to 28 million   used in   2012  the increase was primarily due to an additional 118 million of repurchases of common stock 22 million of debt repayments and 20 million of cash dividend payments partially offset by 24 million of excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation in 2013 compared to 2012 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we believe free cash flow is an important measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and periodtoperiod performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2014   free cash flow increased 454 million  from 2013  due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable and retirement benefit funding partially offset by increased capital expenditures in 2014 

2013   free cash flow decreased 73 million  from 2012  due primarily to increases in income tax payments and retirement benefit funding partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2013 

retirement related plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under pension relief defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including attainment of the funded percentage needed to avoid benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the 

plans funded status if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes our pension contributions could be affected we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



we made minimum and discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 123 million  301 million  and 236 million  in the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our qualified pension plans were funded 86 and 93 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2014  and 2013  these plans were considered at least 90 funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to develop respective obligations for these two different purposes we expect our 2015  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 99 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 33 million  38 million  and 31 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we expect our 2015  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 36 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis

national security cutter 

  

the us coast guards recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline the flagship of this program is the legend class nsc a multimission platform we designed and built the us coast guard ordered the first three nsc vessels from integrated coast guard systems icgs a joint venture between lockheed martin and us pursuant to an indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq contract for the deepwater modernization program the first national security cutter nsc1 uscgc bertholf  was delivered to the us coast guard in 2008 followed by nsc2 uscgc waesche  in 2009 and nsc3 uscgc stratton  in 2011 beginning in 2010 with the construction contract for nsc4 hamilton  the nsc contracts have been awarded directly to ingalls nsc4 hamilton  and nsc5  james are currently under construction ingalls was awarded a construction contract for nsc6 munro  in 2013 

fleet support amsec and continental maritime of san diego cmsd 

  

fleet support provides comprehensive life cycle services including depot maintenance modernization repairs logistics and technical support and planning yard services for naval and commercial vessels through our amsec and cmsd subsidiaries we have ship repair facilities in newport news virginia and san diego california which are near the us navys largest homeports of norfolk virginia and san diego respectively amsec provides naval architecture and marine engineering ship system assessments maintenance engineering and logistics services to the us navy and commercial maritime industry from 27 locations across the globe on any given day over 600 of our amsec employees are on board us navy ships assessing equipment conditions modernizing systems and training sailors through cmsd a master ship repair contractor we provide ship repair regular overhaul and selected restricted availability services pier side or in customers dry docks for the us navy we also perform emergent repair for the us navy on all classes of ships beginning in 2014 fleet support including amsec and cmsd was reorganized as part of our newport news operating segment 

newport news 

the capabilities of our newport news operations extend from our core business of designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships to our secondary businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operation management and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through department of energy doe programs our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities that include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock and a 1050ton gantry crane capable of servicing two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction and refueling and complex overhaul of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to our operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons newport news has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the us navy since 1933 including all ten ships currently in active service 

  

we delivered the us navys newest carrier and the last of the cvn68 nimitz class cvn77 uss george hw bush  in 2009 we have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier the cvn78 gerald r ford class for over ten years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class cvn78 gerald r ford  which is scheduled for delivery in 2016 we also received awards in 2009 through 2013 totaling 20 billion under a construction preparation contract for the second cvn78 gerald r ford class aircraft carrier cvn79 john f kennedy  this contract includes design planning procurement of longleadtime materials and limited fabrication as well as continued research and development with key suppliers 

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes over three years to complete and the work accounts for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers 50 year service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and onsite fleet repair work 

we completed the rcoh for cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  and redelivered it to the us navy in 2013 we have also received awards totaling 26 billion under an execution contract for the rcoh of cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers as well as the fact that rcoh work requires a highly trained workforce is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly positions us for the award of future rcoh contracts on the current and future us navy aircraft carrier fleet 

  

aircraft carrier inactivation 

  

the us navy awarded us a 745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate cvn65 uss enterprise  the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 with a scheduled redelivery date in 2016 aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as those we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation we believe that the us navy will require inactivation of aircraft carriers in the naval fleet as they reach the end of their lifespans and we intend to be positioned as the best choice to be awarded that work 

  

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy newport news has delivered 58  submarines to the us navy since 1960 comprised of 44  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 54 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 26 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build ssn774 virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines alternate between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and the six submarines of the second block of ssn774 virginia class submarines have been delivered in december 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight ssn774 virginia class submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year from 2011 through 2013 the eighth submarine to be procured under this contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019 

ssbnx ohioclass replacement program 

  

the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2013 states the us navys intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic and cruise missile submarines the us navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the ssbn ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 we are currently participating in the design effort and our experience and specialized workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort but no decisions have been made regarding that aspect of the program the ssbn ohio class includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the ohio  replacement program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15year period at a cost of approximately 4 billion to 7 billion each the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to electric boat congress has delayed the start of the first ohio  replacement submarine by two years and construction is now expected to begin in 2021 with procurement of longleadtime materials in 2017 and delivery in 2030 the first ohio class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2027 with an additional submarine being retired each year thereafter by 2030 the ohio class ballistic missile submarine fleet is expected to be down to ten the current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may cause additional delay to the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured but we believe the ohio  replacement program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future 

  

energy 

  

our doe and commercial nuclear programs leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations program management and heavy manufacturing we selectively partner with experienced industry leaders and we are a participant in one active joint venture we are also able through our subsidiary newport news industrial corporation nni to provide a range of services to the energy industry as well as government customers 

savannah river nuclear solutions llc srns 

  

in january 2008 srns our joint venture with fluor federal services inc and honeywell international inc was awarded a fiveyear 4 billion contract for site management and operations at the does savannah river site located 12 miles south of aiken south carolina work at the site includes management of a national laboratory and the cleanup of nuclear waste both newly generated and backlogged and legacy wastes that exist at various facilities throughout the savannah river site as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 srns was awarded a 14 billion contract to deactivate and remediate several reactors and sites at the savannah river site in september 2012 the doe exercised its option to extend the original contract for another three years bringing the total contract value to approximately 8 billion we have a 34  ownership stake in srns 

newport news industrial corporation

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 8 segment information in item 8 

customers 

revenues from the us government accounted for substantially all of our revenues in 2013  2012  and 2011  in 2013  2012  and 2011  app roximately 94 96 and 97 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 6 4 and 3 re spectively were generated from the us coast guard 

intellectual property 

with approximately 5000 engineers and designers we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs contract cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  our total backlog was approximately 18 billion  and 16 billion  respectively approximately 32  of  backlog at december 31 2013  is expected to be converted into sales in 2014  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source however due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our future needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 22 million  21 million  and 24 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it has a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic benefits the us navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risks related to our business in item 1a 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by a government customer or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties as well as administrative sanctions 

which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension and prohibition from doing business with the us government 

the us government has the ability pursuant to regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significa nt deficiencies exist in one or more such systems the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on contracts subject to these regulations upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns 

  

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not for the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in 2009 congress passed legislation to improve the organization and procedures of the dod for the acquisition of major weapons systems including shipbuilding and maritime systems this legislation the weapon system acquisition reform act of 2009 requires the dod to develop mechanisms to address cost schedule and performance in establishing program requirements as acquisition reform progresses we will continue to monitor the actions of the pentagon and congress to determine their impact on our operations and respond appropriately 

  

government contractors must comply with a significant volume of procurement regulations and other requirements contracting with the us government may result in our filing of requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible reas are prepared submitted and negotiated in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the reas are not satisfactory 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to additional procurement regulations that include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by any one agency may result in fines penalties or debarment or suspension from contracting with all us government agencies 

competition 

we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which may team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in the market because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and defueling the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities in this regard the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 2012 act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 2013 act modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law 

we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are also the sole supplier of nscs for the us coast guard and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers we are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us   environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations can cause our estimated costs to change 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we record environmental remediation accruals at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of december 31 2013  our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately 2 million  which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of military shipbuilding at avondale these costs are not reasonably estimable at this time however due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 2 million  accrual for environmental remediation costs or our 256 million  estimate of avondale asset writedowns and restructuring costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant portion of any future environmental remediation costs we incur at avondale would be recoverable consistent with government accounting practices under the federal acquisition regulation far 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives we have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws we expect however to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time however we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experienced three industrial related fatalities in the pa st seven years  we strive to keep our occupational safety  health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work since then our gulfport mississippi and cmsd facilities have also been certified as osha vpp star sites 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 38000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration shipbuilding employees we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades approximately 5000 engineers and designers and approximately 2400 employees with advanced degrees employees who have been with us or our predecessor companies for over 40 years achieve the title of master shipbuilder as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 1100 master shipbuilders approximately 850 at newport news and approximately 250 at ingalls we employ more than 5500 veterans 

our newport news apprentice school trains approximately 800 apprentices each year in 19 crafts and trades and several advanced programs our ingalls apprentice school currently has approximately 300 registered apprentices in its programs apprentices are paid as fulltime employees for the duration of their studies and usually continue to work with us upon graduation from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 2900 alumni of the apprentice school at newport news and approximately 1900 alumni of our ingalls apprentice school continue to work with us 

approximately 50  of our approximately 38000   employees are covered by a total of nine  collective bargaining agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in april 2014 june 2014 and july 2017 ingalls has six collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees five of which cover pascagoula and gulfport employees and one of which covers avondale employees the five pascagoulagulfport collective bargaining agreements expire in march 2015 the avondale collective bargaining agreement was indefinitely extended upon its last expiration we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

risks related to our business 

  

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers ability to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business is primarily dependent upon the design construction repair maintenance fleet support and life cycle services of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues in 2013  were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition substantially all of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2013  we are a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us   government and its agencies the related contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work delays in the timing of contract approval and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

contracts with the us government are subject to uncertain levels of funding modification due to changes in customer priorities and potential termination 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the us   navy and the us coast guard the funding of us   government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and may receive additional funding only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process in continuing resolutions or in individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers in august 2011 the budget control act the bca reduced the dod topline budget by 487 billion from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard 

on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2013 the bipartisan budget act which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and 1013 trillion for fiscal year 2015 sequestration remains in effect under the bca for fiscal years 2016 through 2021 enactment of the bipartisan budget act enabled the house and senate appropriations committees to agree upon appropriations levels across all 12 appropriations committees including defense appropriations and homeland security 

appropriations and to subsequently pass the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 the fy 2014 act 

the fy 2014 act specifically provided funding for the advance construction of cvn79 john f kennedy  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines continuation of the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production and cost to complete for lha6 america  the fy 2014 act also fully funded construction of nsc7 kimball  and provided funding for nsc8 midgett  longleadtime material 

while the bipartisan budget act eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 significant uncertainty exists regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2016 through 2021 and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs 

delivery of the fiscal year 2015 presidents budget request has been deferred until early march 2014 the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts other defense spending cuts or the prospective lack of a fiscal year 2015 defense appropriations bill may have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding which would adversely affect our future sales under such programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

demand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to military transformation and planning or the nature of war related activity we cannot predict the impact of such changes on existing followon or replacement programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us   government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us   governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit related to those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating contract costs reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance or product quality issues performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our ability to recover   the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us   government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us   government and us the us   government is liable for its share of 

allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us   government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls   revenues in 2013  approximately 79  were generated from fpi contracts approximately 10  were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 8  were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 3  were generated from ffp contracts of newport news 2013  revenues approximately 45  were generated from cpif contracts which primarily included aircraft carrier construction and rcoh contracts approximately 31  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 23  were generated from fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction contracts and approximately 1  were generated from ffp contracts to the extent our mix of contract types change in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected 

  

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if actual events differ significantly from one or more of our assumptions or projections or if we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers we are subject to potential delivery disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us   government contracts to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in addition significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain raw materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us   government due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry there are currently certain components for which only one supplier exists the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component in a timely or costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our results of operations depend on awards of new contracts 

  

the prospects of us   shipyards including ours are materially affected by their success in securing significant us   navy contract awards in february 2006 the us navy presented to congress a goal of achieving and maintaining a fleet of 313 ships each year the us navy presents to congress the navys annual report to congress on longrange plan for construction of naval vessels the shipbuilding plan which includes the navys shipbuilding plan for the next five years and a longrange projection of new ship construction for the 

following 25 years the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2013 the 2013 shipbuilding plan included a fleet goal of 310 to 316 ships down from the fleet goal of 328 ships included in the navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2012 the 2012 shipbuilding plan and the procurement of 268 ships over the next 30 years down from the 275ship procurement included in the 2012 shipbuilding plan 

the dod released in january 2012 the defense strategic guidance a new set of strategic military priorities and guidance in may 2013 the us navy released its annual long range plan for the construction of naval vessels for 2014 the 2014 long range plan the 2014 long range plan anticipates a fleet of 306 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 33 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 33 support vessels the 2014 long range plan also notes that the four ssgn currently in service will retire in the mid2020s and the us navy is exploring the possibility of inserting a quadpack of large diameter payload tubes in block v ssn774 virginia class submarines to offset the loss of the ssgn strike capability the 2014 long range plan also acknowledges that the dod will encounter several challenges in executing the plan particularly with regard to funding new submarines to replace the ohio class nuclear ballistic submarines significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we believe our shipbuilding programs are a high priority for national defense but under federal budgetary pressures one or more of our programs may be reduced extended or terminated by our us   government customers specific actions that could negatively affect us include the deferral of production of new amphibious ships the reduction in the number of planned large surface combatants an increase in the procurement interval for aircraft carriers beyond five years and postponement or cancellation of the rcoh for cvn73 uss  george washington   in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in a decreased need for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2013  our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 41  of our consolidated revenue significant reductions in congressional appropriations for our shipbuilding programs or significant delays in such appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the department of defense has announced plans for significant changes to its business practices that could have a material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

in november 2010 the dod announced certain initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors these initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy our understanding is that these initiatives are intended to reduce costs and enhance efficiencies and productivity 

in november 2012 the dod expanded its focus on business process improvements by introducing better buying power 20 bbp 20 which established higher standards and stronger professional qualification requirements for key leadership positions in the acquisition workforce and increased the cost consciousness of the acquisition workforce bbp 20 also includes initiatives focused on enforcing affordability caps controlling costs through cost performance measures encouraging stronger partnerships with the requirements community and incentivizing industry by aligning profitability more tightly with dod goals and employing appropriate contract types in april 2013 the dod issued an implementation directive for bbp 20 which contained several of the key overarching principles that underlie bbp 20 including effective incentives to industry especially competitive pressures insistence on demonstrated progress before major commitments and use of the right contract type for the job   in november 2013 the dod also embarked upon an assessment to perform a costbenefit analysis of regulatory and statutory requirements that might be implemented more effectively changed or eliminated 

we expect dods focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod we are taking steps internally to assess how we can respond to and support these changes including how we can further reduce costs and increase productivity modify how we respond to proposals and revise our areas of focus depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

  

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must develop and sustain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose future contracts to our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of engineers and skilled workers at competitive costs and with the necessary skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts and attracting new business 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

us defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict while the us navys 2014 long range plan anticipates a fleet size of 306 ships the plan does not include enough ships to fully support all elements of the navys ships goal over the 30year period the us navy currently projects that shortfalls would occur at various points during this 30year period in ballistic missile submarines cruisersdestroyers attack submarines and amphibious ships declines in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build other of our products if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe that two existing us governmentowned shipyards could refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us   governmentowned shipyards engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of ssn688 los angeles class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships the 2012 national defense authorization act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2013 defense authorization act however modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was contained in previous law if a us governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the business of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services such competition increases the risk that we may not be the successful bidder on future us   navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and future surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have performed 

overcapacity in the us shipbuilding market may reduce our market share or our ability to secure contract awards at profitable prices 

the reduced level of shipbuilding activity by the us   navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 283 ships as of december 31 2013  has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which we own plus numerous other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels we intend to cease all military shipbuilding operations in our louisiana facilities in 2014 competition for future shipbuilding programs is expected to be intense additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each other as well as with other defense products and services future rationalization of shipyard capacity in the united states might occur and we could be affected by shipyard consolidation or closures as a result of the reduced level of us   navy spending on ship construction any further reduction could have a significant effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

us   government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements including procurement nuclear and other requirements government contracting requirements increase our contract performance and compliance costs our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs changes in regulations and related requirements can increase our compliance costs and reduce our profit margins 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us   government and its various agencies such as the us   navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and internal policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension and prohibition from doing business with the us   government allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability pursuant to regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems   the us government has in certain instances withheld payments on certain of our contracts subject to these regulations upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns     

  

as with other government contractors the us   government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices 

  

we must comply with a variety of federal laws including the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards and we are subject from time to time to us government investigations relating to our operations if we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in the value of contracts contract modifications or terminations the assessment of penalties and fines or compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such findings or convictions could also result in 

suspension or debarment from government contracting any suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require certain manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually have new technology that is supplied by the us   navy other contractors or us problems in developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in maintaining the design schedule needed for construction the risk associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received 

  

we have experienced quality issues in the past with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customers these issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits or may incur additional costs related to the wind down of military shipbuilding at our louisiana facilities and the consolidation of all ingalls construction into our pascagoula shipyard 

  

we intend to wind down military shipbuilding at our louisiana facilities including avondale our louisiana shipyard in 2014 and consolidate all ingalls military shipbuilding into our pascagoula shipyard we are shifting construction of future lpdclass ships to a single production line at our pascagoula shipyard to reduce costs increase efficiency and address shipbuilding overcapacity shifting avondale  s military shipbuilding to our pascagoula shipyard may not result in our realization of anticipated benefits from serial production at that facility in connection with the increased utilization of our employees and facilities in our pascagoula shipyard we may encounter difficulties adhering to backtoback production schedules any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely perform our existing contracts and our ability to obtain new contracts in the future moreover the concentration of our ingalls workforce in pascagoula may inhibit our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled and trained employees to perform the increased workload any failure to attract and retain the necessary workforce or to effectively manage and control thirdparty contractors could adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   

we anticipate that we will incur substantial restructuring costs and asset writedowns currently estimated at 256 million  related to the wind down of our operations at avondale we believe that substantially all such expenses will be recoverable under existing flexiblypriced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with far provisions governing the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs the dcaa prepared an initial audit report on our july 30 2010 cost recovery proposal of 310 million which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the dcaa to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately 25 million  or 8  of the costs included in the proposal we then submitted a revised proposal dated october 12 2011 to address the 

concerns of the dcaa and to reflect a revised estimated total cost of  271 million  we received a supplemental dcaa audit report which again stated that the proposal was not sufficiently supported to allow the dcaa to reach a conclusion the amount and percentage of questioned costs were materially unchanged from the previous audit report we submitted another revised proposal that addresses the dcaa concerns and supports our current restructuring cost estimate of 256 million  

although closure is still the baseline assumption for avondale we are pursuing other opportunities to utilize this facility if we are successful in pursuing such opportunities and avondale remains open we would submit a revised restructuring proposal to the us navy consistent with this change in such event we expect that our total estimated restructuring costs would decrease while the restructuring costs that are currently capitalized consisting primarily of severance and retention payments as well as retired fixed assets should remain recoverable under existing or future us navy contracts other costs would remain as part of the avondale cost structure associated with avondales new line of business 

whether we close avondale entirely or keep the facility open in a new line of business we currently do not have an agreement with the us navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down at avondale we may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down such costs which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time could be significant the actual restructuring expenses we incur in connection with our wind down of avondale including potential environmental costs may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work our assumptions on ship contracts include the length of time to complete the contract because total costs include expected increases in wages and material prices similarly our assumptions include the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts we consider incentives awards and penalties related to contract performance in estimating revenues and profit rates and we record them when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance 

the judgment and estimation processes described above are significant to our contract accounting and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant natural disasters can disrupt our facilities systems or projects which can interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts in addition should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position  in this section  

  

natural disasters can disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the us   navy and the us   coast guard 

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on a contract which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50  of our approximately 38000 employees are covered by a total of nine  collective bargaining agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in april 2014 june 2014 and july 2017 ingalls has six collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees five of which cover pascagoula and gulfport employees and one of which covers avondale employees the five pascagoulagulfport collective bargaining agreements expire in march 2015 the avondale collective bargaining agreement was indefinitely extended upon its last expiration 

collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and we must negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties with renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings equity and contributions to our pension and retiree health care plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm returns on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding of the plans 

timing differences exist between the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap pension funding requirements and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards cas board issued its final cas harmonization rule the new rule impacts pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns or other actions commonly referred to as green initiatives we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions  

  

the nature of shipbuilding operations requires the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition handling of these materials sometimes results in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways where we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

environmental laws and regulations also impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us   government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are winding down military shipbuilding at our louisiana facilities which we anticipate will be completed in 2014 our wind down of operations at these facilities may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot 

currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial instruments 

  

the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we sometimes access these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions and capital expansion projects obtaining credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program refinancing existing indebtedness and arranging for letters of credit depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

tightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to meet our contract obligations the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

our compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and extensive compliance controls policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials security clearance breaches cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we may not however prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners any improper actions could subject us to civil and criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties including suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on us navy and us coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we are providing information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy has reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million to 94 million while expressing its view that the gross amount of potential mischarging may be 51 million the us coast guard informed us that it would be premature for the coast guard to reduce its 58 million portion of the withhold based on the results of our internal investigation we estimate that the maximum amount of the mischarging is approximately 4 million we are in discussions with our us government customers regarding the potential release of an additional portion of the withheld funds but we cannot predict whether these customers will agree to a lower withhold amount depending upon the us governments assessment of the matters under investigation we could be subject to significant civil penalties criminal fines and suspension or debarment from us government contracting although we do not currently believe that this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new information might come to light in the future and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities or other disruptions could expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities and our other nuclear operations at doe sites and commercial nuclear power plants subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if a nuclear accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us   navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the situation in addition new or revised security and safety requirements   imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us   government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities that we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations to mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we acquire noncontrolling and controlling interests in businesses acquisitions and investments are made following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments in determining acquisition prices which prices must be allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates in such events we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill andor purchased intangible assets in addition declines in the trading price of our common equity can result in goodwill andor purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as of december 31 2013  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 14  and 8  respectively of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november   30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate purchased intangibles when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangibles adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our common stock price can also result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangible assets 

  

future declines in equity market multiples or the trading price of our common stock or other factors such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins at ingalls could lead to future impairments of goodwill any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability in addition the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

  

as of december 31 2013  the estimated value of our uncertain tax positions was a potential liability of 14 million  which includes accrued interest and penalties if our positions are sustained by the taxing authority in our favor the reversal of the liability would reduce our income tax provision and cost of sales and service revenues such tax positions may not however be sustained in our favor 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and have returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default by or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability 

or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures  

  

in joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture projects and internal controls relating to such projects these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture in addition in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

strategic acquisitions and investments we expect to pursue involve risks and uncertainties 

in pursuing our business strategies we review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities   in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating newlyacquired businesses challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses if we fail to manage acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions successfully our financial results business and future prospects could be harmed 

  

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position 

  

the size type and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are currently and may in the future become subject to various claims and litigation including environmental claims which if not resolved for amounts within accrued reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows claims and litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future the following paragraphs describe pending claims and litigation that if determined adversely for amounts that exceed accrued reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in a longstanding series of cases that have been and continue to be filed in various jurisdictions around the country in which former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials while on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and cannot therefore give any assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated litigation 

  

in january   2011 the us   department of justice first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us   district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint we received alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means we and northrop grumman obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million  plus penalties attorneys fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

in july 2012 the district court entered an order permitting us to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint we received including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the us department of justice to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes on december 8 2011 the department of justice filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case on february 28 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia granted the defendants motion to transfer venue and the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of mississippi we have filed a motion to dismiss the case and a motion to disqualify relator holmes and all other matters are stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss 

  

based upon a review to date of the information available to us we believe that we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts and that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit we intend to defend this matter vigorously while we believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own or have the right to use certain patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property the us government has rights to use certain intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts and it may authorize others to use such intellectual property our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other security measures these agreements may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event our intellectual property rights are infringed we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

  

we have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2013  we had 1779 million  of debt and 650 million  of additional borrowing and letter of credit capacity under our credit facility credit facility our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 25 

 

because we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our debt moreover despite our current level of debt we may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future   to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes and our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 

in addition the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limit the amount of our capital expenditures and require us to maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio among others these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit our strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes these covenants limit how we may conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs these covenants may therefore limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business 

our spinoff from northrop grumman exposes us to potential liabilities including us federal income tax liabilities 

  

our spinoff from northrop grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that northrop grumman northrop grummans stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except with respect to cash received by northrop grummans stockholders in lieu of fractional shares if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction northrop grumman would recognize a substantial gain for us   federal income tax purposes in such case under irs regulations each member of northrop grummans consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us   federal income tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff northrop grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the respective business or businesses that we own and operate following the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to northrop grumman such as certain tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if northrop grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform its allocated obligations 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our indebtedness could limit our future ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

  

our dividend policy is established by our board of directors based upon our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business 

considerations that our board of directors considers relevant the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt limit the amount of dividends we may pay and debt that we may incur in the future may limit or prohibit payments of dividends in addition the amount of our existing and any additional future debt may limit our ability to pay dividends if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends even if declared by our board of directors may be impaired there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend on our common stock 

  

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us   navy consequently the us navy has required us to include in our contracts with the navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights in the event of change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear work for the navy such provisions require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navy  s ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such provisions in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work   and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work  

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws our obligations to northrop grumman relating to the spinoff and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may also lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or a division or subdivision any suspension or debarment would likely have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on us navy and us coast guard contracts we conducted an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we are providing information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we agreed with the us navy and us coast guard that they would initially withhold 24 million in payments on existing contracts pending receipt of additional information from our internal investigation the us navy has reduced its portion of the withhold from 182 million to 94 million while expressing its view that the gross amount of potential mischarging may be 51 million the us coast guard informed us that it would be premature for the coast guard to reduce its 58 million portion of the withhold based on the results of our internal investigation we estimate that the maximum amount of the mischarging is approximately 4 million we are in discussions with our us government customers regarding the potential release of an additional portion of the withheld funds but we cannot predict whether these customers will agree to a lower withhold amount depending upon the us governments assessment of the matters under investigation we could be subject to significant civil penalties criminal fines and suspension or debarment from us government contracting although we do not currently believe that this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new 

information might come to light in the future and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter

overview 

our business 

for more than a century we have designed built overhauled and repaired ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard hii is organized into two operating segments ingalls and newport news which represent our reportable segments through our ingalls segment we are the builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters for the us coast guard and one of only two companies that builds the navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers through our newport news segment we are the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy we are one of the nations leading fullservice providers for the design engineering construction and life cycle support of major surface ship programs for the us navy we conduct substantially all of our business with the us government principally the dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the budget control act reduced the dod top line budget by 487 billion from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 additionally because congress did not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion prior to march 1 2013 budgetary sequestration was implemented under the bca sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 of 500 billion for defense spending and 500 billion for nondefense discretionary spending including the us coast guard on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act which provided 63 billion in sequestration relief over two years split evenly between defense and nondefense programs and set overall discretionary spending at 1012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and 1013 trillion for fiscal year 2015 sequestration remains in effect under the bca for fiscal years 2016 through 2021 significant uncertainty exists regarding the specific effects of sequestration in 2016 and beyond and the resulting funding reductions could have material consequences for our business employee base facilities and suppliers 

  

us government operations including appropriations for dod and department of homeland security homeland security programs were funded for the balance of fiscal year 2014 under the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 the fy 2014 act specifically provided funding for the advance construction of cvn79 john f kennedy  construction of two ssn774 virginia class submarines continuation of the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh continuation of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer production and cost to complete for lha6 america  the fy 2014 act also fully funded construction of nsc7 kimball  and provided funding for nsc8 midgett  longleadtime material the fiscal year 2015 presidents budget request is expected to be delivered to congress in march 2014 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations and peacekeeping we believe the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in february 2010 the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr emphasized four key strategic priorities prevailing in todays wars preventing and deterring conflict preparing to defeat adversaries in a wide range of contingencies and preserving and enhancing the allvolunteer force the dod is currently conducting the 2014 qdr and the results are expected to be released concurrent with submission of the fiscal year 2015 presidents budget request to the congress 

we expect that the nations engagement in a multifront multidecade struggle will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while facing additional major budget cuts that began in 2013 while the bipartisan budget act established new budget caps and provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 defense and nondefense discretionary programs the administration continues to consider how sequestration could impact programs for 2016 and beyond and the outcome of that assessment could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans 

in may 2013 the us navy released its 2014 long range plan the 2014 long range plan anticipates a fleet of 306 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines 11 nuclearpowered aircraft carriers 48 nuclearpowered attack submarines 88 large multimission surface combatants 52 small multirole surface combatants 33 amphibious landing ships 29 combat logistics force ships and 33 support vessels the 2014 long range plan also notes that the four ssgn currently in service will retire in the mid2020s and the us navy is exploring the possibility of inserting a quadpack of large diameter payload tubes in block v ssn774 virginia class submarines to offset the loss of the ssgn strike capability the 2014 long range plan also acknowledges that the dod will encounter several challenges in executing the plan particularly with regard to funding new submarines to replace the ohio class nuclear ballistic submarines significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

it is anticipated that the us navy will submit a shipbuilding plan to congress concurrent with the fiscal year 2015 presidents budget request which will provide additional details regarding the force structure of 306 ships 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys new lcs the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod announced various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors the most recent initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy these initiatives are relatively new and the specific impacts on our industry will be understood better as the dod implements them further see risks related to our business in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our revenues from longterm government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us 

that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these areas it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  we derive the majority of our revenues from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2013  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and risk retirement on the legend class nsc program for the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to the closing of our gulfport facility costs and delays on 

lha6 america associated with the remediation of mechanical issues identified during testing as well as unfavorable performance on lpd25 somerset including costs and delays associated with repairing damages caused by underwater debris during preparation for sea trials 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily the result of risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise  edsra as well as the receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party for the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to higher than expected costs to complete lpd24 uss arlington as well as increased workers compensation expense driven by discount rates 

for the year ended   december 31 2011  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily the result of risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and lpd23 anchorage  unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in 2011 were primarily related to lower performance on lpd22 uss san diego  and lpd24 uss arlington  

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

other considerations  defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan retirement related benefit plans benefit costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon cas the cas requirements for retirement related benefit plans costs differ from the financial accounting standards fas requirements given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the cas and fas requirements to determine specific recoverability we have not estimated the incremental fas income or expense recoverable under our expected future contract activity and therefore did not defer any fas expense for retirement related benefit plans therefore the difference between fas and cas is recorded as period income or expense within general administrative expenses this resulted in a fas expense in excess of cas cost of 61 million  80 million  and 23 million  for the years ended   december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill at both december 31 2013  and 2012  was 881 million  

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including 

judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2013 impairment test  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2013 and determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of both december 31 2013  and 2012  were 25 million  and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of military shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2013  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal 

proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense see note 13 income taxes in item 8 changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related plans 

we recognize on a planbyplan basis the funded status of our retirement related plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to aftertax accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets or liabilities the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets see note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the determination allocation and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

the cash funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below different funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code among various items we consider both the minimum funding requirements and the funded status of each plan from the perspective of potential benefit restrictions in developing our contribution schedule in a given year and we may make additional discretionary contributions beyond minimum funding requirements 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted map21 includes provisions for potential relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that are used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions will be phased out to lower levels over the next few years we consider the effects of legislation such as map21 in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding on the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

we record cas retirement related benefits cost in the results of our business segments and we include the fas expense for these benefits in total operating income under gaap due to the differences between fas and cas amounts we also present the difference between fas expense and cas cost referred to as our fascas adjustment to reconcile segment operating income to total operating income on a consolidated basis under gaap due to the foregoing differences in requirements and calculation methodologies our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow misalignment on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule harmonization harmonization is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under harmonization only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after 

the effective date of february 27 2012 reflect the effects of the rule harmonization affects pension costs on contracts with initial effects beginning in 2013 we expect it will result in increased recoverable cas pension costs allocable to our contracts with greater impacts beginning to phase in during 2014 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans   benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date consequently the discount rate can be volatile from year to year the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 100 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or indexlinked since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 527  and 424  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 503  and 404  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns in order to reflect expected lower future market returns we reduced the expected longterm rate of return assumption from 800 used to record 2012 expense to 750 for 2013 the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption was primarily related to lower asset class returns for long bonds and to a lesser extent for equities unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year we will continue to use this 750 assumption for recording 2014 fas pension expense we assess this assumption at least annually 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants which is approximately 10 years in 2013  the actual return on assets was approximately 105 which was higher than the expected return assumption of 750 for the year ended december 31 2013  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 103 and 99 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in a combined net actuarial gain of approximately 949 million 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



a 50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately 2 million depending on the timing of the contribution 

cas cost  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption a plan’s cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements 

through 2013 cas required the discount rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changed infrequently given its longterm nature as a result shortterm changes in bond or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality bonds when harmonization is fully phased in the greater of the two liabilities will be used for cas cost calculations generally liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization the four year phase in period commencing in 2014 requires the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities we expect our allocable cas costs to increase under harmonization as the regulation was intended  

other fas and cas considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the employees average future service life of approximately 10 years under cas net gains and losses were amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under harmonization the amortization period for cas changed to 10 years for gains and losses experienced beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically spread over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this spreading method and instead use fair value in determining our fas expenses accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent gains and losses faster than cas 

additionally cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas cost will change accordingly we update our estimates of future fas expense and cas cost at least annually based on factors such as actual calendar year plan asset returns actual census data and other actual and projected experience 

the fascas adjustment in 2013  was a net expense of 61 million  compared to a net expense of 80 million  in 2012  the favorable  change was driven by increased cas cost partially offset by increased fas expense the increase in fas expense was due primarily to commencing the amortization in 2013 of the net actuarial losses incurred in 2012 partially offset by the impact of the remeasurement in 2013 of our postretirement benefit plans   the fascas adjustment in 2012  was a net expense of 80 million  compared to a net expense of 23 million  in 2011  the unfavorable  change was driven by an increase in our fas expense due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate assumption our projection of the 2014 fascas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results  operating income 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds and real estate investments are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav for the very limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value 

accumulated other comprehensive income  we record in accumulated other comprehensive income unrecognized gains and losses as well as unrecognized prior service costs and credits arising from our retirement related plans as disclosed in note 18 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized losses as of december 31 2013  and 2012  were 897 million  and 1980 million  respectively these net deferred losses primarily originated from changes in the discount rate differences between estimated and expected asset returns and changes in demographic experience the decrease in these deferred losses in 2013  was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rates for 833 million 2013  actual asset returns being 116 million greater than expected and 134 million of amortization of previously recognized losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs credits as of december 31 2013  and 2012  were 28 million  and 48 million  respectively these net deferred costs credits primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs credits in 2013  primarily resulted from a favorable other postretirement benefits plan amendment of 145 million partially offset by an unfavorable pension plan amendment of 66 million and 3 million of amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs credits 

the amortization period for qualifying unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized gainslosses is the estimated remaining service lives of our employees which is approximately 10 years 

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans in addition to participating in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded 34 million in workers compensation expense due to a lower discount rate of 159 our workers compensation liability was discounted at 216  and 159  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate we estimate a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers compensation liability by 50 million and 61 million respectively the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 792 million  and 719 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the following table 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced therefore sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance under far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consist of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

2013   product sales in 2013   increased   46 million  or 1  from 2012  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 80 million in 2013  primarily due to lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants newport news product sales increased 126 million in 2013  as a result of higher volumes in aircraft carriers and submarines 

service revenues in 2013   increased   66 million  or 7  from 2012  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 7 million in 2013  as lower volumes in surface combatants services were partially offset by higher 

volumes in fleet support services service revenues at our newport news segment increased 73 million in 2013  primarily due to higher volumes in fleet support and aircraft carrier related services 

2012   product sales in 2012   increased   79 million  or 1  from 2011  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased by 10 million in 2012  as a result of lower sales volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher sales volumes in surface combatants and the legend class nsc program newport news product sales increased by 89 million in 2012  due to higher sales volumes in aircraft carrier programs partially offset by lower sales volumes in submarine programs 

service revenues in 2012   increased   54 million  or 6  from 2011  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased by 31 million in 2012  primarily as a result of lower volumes in surface combatant support services service revenues at our newport news segment increased by 85 million in 2012  due to the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise extended drydocking selected restricted availability edsra and higher volumes in energy services aircraft carrier and submarine related engineering services and fleet support services 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2013   cost of product sales in 2013   decreased   132 million  or 3  as compared to 2012  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 174 million in 2013  primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries and lower volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher volumes in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 42 million in 2013  primarily due to higher volumes in aircraft carriers partially offset by lower costs on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by performance improvement and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined  from 839  in 2012  to 809  in 2013  primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes as well as risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 

2012   cost of product sales in 2012   increased   33 million  or 1  as compared to 2011  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 26 million in 2012  primarily as a result of the lower sales volumes described above improved performance on the lpd17 san antonio class program as well as receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party partially offset by increased workers compensation expense cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 59 million in 2012  primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above and increased workers compensation expense cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined from 845  in 2011  to 839  in 2012  primarily due to improved overall performance at our ingalls segment 

cost of service revenues   

2013   cost of service revenues in 2013   increased   86 million  or 11  as compared to 2012  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 5 million in 2013  as a result of the lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 91 million in 2013  primarily as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased  from 842  in 2012  to 871  in 2013  primarily due to the favorable resolution in 2012 of outstanding contract changes as well as normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2012    cost of service revenues in 2012   increased   25 million  or 3  as compared to 2011  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 24 million in 2012  as a result of the lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 49 million in 2012  as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined from 864  in 2011  to 842  in 2012  primarily due to the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra as well as normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2013   income from operating investments net decreased   4 million  or 22  to 14 million  in 2013  from 18 million  in 2012  the decrease was a result of reduced work funded by the american reinvestment and recovery act at our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2012    income from operating investments net decreased  by 2 million  or 10  to 18 million  in 2012  from 20 million  in 2011  the decrease was primarily driven by reduced work in 2012 funded by the american reinvestment and recovery act at our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordan ce with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2013   general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2013  compared to 2012  this was primarily the result of favorable variances in deferred state tax expense and the fascas adjustment offsetting increases in current state tax expense legal expenses and bid and proposal efforts 

2012    general and administrative expenses in 2012   increased   105 million  or 17  from 2011  this increase  was primarily the result of increases in the fascas adjustment and deferred state income tax expenses 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2013   we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2013  

2012    we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2012  we recorded a net goodwill impairment charge in 2011 of 290 million in our ingalls segment see note 11 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income segment operating income is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe investors consider segment operating income to be a useful measure of the performance of our operating segments 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



segment operating income 

2013   segment operating income in 2013  was 567 million  as compared to 457 million  in 2012  the increase  was primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes as well as risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 partially offset by the impact of closing our gulfport facility and the favorable resolution in 2012 of outstanding contract changes 

2012   segment operating income in 2012  was 457 million  as compared to 122 million  in 2011  the increase  was primarily the result of the absence in 2012 of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2011 improved overall performance at our ingalls segment and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by increased workers compensation expense 

activity within each segment is discussed in segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2013   the fascas adjustment in 2013  was a net expense of 61 million  compared to a net expense of 80 million  in 2012  the favorable  change was driven by increased cas cost partially offset by increased fas expense the increase in fas expense was due primarily to commencing the amortization in 2013 of the net actuarial losses incurred in 2012 partially offset by the impact of the remeasurement in 2013 of our postretirement benefit plans 

2012   the fascas adjustment in 2012  was a net expense of 80 million  compared to a net expense of 23 million  in 2011  the unfavorable  change was driven by an increase in our fas expense due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate assumption 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2014  to be a net benefit of approximately 92 million driven by higher fas discount rates the effect of second quarter 2013 amendments to our postretirement health care plans and the initial 25 phase in of harmonization the expected fascas adjustment is subject to update during 2014  when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with final 2013  asset returns and census data and possibly for any potential amendments to our plans that might be subject to remeasurement during 2014  

deferred state income taxes 

deferred state income taxes reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income while the current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2013   the deferred state income taxes benefit  in 2013  was 6 million  compared to an expense  of 19 million  in 2012  this change was primarily attributable to the recognition of previously deferred tax losses on contracts which increased 2012 deferred state tax expense deferred state taxes in 2013 were favorably impacted by pension related changes and increases in reserves 

2012   the deferred state income taxes expense  in 2012  was 19 million  compared to a benefit  of 1 million  in 2011  the increase was primarily due to the timing of contract related income spinoff related adjustments and pension related deductions 

interest expense 

2013   interest expense remained relatively constant in 2013  at 118 million  compared to 117 million  in 2012  

2012   interest expense in 2012  was 117 million  compared to 104 million  in 2011  the increase  was primarily due to a full year of interest in 2012 on our senior notes and indebtedness under the credit facility partially offset by the elimination of intercompany indebtedness to northrop grumman in connection with the spinoff 

federal income taxes   

2013    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 338  in 2013  compared to 394  in 2012  the 2012 tax rate included the impact of an 8 million unfavorable noncash tax adjustment arising under the tax matters agreement with northrop grumman which requires indemnification between us and northrop grumman for aggregate tax adjustments exceeding a certain threshold for periods prior to the spinoff see note 13 income taxes in item 8 excluding this adjustment the effective tax rate for 2012 was 361 the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and enactment of the american taxpayer relief act in january 2013 which retroactively extended the research and development tax credit through the end of 2013 our effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the entire 2012 income tax benefit for the research and development tax credit which expired at the end of 2011 

2012   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 394  in 2012  compared to 336  in 2011  excluding the 2011 noncash goodwill impairment charge of 290 million which is nondeductible for income tax purposes the increase in our effective tax rate for 2012  compared to 2011  was primarily the result of 8 million in noncash tax adjustments arising under our tax matters agreement with northrop grumman which requires indemnification between us and northrop grumman for aggregate tax adjustments exceeding a certain threshold for periods prior to the spinoff see note 13 income taxes in item 8 our effective tax rate can also differ from the federal statutory rate as a result of nondeductible expenditures the research and development tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction our effective tax rate for 2012  does not reflect the income tax benefit for the research and development  tax credit which expired at the end of 2011  the american taxpayer relief act which was signed into law on january 2 2013 retroactively extends the research and development tax credit  through the end of 2013 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into two reportable segments ingalls and newport news 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls 



sales and service revenues   

2013   ingalls revenues including intersegment sales decreased   83 million  or 3  in   2013  compared to 2012  driven by lower revenues in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher revenues in the legend class nsc program and surface combatants the decrease in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to lower volumes on lpd24 uss arlington lpd23 uss anchorage lha6 america and   lpd25 somerset  partially offset by higher volumes on lpd27 portland  and lha7 tripoli revenues on the legend class nsc program increased primarily due to higher volumes on the construction contracts of nsc6 munro and nsc5 james surface combatants revenues increased due to higher volumes on ddg117 paul ignatius and ddg113 john finn  partially offset by lower volumes on the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer program 

2012   ingalls revenues including intersegment sales decreased   45 million  or 2  in 2012  compared to 2011  as a result of lower sales volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher sales volumes in the legend class nsc program the decrease in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to lower sales following the deliveries of lpd23 uss anchorage  and lpd24 uss arlington  in 2012 and following the delivery of lpd22 uss san diego in 2011 partially offset by higher sales volume on lha7 tripoli  lpd27 portland  lpd26 john p murtha  and lpd25 somerset  the increase in revenues on the legend class nsc program was the result of higher sales volume on the construction of nsc4 hamilton  and nsc5 james  and the advance procurement contract on nsc6 munro  partially offset by lower sales resulting from the delivery of nsc3 uscgc stratton in 2011 surface combatants revenues remained stable as higher sales on the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer construction program driven by higher sales on ddg114 ralph johnson  partially offset by lower sales on d dg110 uss william p lawrence delivered in 2011 as well as higher sales on the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer program were offset by lower revenues in surface combatants support services 

segment operating income 

2013   ingalls operating income  in 2013  was 175 million  compared to income  of 97 million  in 2012  the increase  was primarily due to the impact of hurricane insurance recoveries risk retirement and higher volumes on the legend class nsc program as well as the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 partially offset by the impact of closing our gulfport facility 

2012   ingalls operating income  in 2012  was 97 million  compared to a loss  of 220 million  in 2011  the increase was pri marily due to the absence in 2012 of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2011 improved overall performance and the receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party partially offset by increased workers compensation expense 

newport news 



sales and service revenues 

2013   newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased   199 million  or 5  in   2013  compared to 2012  primarily driven by higher revenues in aircraft carriers fleet support services and submarines higher revenues in aircraft carriers were primarily due to increased volumes on the execution contract for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh the construction preparation contract for cvn79 john f kennedy and the inactivation contract for cvn65 uss enterprise  partially offset by lower volumes on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh and the construction and engineering contracts for cvn78 gerald r ford higher revenues in fleet support services were primarily the result of volumes associated with repair work on ssn765 uss montpelier  increased submarines revenues were related to the ssn774 virginia class submarine program primarily driven by higher volumes on block iii boats and the advance procurement contract on block iv boats partially offset by lower volumes on block ii boats following the delivery of ssn783 uss minnesota  

2012   newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased   174 million  or 5  in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily driven by higher sales volumes in aircraft carrier programs energy and fleet support services partially offset by lower sales volumes in submarine programs the increase in aircraft carriers was primarily due to higher revenues on the construction contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  the advance construction contract for cvn79 john f kennedy  the advance planning contract for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by lower revenues on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh and an engineering contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  energy services revenues were higher due to maintenance services at the kesselring site fleet support revenues increased due primarily to increased maintenance work on inservice aircraft carriers the decrease in submarine program revenues was the result of lower sales volumes on the ssn774 virginia class submarine construction program due to the timing of procurement of production materials 

segment operating income 

2013   newport news operating income  in 2013  was 392 million  compared to income  of 360 million  in 2012  the increase  was primarily related to the ssn774 virginia class submarine program driven by risk retirement performance improvement and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes as well as risk retirement on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss  theodore roosevelt rcoh and the absence in 2013 of the workers compensation expense adjustment recorded in 2012 partially offset by the favorable resolution in 2012 of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise  edsra 

  

2012   newport news operating income  in 2012  was 360 million  compared to income  of 342 million  in 2011  the increase  was due primarily to the increased sales volumes described above favorable performance on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by higher workers compensation expense 

backlog 

total backlog as of december 31 2013  was approximately 18 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of december 31 2013  and 2012  



we expect approximately 32  of the 18 billion  total backlog as of december 31 2013  to be converted into sales in 2014  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2013  and 2012  

awards 

2013   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2013  was approximately 94 billion significant new awards in 2013  included contracts for the construction of five ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh inactivation of cvn65 uss enterprise construction of nsc6 munro  and continued construction preparation for cvn79 john f kennedy  

2012   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2012  was approximately 60 billion significant new awards in 2012  included contracts for the detail design and construction of lha7 tripoli  detail design and construction of lpd27 portland  planning efforts for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh and continued longlead time procurement and construction preparation for cvn79 john f kennedy  

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  as classified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2013   cash provided by  operating activities was 236 million  in 2013  compared to 332 million  in 2012  the decrease  of 96 million  was due primarily to increases in income tax payments and retirement benefit funding within trade working capital higher inventoried costs and accounts receivable were offset by higher income taxes payable and accounts payable and accruals in 2013  we paid net cash of 154 million  for federal and state income taxes 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2014  in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents as well as existing credit facilities to be more than sufficient to service debt meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

2012   cash provided by  operating activities was 332 million  in 2012  compared to 528 million  in 2011  the decrease  of 196 million  was due primarily to increases in retirement benefit funding and trade working capital offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes the change in trade working capital was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventoried costs in 2012  we paid net cash of 28 million  for federal and state income taxes 

investing activities 

2013   cash used in  investing activities was 81 million  in 2013  a decrease  of 81 million  from 2012  this decrease was driven by proceeds from hurricane insurance recoveries and lower capital expenditures in 2013 we expect our capital expenditures in 2014  to be approximately 3 of annual revenues 

2012   cash used in  investing activities was 162 million  in 2012  consisting entirely of capital expenditures a decrease  of 35 million  from 2011  this decrease resulted primarily from a onetime reimbursement to the state of louisiana in 2011 related to the avondale wind down 

financing activities 

2013   cash used in  financing activities in 2013  was 169 million  compared to 28 million   used in   2012  the increase was primarily due  to an additional 118 million of repurchases of common stock 22 million of debt repayments and 20 million of cash dividend payments partially offset by 24 million of excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation  in 2013  compared to 2012  

2012   cash used in  financing activities in 2012  was 28 million  which resulted from 29 million  of debt repayments and 6 million of stockholder distributions offset by 7 million  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was 584 million our cash flow from financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of 1775 million of debt of which 22 million was repaid in 2011 a 1266 million net transfer from our former parent and 2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by 54 million of debt issuance costs repayment of 954 million of notes to our former parent and a contribution of 1429 million to northrop grumman as a result of the spinoff 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures we believe investors consider free cash flow to be a useful measure of our performance because it indicates the total cash available for redeployment we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



2013   free cash flow decreased 73 million  from 2012 due primarily to increases in income tax payments and retirement benefit funding partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2013 

2012   free cash flow decreased 161 million  from 2011 due primarily to increases in retirement benefit funding and trade working capital offset by decreases in deferred income taxes and capital expenditures 

retirement related plan contributions 

erisa including amendments under the ppa and map21 defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts we consider various factors including attainment of the funded percentage needed to avoid benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences minimum cas funding requirements and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors including published irs interest rates the actual return on plan assets actuarial assumptions and demographic experience these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans funded status we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  



we made minimum and discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 301 million  and 236 million  in the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we were not required to make minimum contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2011 and made no discretionary contributions 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  our qualified pension plans were funded 93 and 76 respectively on a fas basis as of december 31 2013  and 2012  these plans were considered at least 90 funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to develop respective obligations for these two different purposes we expect our 2014  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be 123 million  all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts due to the differences in calculation methodologies our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 38 million  31 million  and 33 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we expect our 2014  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 35 million  which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts contributions for postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an asincurred basis 

other sources and uses of capital

our primary areas of business include the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants expeditionary warfareamphibious assault and coastal defense surface ships as well as the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of nuclearpowered ships we operate our shipbuilding business through our huntington ingalls incorporated subsidiary which is organized into two segments ingalls shipbuilding ingalls which includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses and newport news shipbuilding newport news which includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses 

  

our three major shipyards are currently located in pascagoula mississippi avondale louisiana and newport news virginia we intend to wind down military shipbuilding at our avondale shipyard in 2013 and consolidate those activities into our pascagoula shipyard we are exploring the potential for alternative uses of the avondale facility including alternative opportunities for the workforce there for a more detailed discussion of the costs that we expect to incur in connection with the wind down of military shipbuilding at avondale see risk factors in item 1a 

we conduct substantially all of our business with the us government principally the department of defense dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs with our product capabilities heavy industrial facilities and a workforce of approximately 37000  employees we believe we are positioned to continue to support the longterm objectives of the us navy and us coast guard to adapt and respond to a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment 

we became an independent publiclyowned company on march 31 2011 when we were spun off from northrop grumman corporation northrop grumman following the spinoff from northrop grumman we have owned and operated the legacy northrop grumman shipbuilding business

through our ingalls operations we design and construct nonnuclear ships for the us navy and us coast guard including amphibious assault ships surface combatants and national security cutters we are the sole supplier of amphibious assault ships to the us navy and built 28 of the 62ship ddg51 arleigh burke class of aegis guided missile destroyers in active service we are also the sole builder of the large multimission national security cutters for the us coast guard our ingalls shipbuilding sites are located in pascagoula mississippi gulfport mississippi and avondale louisiana these facilities offer a collection of manufacturing capabilities such as a 660ton gantry crane a shipbuilding facility focused on composite engineering and production and a land based test facility 

we are winding down military shipbuilding at avondale but we are currently exploring alternative uses for the avondale facility we believe that consolidating ingalls military shipbuilding at our pascagoula facility will decrease our fixed overhead expenses provide improved facility utilization and a more costefficient construction process centralize our shipbuilding learning and increase the benefits of serial production and reduce program costs thereby enhancing our competitive positions 

amphibious assault ships 

  

we are the sole supplier to the us navy of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships which include the us navy large deck amphibious ships lha amphibious transport dock ships lpd and multipurpose amphibious assault ships lhd the lha is a key component of the us navymarine corps requirement for 11 expeditionary strike groupsamphibious readiness groups and design construction and modernization of lhas are core to our ingalls operations in 2009 construction of lhd1 wasp class multipurpose amphibious assault ships concluded with the delivery of lhd8 uss makin island  in 2007 we were awarded the construction contract for lha6 america  the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized marine assault platform the first ship of the lha6 america class is currently under construction and we expect to deliver it in 2013 we were awarded the construction contract for lha7 tripoli  in 2012

newport news 

the capabilities of our newport news operations extend from our core nuclear business of designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships to our secondary businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operations management and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through department of energy doe programs our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states our facilities are located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities that include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock and a 1050ton gantry crane capable of servicing two aircraft carriers at one time 

  

design construction and refueling and complex overhaul of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to our operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navys fleet with a displacement of over 90000 tons since 1933 newport news has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the us navy including all ten ships currently in active service 

  

the us navys newest carrier and the last of the cvn68 nimitz class cvn77 uss george hw bush  was delivered in 2009 we have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier the cvn78 gerald r ford class for over ten years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class cvn78 gerald r ford  which is scheduled for delivery in 2015 we subsequently received awards in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 totaling 15 billion under a construction preparation contract for the second cvn78 gerald r ford class aircraft carrier cvn79 john f kennedy  this contract includes design planning procurement of longleadtime materials and limited fabrication as well as continued research and development with key suppliers 

  

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul rcoh each rcoh takes over three years to complete and the work accounts for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carriers service life rcoh services include propulsion work refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers and rudders launch and recovery system piping repairs and component refurbishment and modernization electrical systems aviation support systems warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and onsite fleet repair work 

we are currently performing a rcoh on cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  and expect to redeliver it to the us navy following its completion in 2013 beginning in 2010 we received awards totaling 703 million under a planning contract for the rcoh of cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  we believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers as well as the fact that rcoh work requires a highly trained workforce is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly positions us for the award of future rcoh contracts on the current and future fleet of us navy aircraft carriers 

  

aircraft carrier inactivation 

  

aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the ten carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as those we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation we expect to be awarded a contract with the us navy in 2013 to inactivate the cvn65 uss enterprise  the worlds first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 beginning in 2008 we received awards totaling 318 million under an advance planning contract to begin preparations for the execution of the inactivation we have constructed the facility to perform aircraft carrier inactivation work at our newport news shipyard we believe that the us navy will require inactivation of other aircraft carriers in the naval fleet as they reach the end of their lifespans and we intend to be positioned as the best choice to be awarded that work 

  

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

  

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy since 1960 newport news has delivered 57  submarines to the us navy comprised of 43  fast attack and 14  ballistic missile submarines of the 54 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 25 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning 

in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat a division of general dynamics corporation general dynamics to build ssn774 virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room control room and pressure hull structure work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarines alternate between electric boat and us 

the four submarines of the first block and the first five submarines of the second block of ssn774 virginia class submarines have been delivered construction on the final submarine of the second block is underway with delivery scheduled for 2013 in december 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight ssn774 virginia class submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year from 2011 to 2013 the eighth submarine to be procured under this contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019

the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2013 states the us navys intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging ohio class nuclear ballistic and cruise missile submarines the us navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the ssbn ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ssbn which were first introduced into service in 1981 we are currently participating in the design effort and our experience and wellqualified workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort the ssbn ohio class includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ssgn the ohio  replacement program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15year period at a cost of approximately 4 billion to 7 billion each the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to electric boat congress has delayed the start of the first ohio  replacement submarine by two years and construction is now expected to begin in 2021 with procurement of longleadtime materials in 2017 and delivery in 2030 the first ohio class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2027 with an additional submarine being retired each year thereafter by 2030 the ohio class ballistic missile submarine fleet is expected to be down to ten the current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may cause additional delay to the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured but we believe the ohio  replacement program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 6 segment information in item 8 

customers 

revenues from the us government accounted for substantially all of our revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 in 2012 2011 and 2010 appr oximately 96 97 and 97 respectively of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 4 3 and 3 r espectively were generated from the us coast guard 

intellectual property 

with approximately 5000 engineers and designers we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our us government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense the us government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government while our intellectual property rights are important to our operations we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

  

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments  revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

as of december 31 2012  and 2011  our total backlog was approximately 16 billion  approximately 31  of backlog at december 31 2012  is expected to be converted into sales in 2013  

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

  

the most significant raw material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source however due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our future needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with certain raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers 

research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development ird efforts related to government programs we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts consistent with us government regulations we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 21 million  24 million  and 23 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

  

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center vascic located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it has a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic benefits the us navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risks related to our business in item 1a 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the us navys supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by our customer or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties as well as administrative sanctions which may 

include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension and prohibition from doing business with the us government 

the us government has the ability pursuant to recent regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems for our contracts subject to these new regulations the us government has in certain instances withheld payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns 

  

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions that provide for reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not for the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in 2009 congress passed legislation to improve the organization and procedures of the dod for the acquisition of major weapons systems including shipbuilding and maritime systems this legislation the weapon system acquisition reform act of 2009 requires the dod to develop mechanisms to address cost schedule and performance in establishing program requirements as acquisition reform progresses we will continue to anticipate the actions of the pentagon and congress to determine their impact on our operations and respond appropriately 

  

government contractors must comply with a significant volume of procurement regulations and other requirements contracting with the us government may result in our filing of requests for equitable adjustments reas which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible reas are prepared submitted and negotiated in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and rcoh activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations are unproductive 

  

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs and therefore are not recoverable the us government also regulates the methods by which all costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

  

our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to additional procurement regulations that include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act a noncompliance determination by any one agency may result in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 

competition 

we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent smaller shipyards one or more of which may team with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in the market because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and defueling the us navys nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities in this regard the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 2012 act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 2013 act modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law 

we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are also the sole supplier of nscs for the us coast guard and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and one of only two companies that builds the us navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers we are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navys budget as well as our ability to provide the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party prp by the us   environmental protection agency epa or similarly designated by another environmental agency our estimated costs can change given the inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs caused by uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating on a sitebysite basis the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur taking into account currently available information at each site the current state of technology and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts technology and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in current operating facilities we record environmental accruals at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we estimate that as of december 31 2012  our probable future costs for environmental remediation is approximately 2 million  which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of military shipbuilding at avondale these costs are not reasonably estimable at this time however due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur accordingly potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of avondale are not included in our 2 million  accrual for environmental remediation or our 256 million  estimate of avondale asset writedowns and restructuring costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements we expect that a significant portion of any future environmental costs we incur at avondale would be recoverable consistent with government accounting practices under the federal acquisition regulations far 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations including any enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives we have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws we expect however to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time however we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics we have experience d five industr ial related fatalities in the past seven years we strive to keep our occupational safety  health administration osha compliance programs strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from oshas voluntary protection program osha vpp to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work since then our gulfport mississippi and continental maritime of san diego facilities have also been certified as osha vpp star sites 

  

the us navy nuclear regulatory commission and doe regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators 

employees 

we have approximately 37000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration shipbuilding employees we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades approximately 5000 engineers and designers and approximately 1600 employees with advanced degrees employees who have been with us or our predecessor companies for over 40 years achieve the title of master shipbuilder as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 1100 master shipbuilders approximately 900 at newport news and approximately 200 at ingalls we employ more than 5500 veterans 

our newport news apprentice school trains approximately 800 apprentices each year in 19 crafts and trades and several advanced programs our ingalls apprentice school currently has approximately 300 registered apprentices in its programs apprentices are paid as fulltime employees for the duration of their studies and usually continue to work with us upon graduation from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 2900 alumni of the apprentice school at newport news and approximately 1900 alumni of our ingalls apprentice school continue to work with us 

approximately 50  of our approximately 37000   employees are covered by a total of nine  collective bargaining agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in march 2013 april 2014 and june 2014 ingalls has six collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees five of which cover pascagoula and gulfport employees and one of which covers avondale employees the five pascagoulagulfport collective bargaining agreements expire in march 2015 and the avondale collective bargaining agreement was indefinitely extended upon its last expiration we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

risks related to our business 

  

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customers ability to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business is primarily dependent upon the design construction repair maintenance fleet support and life cycle services of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the refueling and overhaul of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues in 2012  were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future in addition substantially all of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2012  we are a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us   government and its agencies the related contracts are subject to various risks including our customers political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work delays in the timing of contract approval and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

contracts with the us government are subject to uncertain levels of funding modification due to changes in customer priorities and potential termination 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the us   navy and the us coast guard the funding of us   government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and may receive additional funding only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated we cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process in continuing resolutions or in individual supplemental appropriations 

the impact of congressional actions to reduce the debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers the level of future appropriations for defense programs became more uncertain following congress consideration of the debt ceiling in august 2011 and the failure of a joint committee of congress to identify up to 12 trillion in deficit reductions in november 2011 as required under the budget control act of 2011 budget control act as a result of such failure up to 500 billion in automatic spending cuts to defense programs from 2013 to 2021 representing approximately 9 of planned defense spending plus an additional 500 billion to nondefense discretionary programs over this period including the us coast guard could be triggered under the budget control act beginning in 2013 or cuts could be effected through other congressional actions this sequestration could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs the budget control act cut a total of 487 billion from defense spending over the next decade representing approximately 8 of planned defense spending and the 500 billion of sequestration cuts in defense programs would be added to that amount 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 american taxpayer relief act enacted on january 2 2013 delayed the implementation of sequestration to march 1 2013 the delay in sequestration leaves the dod less time to enact the 2013 automatic spending cuts adding to the uncertainty from such cuts the federal debt ceiling is also 

expected to be reached in the first half of 2013 congress and the administration continue to debate these issues and the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans 

us government operations including defense programs for fiscal year 2013 are being funded under a continuing resolution cr which expires on march 27 2013 the cr generally provides funding at fiscal year 2012 levels and effectively eliminates new contract starts which impacts some of the programs in which we participate for example the us navy has announced that commencement of the rcoh for cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  which had been scheduled for february 2013 will be postponed due to funding uncertainty resulting from the absence of a defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2013 it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed for fiscal year 2013 the us government may operate under a cr for all of fiscal year 2013 potentially resulting in no new contract or program starts for the fiscal year any significant delays in contract starts affecting our programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that the delayed sequestration cuts other defense spending cuts or lack of a current year defense appropriations bill will have on funding for our individual programs longterm funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced delayed or cancelled in addition defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding which would adversely affect our future sales under such programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in customer priorities due to military transformation and planning or the nature of war related activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the us   government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us   governments convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs already incurred on the contracts and profit related to those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforcerelated issues or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timeliness and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and product quality performance delays availability and timing of funding from the customer and natural disasters the process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our ability to recover   the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customer depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us   government business is currently performed under firm fixed price ffp fixed price incentive fpi cost plus incentive fee cpif cost plus fixed fee cpff and cost plus award fee cpaf contracts under ffp contracts we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced agreements under which overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us   government and us the us   government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price 

typically 125135 of target cost our profit on fpi contracts varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the us   government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract 

of ingalls   revenues in 2012  approximately 78  were generated from fpi contracts approximately 11  were generated from cpaf contracts approximately 9  were generated from cpff contracts and approximately 2  were generated from ffp contracts of newport news 2012  revenues approximately 42  were generated from cpif contracts which primarily included aircraft carrier construction and rcoh approximately 32  were generated from cpff contracts approximately 24  were generated from fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction approximately 1  were generated from cpaf contracts and approximately 1  were generated from ffp contracts to the extent our mix of contract types change in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected 

  

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under contracts 

  

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if actual events differ significantly from one or more of our assumptions projections or estimates or if we incur unanticipated contract costs the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing 

  

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers we are subject to potential delivery disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

  

our costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us   government contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty in addition significant delay in deliveries of key raw materials which may occur as a result of availability or price could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain raw materials components and parts from supply sources approved by the us   government due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry there are currently certain components for which only one supplier exists the inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component in a timely or costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our results of operations depend on awards of new contracts 

  

the prospects of us   shipyards including ours are materially affected by their success in securing significant us   navy contract awards in february 2006 the us navy presented to congress a goal of achieving and maintaining a fleet of 313 ships each year the us navy presents to congress the navys annual report to congress on longrange plan for construction of naval vessels the shipbuilding plan which includes the navys shipbuilding plan for the next five years and a longrange projection of new ship construction for the following 25 years the us navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2013 the 2013 shipbuilding plan included a 

fleet goal of 310 to 316 ships down from the fleet goal of 328 ships included in the navys shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2012 the 2012 shipbuilding plan and the procurement of 268 ships over the next 30 years down from the 275ship procurement included in the 2012 shipbuilding plan the dod released in january 2012 the defense strategic guidance a new set of strategic military priorities and guidance the us navy recently released its 2013 navy combatant vessel force structure assessment the 2013 force structure assessment a comprehensive description of the navys current ship requirements in light of the defense strategic guidance the 2013 force structure assessment includes a fleet of 306 ships as a baseline significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we believe our shipbuilding programs are a high priority for national defense but under budgetary pressures one or more of our programs may be reduced extended or terminated by our us   government customers specific actions already taken that could negatively affect us include the deferral of production of new amphibious ships the reduction in the number of planned large surface combatants an increase in the procurement interval for aircraft carriers beyond five years and postponement of the commencement of the rcoh for cvn72 uss  abraham lincoln   in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of smart weapons future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in a decreased need for our shipbuilding programs including our aircraft carrier programs for the year ended december 31 2012  our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 40  of our consolidated revenue significant reductions in congressional appropriations for our shipbuilding programs or significant delays in such appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the department of defense has announced plans for significant changes to its business practices that could have a material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

  

in november 2010 the dod announced certain initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors these initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy our understanding is that these initiatives are intended to reduce costs and enhance efficiencies and productivity as described by a senior dod official they are intended to enable the dod to do more without more in november 2012 the dod further expanded its focus on business process improvement by introducing better buying power 20 bbp 20 to enhance its focus on the acquisition workforce by establishing higher standards and stronger professional qualification requirements for key leadership positions and continuing to increase the cost consciousness of the acquisition workforce bbp 20 also includes new initiatives focused on enforcing affordability caps controlling costs through cost performance measures encouraging stronger partnerships with the requirements community and incentivizing industry by aligning profitability more tightly with dod goals and employing appropriate contract types 

dods focus on business practices is expected to impact the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod we are taking steps internally to assess how we can respond to and support these changes including how we can further reduce costs and increase productivity modify how we respond to proposals and revise our areas of focus depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to develop and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

  

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must develop and sustain the workforce technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of engineers and skilled workers at competitive costs and with requisite skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce development and 

maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts or attracting new business 

  

competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

  

we believe the programs and number of ship constructions refuelings and overhauls and inactivations currently planned by the us   navy over the next several years will remain relatively steady however us   defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict while the us navys 2013 shipbuilding plan anticipates a fleet size of 310 to 316 ships the plan does not include enough ships to fully support all elements of the navys 310 to 316 ships goal over the 30year period the us navy currently projects that shortfalls would occur at various points during this 30year period in ballistic missile submarines cruisersdestroyers attack submarines and amphibious ships the us navy recently released the 2013 force structure assessment to address the navys current ship requirements in light of the defense strategic guidance released by the dod in 2012 the 2013 force structure assessment includes a fleet of 306 ships as a baseline  reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition we compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and we may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build our products if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe that two existing us governmentowned shipyards one in the pacific northwest and the other in the midatlantic could refuel nuclearpowered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us   governmentowned shipyards engage in the refueling overhaul and inactivation of ssn688 los angeles class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships the 2012 act required dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2013 act however modified the 2012 act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance the 2013 act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier similarly the 2013 act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law if a us governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the business of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we also compete in the engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on future us   navy engineering proposals including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and future surface combatant and amphibious assault ship programs 

  

our competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have performed 

overcapacity in the us shipbuilding market may reduce our market share or our ability to secure contract awards at profitable prices 

the reduced level of shipbuilding activity by the us   navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 288 ships as of december 31 2012 has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards six major private united states shipyards three of which are our shipyards plus numerous other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair and convert naval vessels we have announced our intention to cease all military shipbuilding operations in our louisiana facilities by the end of 2013 competition for future shipbuilding programs is expected to be intense additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines amphibious assault ships surface combatants and other ships compete for funding with each 

other as well as with other defense products and services future rationalization of shipyard capacity in the united states might occur and we could be affected by shipyard consolidation or closures as a result of the reduced level of us   navy spending on ship construction any further reduction could have a significant effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as a us government contractor we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

us   government contractors must comply with a variety of significant regulations including procurement nuclear and other requirements these regulations and related requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which mandates increased performance and compliance efforts and costs changes in regulations and related requirements can increase our compliance costs and reduce our profit margins 

  

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us   government and its various agencies such as the us   navys supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our contract performance cost structures and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and internal policies systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension and prohibition from doing business with the us   government allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm 

whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us   government has the ability pursuant to recent regulations relating to contractor business systems to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more such systems   we have existing contracts subject to the new contractor business systems regulations and expect our future contracts to be subject to such regulations for our contracts subject to the new regulations   the us government has in certain instances withheld payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems we are modifying our affected business systems to address the us governments concerns     

  

as with other government contractors the us   government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed these recommendations sometimes involve substantial amounts in response to us government audits investigations and inquiries we have on occasion in the past made minor adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts such audits investigations and inquiries may result in reductions of our contract prices in the future 

  

we are also subject from time to time to us   government investigations relating to our operations and we are subject to or are expected to comply with a variety of federal laws including the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act the foreign corrupt practices act and cost accounting standards if we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions in the value of contracts contract modifications or terminations the assessment of penalties and fines or compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting given our dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require certain manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

we design develop and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and intellectual property rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements 

  

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually have new technology that is supplied by the us   navy other contractors or us problems in developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in maintaining the design schedule needed for construction the risk associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery late delivery of information can cause inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

  

our products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement substandard quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments previously received 

  

we have experienced quality issues in the past with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customer these issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover additional quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action such quality issues that might arise in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits or may incur additional costs related to the wind down of military shipbuilding at our louisiana facilities and the consolidation of all ingalls construction into our mississippi facilities 

  

we have announced our intention to wind down military shipbuilding at avondale our louisiana shipyard by the end of 2013 and two louisiana components facilities in 2013 after delivering lpd25 somerset  the san   antonio class ship currently under construction at avondale and consolidate all ingalls military shipbuilding into our mississippi facilities we intend to shift construction of future lpdclass ships to a single production line at our pascagoula shipyard to reduce costs and increase efficiency we cannot provide any assurances that shifting avondale  s military shipbuilding to our pascagoula facility will result in our realization of anticipated benefits from serial production at that facility in connection with the increased utilization of our employees and facilities in our pascagoula shipyard we may encounter difficulties adhering to backtoback production schedules an inability to adhere to production schedules could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely perform our existing contracts and our ability to obtain new contracts in the future moreover the concentration of our ingalls workforce in pascagoula and gulfport may inhibit our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled and trained employees to perform the increased workload in these locations any failure to attract and retain the necessary workforce or to effectively manage and control thirdparty contractors could adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   

we anticipate that we will incur substantial restructuring costs and asset writedowns currently estimated at 256 million  related to the wind down of our operations at avondale we believe that substantially all such expenses will be recoverable under existing flexiblypriced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with far provisions governing the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs the dcaa prepared an initial audit report on our july 30 2010 cost recovery proposal of 310 million which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the dcaa to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately 25 million  or 8  of the costs included in the proposal we then submitted a revised proposal dated october 12 2011 to address the concerns of the dcaa and to reflect a revised estimated total cost of  271 million  we received a supplemental audit report which again stated that the proposal was not sufficiently supported to allow the dcaa to reach a 

conclusion the amount and percentage of questioned costs were materially unchanged from the previous audit report we intend to submit another revised proposal that addresses the dcaa concerns and supports our current restructuring cost estimate of 256 million  

although closure is still the baseline assumption for avondale we are pursuing engineering and manufacturing opportunities in the energy infrastructure market if we are successful in pursuing such opportunities and avondale remains open we would submit a revised restructuring proposal to the us navy consistent with this change in such event we expect that our total estimated restructuring costs would decrease while the restructuring costs that are currently capitalized as incurred consisting primarily of severance and retention payments should remain recoverable under existing or future us navy contracts other avondale costs would remain as part of avondales new line of business 

whether we close avondale entirely or keep the facility open in a new line of business we currently do not have an agreement with the us navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down at avondale we may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down these potential costs of which we are not currently aware and which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time could be significant the actual restructuring expenses we incur in connection with our wind down of avondale including potential environmental costs may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

  

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues the size and nature of many of our contracts makes the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables for new shipbuilding programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction on ships that are not completely designed assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work assumptions must be made for all ship contracts regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions must be made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards and penalties related to contract performance are considered in estimating revenues and profit rates and are recorded when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance 

  

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above to our contract accounting materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon our future financial position results of operations or cash flows see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes floods and environmental disasters such as oil spills although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant natural disasters could disrupt our facilities systems or projects which could interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts in addition should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position  in this section  

  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform their contracts performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on a contract which could 

reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or insurers such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

  

natural disasters can also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operations and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of our performance under our contracts with the us   navy and the us   coast guard 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position 

  

we seek to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss in some but not all circumstances we may be indemnified for losses by the us government subject to the availability of appropriated funds not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example in the case of a catastrophic hurricane in addition the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows even in cases where we have insurance coverage disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

  

approximately 50  of our approximately 37000 employees are covered by a total of nine  collective bargaining agreements newport news has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees which expire in march 2013 april 2014 and june 2014 ingalls has six collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees five of which cover pascagoula and gulfport employees and one of which covers avondale employees the five pascagoulagulfport collective bargaining agreements expire in march 2015 and the avondale collective bargaining agreement was indefinitely extended upon its last expiration 

we must negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties with renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses or delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm returns on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings equity and contributions to our pension and retiree health care plans in future periods 

  

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets variances from these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our assumed longterm return on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding to the plans 

timing differences exist between the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap pension funding requirements and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our 

cash flow from operations on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards cas board issued its final cas harmonization rule the harmonization rule the new rule will impact pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

  

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns or other actions commonly referred to as green initiatives we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations and such costs could be substantial depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions  

  

the nature of shipbuilding operations requires the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits in order to handle these materials our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition handling of these materials sometimes results in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways where we operate our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

  

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

  

environmental laws and regulations also impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the excluded parties list maintained by the general services administration which would continue until the epa concluded that the cause of the violation was cured facilities on the excluded parties list are prohibited from working on any us   government contract 

  

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover related costs under previously priced contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have announced our intention to wind down military shipbuilding at our louisiana facilities which we anticipate will be completed by the end of 2013 our wind down of operations at these facilities may result in environmental costs the amount of which we cannot currently estimate such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial instruments 

  

the financial and credit markets have historically experienced high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we may access these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions and capital expansion projects obtaining credit support for our workers compensation selfinsurance program refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

a tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to meet our contract obligations the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

  

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

  

we have implemented extensive compliance controls policies and procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials security clearance breaches cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy we may not however prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners any improper actions could subject us to civil and criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on us navy and us coast guard contracts we are conducting an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we are providing information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we have agreed with the us navy and us coast guard to a withhold of 24 million in payments on existing contracts pending additional information from our internal investigation some or all of these funds may be released from the withhold based upon the results of the investigation depending upon the us governments assessment of the matters under investigation we could be subject to significant civil penalties criminal fines and suspension or debarment from us government contracting although we do not currently believe that this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new information might come to light in the future and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

  

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us governments proprietary and classified information we could face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities our information 

technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities or other disruptions could expose us to reputational damage potential liability or the loss of current or future contracts including work on sensitive or classified systems for the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

  

the design construction refueling and overhaul repair and inactivation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and nuclearpowered submarines our nuclear facilities used to support such activities and our other nuclear operations at various doe sites and commercial nuclear power plants subject us to various risks including 

 

failure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if an accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions taken in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us   navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending on their assessment of the severity of the situation in addition new or revised security and safety requirements   imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures 

subject to certain requirements and limitations our contracts with the us navy and doe generally provide for indemnity by the us   government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we may not however be indemnified for all liabilities that we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations for our commercial nuclear operations we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators such insurance however may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as part of our business strategy we may from time to time acquire a noncontrolling or controlling interest in a business these investments are made following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective business acquisitions generally involve estimates assumptions and judgments in determining acquisition prices which prices must be allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our analyses due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates 

as of december 31 2012  goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 14  and 9  respectively of our recorded total assets we evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on november   30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate purchased intangibles when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment test is based on several factors requiring 

judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangibles adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our common stock price could also result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangible assets 

  

in light of the adverse equity market conditions that began in the second quarter of 2011 and the resultant decline in industry market multiples and our market capitalization we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2011 as a result we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge totaling 300 million in the third quarter of 2011 which was subsequently reduced to 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 after we completed our impairment analysis 

  

future declines in equity market multiples or the trading price of our common stock or other factors such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins at ingalls could lead to future impairments of goodwill any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

  

as of december 31 2012  the estimated value of our uncertain tax positions was a potential liability of 21 million  which includes accrued interest and penalties if our positions are sustained by the taxing authority in our favor the reversal of the liability would reduce our income tax provision and cost of sales and service revenues however we cannot guarantee that such positions will be sustained in our favor 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over such arrangements and have returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

  

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with business partners in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues we and our joint venture partners may in certain instances fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default by or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners under these joint venture arrangements any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures  

  

operating through joint ventures in which we are the minority holder gives us limited control over many decisions made with respect to the related joint venture projects and internal controls relating to such projects these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that we follow as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture when entering into joint ventures in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns 

we might in the future make strategic acquisitions and investments and these activities involve risks and uncertainties 

in pursuing our business strategies we expect to review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we will have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities   in addition acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty of integrating newlyacquired businesses challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives the potential value impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses if we fail to manage acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions successfully our financial results business and future prospects could be harmed 

  

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position 

  

the size type and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are currently and may in the future become subject to various claims and litigation including environmental claims which if not resolved within accrued reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any claims and litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future the following paragraphs describe pending claims and litigation that if determined adversely for amounts that exceed accrued reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the second quarter of 2007 the us coast guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the deepwater modernization program for eight converted 123foot patrol boats the vessels based on alleged hull buckling and shaft alignment problems and alleged nonconforming topside equipment on the vessels we submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper the us coast guard advised icgs which was formed by us and lockheed martin to perform the deepwater modernization program that it was seeking 96 million  from icgs as a result of the revocation of acceptance the majority of the costs associated with the conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels which were converted under contracts with us and one of our subcontractors in 2008 the us coast guard advised icgs that the us coast guard would support an investigation by the us department of justice of icgs and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its 96 million  claim independently the department of justice conducted an investigation of icgs under a sealed false claims act complaint filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time in february 2009 the district court unsealed the complaint filed by michael j dekort a former lockheed martin employee against us icgs and lockheed martin relating to the vessel conversion effort damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability following the resolution of certain claims between the relator and a codefendant the district court entered a final judgment in march 2011 dismissing the relators remaining claims the relator appealed the dismissal of the remaining claims to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit and in july 2012 the fifth circuit issued a per curiam decision affirming the judgment of the district court dismissing the relator  s remaining claims while we do not believe that remaining issues relating to conversion of the vessels will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in several hundred cases filed in numerous jurisdictions around the country wherein former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated litigation 

  

in january   2011 the us   department of justice first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us   district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint we received alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means we and northrop grumman obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million  plus penalties attorneys fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

on july 31 2012 the district court entered an order permitting us to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint we received including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the us department of justice to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes on december 8 2011 the department of justice filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case 

  

based upon a review to date of the information available to us we believe that we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts and that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit we intend to defend this matter vigorously while we believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete 

  

we own or have the right to use certain patents trademarks copyrights and other forms of intellectual property the us government has rights to use certain intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property our intellectual property is subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties 

  

we also rely upon proprietary technology information processes and knowhow that are not protected by patents we seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants subcontractors and other parties as well as through other security measures these agreements may not however provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information 

in the event our intellectual property rights are infringed we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property litigation to determine the scope of our rights even if successful could be costly and a diversion of managements attention away from other aspects of our business in addition trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 

  

in instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their proprietary intellectual property we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2012  we had 1830 million  of debt and 650 million  of additional borrowing and letter of credit capacity under our credit facility credit facility our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 25 

 

because we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our debt moreover despite our current level of debt we may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future   to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could be increased 

restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes and our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 

in addition the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limits the amount of our capital expenditures and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio among others these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit our strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes these covenants limit the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs these covenants may therefore limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business 

risks related to the spinoff 

  

we may be responsible for us federal income tax liabilities that relate to our spinoff from northrop grumman 

  

our spinoff from northrop grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that northrop grumman northrop grummans stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except with respect to cash received by northrop grummans stockholders in lieu of fractional shares 

  

if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction northrop grumman would recognize a substantial gain for us   federal income tax purposes in such case under irs regulations each member of northrop grummans consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us   federal income tax liability 

  

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction for us   federal income tax purposes the distribution will be taxable to northrop grumman pursuant to section   355e of the internal revenue code if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either northrop grumman or us representing 50 

or more measured by vote or value of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption the tax liability resulting from the application of section   355e would be substantial and under irs regulations each member of the northrop grumman consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us   federal income tax liability 

  

we agreed with northrop grumman as part of the spinoff not to enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to northrop grumman including under section 355e we also agreed to indemnify northrop grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions the amount of any such indemnification could be substantial in addition these obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

  

our spinoff from northrop grumman may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws 

  

a court could determine that northrop grumman did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other actions as part of the spinoff or that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness including the debt incurred by us in connection with the spinoff transferring assets or taking other actions as part of the spinoff and at the time of such actions we or northrop grumman i   were insolvent or would be rendered insolvent ii   had reasonably small capital with which to carry on our respective businesses and all businesses in which we intended to engage or iii   intended to incur or believed we would incur debts beyond our ability to repay such debts as they would mature in such event the court could void the spinoff as a constructive fraudulent transfer if such court made this determination the court could impose a number of different remedies including voiding our liens and claims against northrop grumman or providing northrop grumman with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by northrop grumman and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spinoff 

  

in connection with the spinoff northrop grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the respective business or businesses that we own and operate following the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to northrop grumman such as certain tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if northrop grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform its allocated obligations 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our indebtedness could limit our future ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

  

our dividend policy is established by our board of directors based upon our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt or debt that we may incur in the future may limit or prohibit payments of dividends in addition the amount of our existing and any additional future debt may limit our ability to pay dividends if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends even if declared by our board of directors may be impaired there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend on our common stock 

  

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

  

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable for example our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals cause delays 

or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

  

we agreed with northrop grumman in connection with our spinoff not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition including issuance of our common stock or any other transaction or to the extent we have the right to prohibit it to permit any such transaction that could reasonably be expected to cause the spinoff to be taxable to northrop grumman we also agreed to indemnify northrop grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions generally northrop grumman will recognize taxable gain on the spinoff if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of our capital stock directly or indirectly representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of our then outstanding capital stock and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any such shares of our common stock acquired directly or indirectly within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption the amount of any indemnification payment we may be required to pay to northrop grumman resulting from any such transactions could be substantial 

  

our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us   navy consequently the us navy has required us to include in our contracts with the navy express terms regarding notice and approval rights in the event of change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the navys obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear work for the navy such terms require us to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the navys consent for transferring certain related licenses to facilitate the navy  s ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we have included such terms in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work   and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the navy for nuclear work  

  

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws our obligations to northrop grumman relating to the spinoff and our existing contracts with the us navy may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

there were no unresolved staff comments 




 item 2 properties 

at december 31 2012  we had operations in san diego california avondale new orleans louisiana gulfport and pascagoula mississippi and hampton newport news and suffolk virginia we also lease andor own office buildings related to our operations in both virginia beach virginia and washington dc 

  

ingalls  the three properties comprising our ingalls operations are located in pascagoula and gulfport mississippi and avondale louisiana we also have a facility in waggaman louisiana but we ceased significant operations there in 2011 in addition our cmsd facilities in san diego california and our amsec facilities in virginia beach virginia are part of our ingalls operations 

  

our pascagoula shipyard is a primary provider of major surface warships to the us navy and has modernized dozens of other naval ships it is the only us shipyard in recent years to be developing and building six different classes of ships for the us navy and us coast guard our facilities in pascagoula are located on approximately 800 acres on the banks of the pascagoula river where it flows into the mississippi sound we lease the west bank of our pascagoula shipyard from the state of mississippi pursuant to a 99year lease consisting of a 40year base term plus six optional terms we anticipate continued use of this facility for the remaining 54 years on the lease and beyond 

our components facility in gulfport mississippi sits on approximately 120 acres and focuses on composite research and engineering the facility is currently building the ddg1000 composite deckhouses and lpd composite masts we believe that this composite capability coupled with strong alliances with several universities and suppliers positions us to take advantage of any shift toward lighterweight topside composite structures in us naval and us coast guard applications 

  

our avondale shipyard is located on approximately 268 acres on the banks of the mississippi river approximately 12 miles upriver from downtown new orleans approximately 20 of the avondale shipyard is leased from several third parties the leases have varying expiration dates and typically contain renewal rights the avondale shipyard site has the capacity to manufacture large amphibious assault and military and commercial transport vessels and includes three outfitting docks totaling more than 6000 linear feet in addition to the shipyard the avondale facilities include the maritime technology center of excellence we intend to wind down military shipbuilding at avondale in 2013 and consolidate all such activities in our pascagoula shipyard 

our san diego california and virginia beach virginia facilities provide fleet support services 

newport news  our facilities in newport news virginia are located on approximately 550 acres that we own near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the premier deepwater harbor on the east coast of the united states our newport news shipyard is one of the largest in the united states it is the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy the shipyard also provides services for naval and commercial vessels its facilities include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers module outfitting facilities and various other shops 

  

our newport news shipyard also has a variety of other facilities including an 18acre allweather steel fabrication shop accessible by both rail and transporter module outfitting facilities that enable us to assemble a ships basic structural modules indoors and on land machine shops totaling 300000 square feet and an apprentice school which provides a fouryear accredited apprenticeship program to train shipbuilders 

  

we believe that substantially all of our plants and equipment are in general well maintained and in good operating condition we believe they are adequate for present needs and as supplemented by planned construction are expected to remain adequate for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims  departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or a division or subdivision any suspension or debarment would likely have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in january 2013 we disclosed to the dod including the us navy and the us department of homeland security including the us coast guard pursuant to the far that we had initiated an internal investigation regarding whether certain employees at ingalls mischarged time or misstated progress on us navy and us coast guard contracts we are conducting an internal investigation led by external counsel and have taken remedial actions including the termination of employees in instances where we believed grounds for termination existed we are providing information regarding our investigation to the relevant government agencies we have agreed with the us navy and us coast guard to a withhold of 24 million in payments on existing contracts pending additional information from our internal investigation some or all of these funds may be released from the withhold based upon the results of the investigation depending upon the us governments assessment of the matters under investigation we could be subject to significant civil penalties criminal fines and suspension or debarment from us government contracting although we do not currently believe that this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new information might come to light in the future and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 

  

in the second quarter of 2007 the us coast guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the deepwater modernization program for eight converted 123foot patrol boats the vessels based on alleged hull buckling and shaft alignment problems and alleged nonconforming topside equipment on the vessels we submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper the us coast guard advised icgs which was formed by us and lockheed martin to perform the deepwater modernization program that it was seeking 96 million  from icgs as a result of the revocation of acceptance the majority of the costs associated with the conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels which were converted under contracts with us and one of our subcontractors in 2008 the us coast guard advised icgs that the us coast 

guard would support an investigation by the us department of justice of icgs and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its 96 million  claim independently the us department of justice conducted an investigation of icgs under a sealed false claims act complaint filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time in february 2009 the district court unsealed the complaint filed by michael j dekort a former lockheed martin employee against us icgs and lockheed martin relating to the vessel conversion effort damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability following the resolution of certain claims between the relator and a codefendant the district court entered a final judgment in march 2011 dismissing the relators remaining claims the relator appealed the dismissal of the remaining claims to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit and in july 2012 the fifth circuit issued a per curiam  decision affirming the judgment of the district court dismissing the relators remaining claims following dismissal of the relators claims we do not believe that remaining issues relating to our conversion of the vessels will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot however predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

  

litigation  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business although we believe that the resolution of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters 

  

we are pursuing legal action against an insurance provider fm global arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina the case was commenced against fm global on november 4 2005 and is now pending in the us district court for the central district of california western division in an interlocutory appeal the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the fm global excess policy unambiguously excludes damage from the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina under its flood exclusion and remanded the case to the us district court to determine whether the california efficient proximate cause doctrine afforded coverage under the policy even if the flood exclusion of the policy is unambiguous in august 2010 the us district court granted fm globals motion for summary judgment based upon californias doctrine of efficient proximate cause and denied fm globals motion for summary judgment based upon breach of contract finding that triable issues of fact remained as to whether and to what extent we sustained wind damage apart from the hurricane storm surge in september 2011 the us district court granted fm globals motion for summary judgment to dismiss the claims for bad faith damages and for contract reformation we intend to continue to pursue the breach of contract action against fm global and trial on the merits is currently scheduled to start in october 2013 in addition in january 2011 northrop grumman as our predecessorininterest filed suit against aon which acted as our broker in connection with the policy with fm global in superior court in california seeking damages for breach of contract professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation as well as for declaratory relief the aon matter is currently scheduled for trial to begin in february 2014 no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these matters if however either of these claims is successful the potential impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows would be favorable 

on january 31 2011 the us department of justice first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint the complaint that was filed under seal in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint that we received alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means northrop grumman and we obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million  plus penalties attorneys fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

  

on july 31 2012 the district court entered an order permitting the company to disclose certain information not included in the redacted copy of the complaint received by the company including the date the complaint was filed the decision of the us department of justice to decline intervention in the case and the principal parties involved in the case the complaint was filed on june 2 2010 by relators gerald m fisher and donald c holmes on december 8 2011 the department of justice filed a notice of election to decline intervention in the case as of august 29 2012 gerald m fisher was no longer a relator in or party to this case 

based upon a review to date of the information available to us we believe that we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of 

understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts and that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit we therefore believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we intend to defend the matter vigorously but we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

  

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in several hundred cases filed in numerous jurisdictions around the country wherein former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestosrelated conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named as defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation

overview 

our business 

for more than a century we have designed built overhauled and repaired ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard hii is organized into two operating segments ingalls and newport news which represent our reportable segments through our ingalls segment we are the sole builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters for the us coast guard and one of only two companies that builds the navys current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers through our newport news segment we are the nations sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy we are one of the nations leading fullservice providers for the design engineering construction and life cycle support of major surface ship programs for the us navy we conduct substantially all of our business with the us government principally the dod as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs 

the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

in august 2011 the budget control act reduced the dod top line budget by 487 billion over the next decade starting in 2013 additionally if congress does not identify savings to reduce the us deficit by up to 12 trillion the budget control act could lead to the implementation of sequestration imposing up to 500 billion in additional cuts to defense spending and an additional 500 billion reduction to nondefense discretionary programs including the us coast guard from 2013 to 2021 the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january 2 2013 delayed the implementation of sequestration to march 1 2013 at this time congress has not identified the required savings and the delay in sequestration leaves the dod less time to enact the 2013 automatic spending cuts adding to the uncertainty from such cuts while the specific effects of sequestration remain unknown should sequestration be implemented in march 2013 the resulting funding reductions could have material consequences for our business employee base facilities and suppliers 

us government operations including defense programs for fiscal year 2013 are being funded under a cr which expires on march 27 2013 the cr generally provides funding at fiscal year 2012 levels and restricts new contract starts which impacts some of the programs in which we participate it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed for fiscal year 2013 the us government may operate under a cr for all of fiscal year 2013 potentially resulting in no new contract or program starts for the fiscal year the federal debt ceiling is also expected to be reached in the first half of 2013 congress and the administration continue to debate these issues and the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans we are currently unable to predict the future impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows including revenues goodwill and longlived assets 

defense industry overview 

  

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations and peacekeeping we believe that the us government will continue to 

place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in february 2010 the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr emphasized four key strategic priorities prevailing in todays wars preventing and deterring conflict preparing to defeat adversaries in a wide range of contingencies and preserving and enhancing the allvolunteer force 

we expect that the nations engagement in a multifront multidecade struggle will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while facing additional potential major budget cuts beginning in 2013 the base defense budget is expected to decline through 2015 unless congress and the administration can reach agreement on an alternative spending plan 

the us navy recently released its 2013 force structure assessment which sets forth a comprehensive description of the current requirement for us navy combatant vessels including submarines the report is consistent with the defense strategic guidance issued by the president and secretary of defense in 2012 the 2013 force structure assessment includes a baseline force of 306 ships similar to the quantity of 313 ships that was proposed by the us navy to congress in the 2005 force structure assessment and revalidated in 2010 since 2010 however several actions have impacted us navy force structure requirements including the defense strategic guidance was issued in 2012 operational plans were reexamined shipbuilding programs were changed ship employment cycles were modified and global posture forward was increased based on the 2012 defense strategic guidance the 306ship combatant force possesses the requisite capability and capacity to deliver credible deterrence sea control and power projection to deter or contain conflict and if called upon to fight and win our nations wars major elements of the force include 

 

it is anticipated that the us navy will submit a shipbuilding plan to congress concurrent with the fiscal year 2014 presidents budget request that will provide additional details regarding the force structure of 306 ships 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is highly capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industrys customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the us navys new lcs the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod announced various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors the most recent initiatives are organized into five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy these initiatives are relatively new and the specific impacts on our industry will be understood better as the dod implements them further see risks related to our business in item 1a 

program descriptions 

  

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our revenues from longterm government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

 

 

contract fees  negotiated contract fee structures for both flexiblypriced and firm fixedprice contracts include fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees  certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these areas it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

  

overview  we derive the majority of our revenues from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

  

percentageofcompletion accounting  we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior 

periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended   december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  favorable and unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were as follows 



for the year ended   december 31 2012  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily the result of risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise  edsra as well as the receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily related to higher than expected costs to complete lpd24 arlington as well as increased workers compensation expense driven by discount rates 

for the year ended   december 31 2011  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily the result of risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and lpd23 anchorage  unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments in 2011 were primarily related to lower performance on lpd22 uss san diego  and lpd24 arlington  

for the year ended   december 31 2010  favorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily driven by risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program and our aircraft carrier programs during the same period unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily due to higher expected costs to complete lpd23 anchorage  and lpd25 somerset  resulting from the decision to cease military shipbuilding at avondale and lower performance on lpd22 uss san diego  and lpd24 arlington  as well as increased costs to complete lhd8 uss makin island  

cost estimation  the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact of the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

other considerations  defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan retirement related benefit plans benefit costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon cas the cas requirements for retirement related benefit plans costs differ from the financial accounting standards fas requirements given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the cas and fas requirements to determine specific recoverability we have not estimated the incremental fas income or expense recoverable under our expected future contract activity and therefore did not defer any fas expense for retirement related benefit plans this resulted in a fas expense in excess of cas expense of 80 million  23 million  and 56 million  for the years ended   december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill at both december 31 2012  and 2011  was 881 million  

tests for impairment  we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2012 impairment test  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2012 and determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value 

  

litigation commitments and contingencies 

  

overview  we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

environmental accruals  we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

  

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of both december 31 2012  and 2011  were 25 million  and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 

  

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2012  due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

litigation accruals  litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

uncertain tax positions  uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense we also recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes see note 11 income taxes in item 8 under existing gaap changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related plans 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the allocation to and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services and the methodology to determine such costs fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use longterm assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs 

the cash funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa which is primarily based on the years expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below different funded percentages as defined by the internal revenue code among various items we consider both the minimum funding requirements and the funded status of each plan from the perspective of potential benefit restrictions in developing our contribution schedule in a given year 

during 2012 the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 was enacted included in map21 are provisions for potential relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that are used to determine minimum funding requirements the relief derived from these provisions will be phased out to lower levels over the next few years we consider the effects of legislation such as map21 in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding on the level of contributions to make to our plans each year 

we record cas retirement related benefits expense in the results of our business segments and we include the fas expense for these benefits in total operating income under gaap due to the differences between fas and cas amounts we also present the difference between fas and cas expense referred to as our fascas adjustment to reconcile segment operating income to total operating income on a consolidated basis under gaap 

due to the foregoing differences in requirements and calculation methodologies our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow problem on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule the harmonization rule the harmonization rule is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa the harmonization rule became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under the harmonization rule only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 reflect the effects of the rule the harmonization rule will affect pension costs on contracts with initial effects beginning in 2013 we expect that it will result in increased pension costs allocable to our contracts with greater impacts beginning to phase in during 2014 

assumption s  we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas the measurements of obligations costs assets and liabilities require significant judgment the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

discount rate  the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans   benefit obligations could be effectively settled the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars are rated aa or better by at least half of the available ratings provided by up to four nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 50 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or index linked since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 424  and 523  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 404  and 494  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

expected longterm rate of return  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes interest rates inflation portfolio volatility investment management and administrative fees and risk management strategies while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views to avoid shortterm market influences in order to reflect expected lower future market returns we have reduced the expected longterm rate of return assumption from 800 used to record 2012  expense to 750 for 2013  the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower asset class returns for long bonds and to a lesser extent for equities unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 

differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants which is approximately 10 years in 2012  the actual return on assets was approximately 12 which was higher than the expected return assumption of 800 for the year ended december 31 2012  the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 99 and 90 basis points respectively these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in a combined net actuarial loss of approximately 699 million 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 



cas expense  in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption unlike fas cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changes infrequently given its longterm nature as a result changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas in addition unlike under fas we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements   

other fas and cas considerations   a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized over the employees average future service life of approximately 10 years under cas net gains and losses are amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under the harmonization rule the amortization period for cas will change to 10 years for gains and losses experienced beginning in 2013 both fas and cas use a marketrelated value of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically spread over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this spreading method and instead use fair value in determining our fas costs accordingly fas expense generally reflects recent gains and losses faster than cas 

additionally cas expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas expense will change accordingly we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as actual calendar year plan asset returns actual census data as of the end of the prior year and other actual and projected experience 

the fascas adjustment in 2012  was a net expense of 80 million  as compared to a net expense of 23 million  in 2011  the unfavorable  change was driven by an increase in our fas expense due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate assumption   the fascas adjustment in 2011  was a net expense of 23 million  as compared to a net expense of 56 million  in 2010  the favorable  change was driven by a decrease in our fas expense due primarily to favorable asset returns in 2010 coupled with offsetting higher cas costs primarily due to demographics 

retirement plan assets  retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds and real estate investments are generally valued at their net asset values nav or equivalent 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav for the very limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value 

accumulated other comprehensive income  we record in accumulated other comprehensive income unrecognized gains and losses as well as unrecognized prior service costs and credits arising from our retirement related plans as disclosed in note 16 employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8 net pretax unrecognized losses as of december 31 2012  and 2011  were 1980 million  and 1359 million  respectively these net deferred losses primarily originated from changes in the discount rate differences between estimated and expected asset returns and changes in demographic experience the increase in these deferred losses in 2012  was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rates for 828 million partially offset by 2012  actual asset returns being 129 million higher than expected and 90 million of amortization of previously recognized losses 

net pretax unrecognized prior service costs as of december 31 2012  and 2011  were 48 million  and 64 million  respectively these net deferred costs primarily originated from plan amendments including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs and credits in 2012  resulted from a favorable 11 million plan amendment and 5 million of amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs 

the amortization period for qualifying unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized gainslosses is the estimated remaining service lives of our employees which is approximately 10 years 

workers compensation 

  

our operations are subject to federal and state workers compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers compensation plans in addition to participating in federally administered second injury workers compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors we periodically and at least annually update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis related selfinsurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported during the year ended december 31 2012  we recorded 34 million in workers compensation expense due to a lower discount rate of 159 our workers compensation liability was discounted at 159  and 305  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate the workers compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 719 million  and 739 million  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

accounting standards updates 

  

there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective nor made effective during the year ended december 31 2012  that are of significance to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the following table 



  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments referred to in this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexiblypriced which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance under far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues as well as operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap this approach is consistent with the longterm life cycle of our contracts as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion consequently our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing our business 

cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consist of materials labor and subcontracting costs as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

2012   product sales in 2012   increased   79 million  or 1  from 2011  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased by 10 million in 2012  as a result of lower sales volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher sales volumes in surface combatants and the legend class nsc program newport news product sales increased by 89 million in 2012  due to higher sales volumes in aircraft carrier programs partially offset by lower sales volumes in submarine programs 

service revenues in 2012   increased   54 million  or 6  from 2011  service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased by 31 million in 2012  primarily as a result of lower volumes in surface combatant support services service revenues at our newport news segment increased by 85 million in 2012  due to the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise extended drydocking selected restricted availability edsra and higher volumes in energy services aircraft carrier and submarine related engineering services and fleet support services 

2011   product sales in 2011   decreased   122 million  or 2  from 2010  product sales at our ingalls segment decreased by 183 million primarily as a result of lower revenues in surface combatants partially offset by higher revenues in amphibious assault ship programs and the legend class nsc program newport news product sales increased by 61 million in 2011  due to higher sales volumes in aircraft carrier and submarine construction programs partially offset by lower sales volumes in our rcoh program 

service revenues in 2011   decreased   26 million  or 3  from 2010  service revenues at our ingalls segment increased by 44 million in 2011  primarily as a result of higher volumes in our fleet support services service revenues at our newport news segment decreased by 70 million in 2011  primarily due to lower volumes in aircraft carrier related engineering and fleet support services 

cost of sales and service revenues 

cost of product sales cost of service revenues income from operating investments net and general and administrative expenses were as follows 



cost of product sales   

2012   cost of product sales in 2012   increased   33 million  or 1  as compared to 2011  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 26 million in 2012  primarily as a result of the lower sales volumes described above improved performance on the lpd17 san antonio class program as well as receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party partially offset by increased workers compensation expense cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 59 million in 2012  primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above and increased workers compensation expense cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined  from 845  in 2011  to 839  in 2012  primarily due to improved overall performance at our ingalls segment 

2011   cost of product sales in 2011   decreased   248 million  or 5  as compared to 2010  cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased 309 million as a result of the lower sales volumes described above and a pretax charge of 113 million recognized in 2010 resulting from our decision to wind down military shipbuilding at our avondale facility in 2013 see note 4 avondale in item 8 cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased 61 million primarily due to higher sales volumes on lower margin programs partially offset by risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined from 870  in 2010  to 845  in 2011  primarily due to the nonrecurring 113 million pretax charge recognized in 2010 for the wind down of military shipbuilding at our avondale facility 

cost of service revenues   

2012   cost of service revenues in 2012   increased   25 million  or 3  as compared to 2011  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment decreased 24 million in 2012  as a result of the lower volumes described above cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased 49 million in 2012  as a result of the higher volumes described above cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined  from 864  in 2011  to 842  in 2012  primarily due to the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra as well as yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2011    cost of service revenues in 2011   decreased   12 million  or approximately 2  from 2010  cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased 40 million due to higher sales volumes in fleet support services cost of service revenues at our newport news segment decreased 52 million as a result of lower sales volumes in aircraft carrier related engineering and fleet support services the modest increase  in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues from 853  in 2010  to 864  in 2011  was the result of normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

income loss from operating investments net 

the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income 

2012   income from operating investments net decreased   2 million  or 10  to 18 million  in 2012  from 20 million  in 2011  the decrease was primarily driven by reduced work in 2012 funded by the american reinvestment and recovery act at our savannah river nuclear solutions llc investment 

2011    income from operating investments net increased  by 1 million  or 5  to 20 million  in 2011  from 19 million  in 2010  the components of income from operating investments net were consistent in 2011  and 2010  

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2012   general and administrative expenses in 2012   increased   105 million  or 17  from 2011  this increase  was primarily the result of increases in the fascas adjustment and deferred state income tax expenses 

2011    general and administrative expenses in 2011   decreased   36 million  or 5  from 2010  this decrease  was due principally to a lower fascas adjustment 

goodwill impairment 

as discussed above in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

2012   we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2012  

2011    we recorded a net goodwill impairment charge in 2011 of 290 million in our ingalls segment see note 9 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 we did not record any goodwill impairment charge during 2010  

operating income 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income segment operating income is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

the following table reconciles segment operating income to total operating income 



segment operating income 

2012   segment operating income in 2012  was 457 million  as compared to 122 million  in 2011  the increase  was primarily the result of the absence in 2012 of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2011 improved overall performance at our ingalls segment and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by increased workers compensation expense 

2011   segment operating income in 2011  was 122 million  as compared to 294 million  in 2010  the decrease  was primarily the result of the 2011 goodwill impairment charge described above partially offset by the 113 million pretax charge recognized in 2010 resulting from our decision to wind down military shipbuilding at our avondale facility 

activity within each segment is discussed in segment operating results below 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our pension and postretirement plan expense under fas and under cas 



2012   the fascas adjustment in 2012  was a net expense of 80 million  as compared to a net expense of 23 million  in 2011  the unfavorable  change was driven by an increase in our fas expense due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate assumption 

2011   the fascas adjustment in 2011  was a net expense of 23 million  as compared to a net expense of 56 million  in 2010  the favorable  change was driven by a decrease in our fas expense due primarily to favorable asset returns in 2010 coupled with offsetting higher cas costs primarily due to demographics 

we expect the fascas adjustment in 2013  to be a net expense of approximately 70 million to 100 million the expected fascas adjustment is subject to update during 2013 when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with final 2012 asset returns and census data and possibly for any potential changes to our plans that might be subject to collective bargaining during 2013 

deferred state income taxes 

deferred state income taxes reflect the changes in deferred state tax assets and liabilities in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income while the current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2012   the deferred state income taxes expense  in 2012  was 19 million  compared to a benefit  of 1 million  in 2011  the increase was primarily due to the timing of contract related income spinoff related adjustments and pension related deductions 

2011   the benefit provided by deferred state income taxes in 2011  was 1 million  compared to a benefit  of 3 million  in 2010  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of contract related income and deductions 

interest expense 

2012   interest expense in 2012  was 117 million  compared to 104 million  in 2011  the increase  was primarily due to a full year of interest in 2012 on our senior notes and indebtedness under the credit facility partially offset by the elimination of intercompany indebtedness to northrop grumman in connection with the spinoff 

2011   interest expense in 2011  was 104 million  compared to 40 million  in 2010  the increase  was primarily due to interest expense on our senior notes and our credit facility established in connection with the spinoff these increases were partially offset by the elimination of intercompany indebtedness to northrop grumman as of march 30 2011 

other net   

2012   there were no significant transactions recorded in other net during 2012  

2011    there were no significant transactions recorded in other net during 2011  compared to the 2 million  net expense  recorded in 2010  

federal income taxes   

2012    our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 394  in 2012  compared to 336  in 2011  excluding the 2011 noncash goodwill impairment charge of 290 million which is nondeductible for income tax purposes the increase in our effective tax rate for 2012  compared to 2011  was primarily the result of 8 million in noncash tax adjustments arising under our tax matters agreement with northrop grumman which requires indemnification between us and northrop grumman for aggregate tax adjustments exceeding a certain threshold for periods prior to the spinoff see note 11 income taxes in item 8 our effective tax rate can also differ from the federal statutory rate as a result of nondeductible expenditures the research and development tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction our effective tax rate for 2012  does not reflect the income tax benefit for the research and development  tax credit which expired at the end of 2011  the american taxpayer relief act which was signed into law on january 2 2013 retroactively extends the research and development tax credit  through the end of 2013 due to the timing of enactment the impact on our effective tax rate will be reflected in 2013  

2011   our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 336  excluding the goodwill impairment charge in 2011  compared to 342  in 2010  the effective tax rate for 2011  was lower than 2010 due to higher domestic manufacturing deductions research and development credits and the noncash tax adjustments in 2011 related to our tax matters agreement with northrop grumman see note 11 income taxes in item 8 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into two reportable segments ingalls and newport news 



key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

ingalls 



sales and service revenues   

2012   ingalls revenues including intersegment sales decreased   45 million  or 2  in   2012  compared to 2011  as a result of lower sales volumes in amphibious assault ships partially offset by higher sales volumes in the legend class nsc program the decrease in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to lower sales following the deliveries of lpd23 anchorage  and lpd24 arlington  in 2012 and following the delivery of lpd22 uss san diego in 2011 partially offset by higher sales volume on lha7 tripoli  lpd27 unnamed lpd26 john p murtha  and lpd25 somerset  the increase in revenues on the legend class nsc program was the result of higher sales volume on the construction of nsc4 hamilton  and nsc5 joshua james  and the advance procurement contract on nsc6 unnamed partially offset by lower sales resulting from the delivery of nsc3 uscgc stratton in 2011 surface combatants revenues remained stable as higher sales on the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer construction program driven by higher sales on ddg114 ralph johnson  partially offset by lower sales on ddg110 uss william p lawrence delivered in 2011 as well as higher sales on the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer program were offset by lower revenues in surface combatants support services 

2011   ingalls revenues decreased   142 million  or 5  in 2011  compared to 2010  the decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues in surface combatants partially offset by higher revenues in amphibious assault ships programs and the legend class nsc program the decrease in surface combatants revenues was primarily due to lower revenues on the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer construction program following the delivery of ddg110 uss william p lawrence  in the first quarter of 2011 and ddg107 uss gravely  in the third quarter of 2010 partially offset by higher revenues on ddg113 john finn  in 2011 the increase in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to higher revenues on lpd26 john p murtha  and the lha6 america class program partially offset by lower revenues on lpd22 uss san diego  and lpd24 arlington  the increased revenue on the legend class nsc program was primarily due to higher revenues on nsc4 hamilton  for which the contract was awarded in the fourth quarter of 2010 partially offset by lower revenues on nsc3 uscgc stratton  which was delivered in the third quarter of 2011 

segment operating income 

2012   ingalls operating income  in 2012  was 97 million  compared to a loss  of 220 million  in 2011  the increase  was primarily due to the absence in 2012 of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2011 improved overall performance and the receipt of 7 million in resolution of a contract dispute with a private party partially offset by increased workers compensation expense 

2011   ingalls operating loss  in 2011  was 220 million  compared to a loss  of 61 million  in 2010  the higher loss was primarily the result of the 2011 goodwill impairment charge previously described partially offset by the 113 million pretax charge in 2010 resulting from our decision to wind down military shipbuilding at our avondale facility 

newport news 



sales and service revenues 

2012   newport news revenues including intersegment sales increased   174 million  or 5  in   2012  compared to 2011  primarily driven by higher sales volumes in aircraft carrier programs energy and fleet support services partially offset by lower sales volumes in submarine programs the increase in aircraft carriers was primarily due to higher revenues on the construction contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  the advance construction contract for cvn79 john f kennedy  the advance planning contract for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by lower revenues on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh and an engineering contract for cvn78 gerald r ford  energy services revenues were higher due to maintenance services at the kesselring site fleet support revenues increased due primarily to increased maintenance work on inservice aircraft carriers the decrease in submarine program revenues was the result of lower sales volumes on the ssn774 virginia class submarine construction program due to the timing of procurement of production materials 

2011   newport news revenues remained stable at 3766 million  in 2011  compared to 3775 million  in 2010  lower revenues in aircraft carriers and fleet support were offset by higher revenues in submarines the decrease in aircraft carriers revenues was primarily due to lower revenues on the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh the cvn65 uss enterprise  edsra and the post shakedown availability psa for cvn77 uss george hw bush  these decreases in aircraft carriers revenues were partially offset by higher revenues on cvn78 gerald r ford  the advance construction contract for cvn79 john f kennedy and   the advance planning contract for cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh the decrease in fleet support revenues was primarily driven by lower activity in the san diego fleet maintenance market the increase in submarines revenues was primarily due to higher revenues on the construction of ssn774 virginia class submarines 

segment operating income 

2012   newport news operating income  in 2012  was 360 million  compared to income  of 342 million  in 2011  the increase  was due primarily to the increased sales volumes described above favorable performance on the execution contract for the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh and the favorable resolution of outstanding contract changes on the cvn65 uss enterprise edsra partially offset by higher workers compensation expense 

  

2011   newport news operating income  in 2011  was 342 million  compared to income  of 355 million  in 2010  the decrease was primarily due to higher revenues on lower margin programs and risk retirement on cvn70 uss carl vinson  and cvn77 uss george hw bush  that occurred in 2010 partially offset by risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program in 2011 

backlog 

total backlog at december 31 2012  was approximately 16 billion  total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at december 31 2012  and 2011  



approximately 31  of the 16 billion  total backlog at december 31 2012  is expected to be converted into sales in 2013  us government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  

awards 

2012   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2012  was approximately 60 billion significant new awards in 2012  included contracts for the detail design and construction of lha7 tripoli  detail design and construction of lpd27 unnamed planning efforts for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh and continued longlead time procurement and construction preparation for cvn79 john f kennedy  

2011   the value of new contract awards during the year ended   december 31 2011  was approximately 56 billion significant new awards in 2011  included contracts for the construction of lpd26 john p murtha  ddg113 john finn  and ddg114 ralph johnson  continued engineering and construction of cvn78 gerald r ford  advance construction of cvn79 john f kennedy construction of nsc5 joshua james  advance planning efforts for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  rcoh and continued execution of the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt  rcoh 

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities 



  

cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  as classified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2012   cash provided by  operating activities was 332 million  in 2012  compared to 528 million  in 2011  the decrease  of 196 million  was due primarily to increases in retirement benefit funding and trade working capital offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes the change in trade working capital was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventoried costs in 2012  we paid net cash of 28 million  for federal and state income taxes 

we expect cash generated from operations in 2013  to be sufficient to service debt meet contract obligations and finance capital expenditures although 2013  cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations we may from time to time borrow funds under our credit facility to accommodate timing differences in cash flows 

2011   cash provided by  operating activities was 528 million  in 2011  compared with 359 million  in 2010  the increase of 169 million  was due principally to increased earnings net of impairment charges and lower pension contributions offset by an increase in trade working capital net cash paid by northrop grumman on our behalf for us federal income tax obligations was 53 million 

investing activities 

2012   cash used in  investing activities was 162 million  in 2012  consisting entirely of capital expenditures a decrease  of 35 million  from 2011  this decrease resulted primarily from a onetime reimbursement to the state of louisiana in 2011 related to the avondale wind down we expect our capital expenditures in 2013  to fall in a range between 2 and 3 of annual revenues 

2011   cash used in  investing activities was 197 million  in 2011  consisting entirely of capital expenditures 

2010   cash used in  investing activities was 189 million  in 2010  which was principally for capital expenditures 

financing activities 

2012   cash used in  financing activities in 2012  was 28 million  which resulted from 29 million  of debt repayment and 6 million of stockholder distributions offset by 7 million  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

2011   cash provided by  financing activities in 2011  was 584 million  our cash flow from financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of 1775 million  of debt of which 22 million  was repaid in 2011 a 1266 million  net transfer from our former parent and 2 million  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by 54 million  of debt issuance costs repayment of 954 million  of notes to our former parent and a contribution of 1429 million  to northrop grumman as a result of the spinoff 

2010   in anticipation of the spinoff on november 30 2010 ngsb purchased 178 million of the outstanding principal amount of gulf opportunity zone industrial development revenue bonds go zone irbs pursuant to a tender offer ngsb used the proceeds of an intercompany loan for 178 million with northrop grumman to purchase the go zone irbs and submitted the purchased bonds to the trustee for cancellation see note 12 debt in item 8 

for the year ended december 31 2010 transactions between northrop grumman and us were reflected as effectively settled for cash at the time of the transaction and are included in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows the net effect of these transactions is reflected in former parents equity in unit in our consolidated statements of changes in equity 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe investors consider free cash flow to be a useful measure of our performance because it indicates the total cash available for redeployment we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



retirement related plan contributions 

we make both minimum and discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension plans erisa defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans we consider various elements including the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by the actual return on plan assets and the plans funded status we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  



 

we made minimum and discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling 236 million  in 2012  we were not required to make minimum contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2011 or 2010 

we expect our 2013  cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to range from 270 million  to 330 million  all of which will be discretionary 

other postretirement benefit contributions were 31 million  33 million  and 33 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we expect our 2013  contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately 38 million

 item 1 business 

the spinoff 

on march 31 2011 northrop grumman corporation “northrop grumman” completed the spinoff of huntington ingalls industries inc herein referred to as “hii” the “company” “we” “us” or “our” and as the context requires including our predecessor business as a subsidiary of northrop grumman from northrop grumman following which we became an independent publiclyowned company to complete the spinoff northrop grumman distributed to its stockholders of record on march 30 2011 the record date for the distribution all shares of our common stock held by northrop grumman northrop grumman stockholders received one share of hii common stock for every six shares of northrop grumman common stock they held 

as an independent publiclyowned company we own and operate the legacy northrop grumman shipbuilding business we entered into a series of agreements with northrop grumman including the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements which govern the relationship between us and northrop grumman subsequent to the spinoff and provide for the allocation between northrop grumman and us of various assets liabilities and obligations including employee benefits intellectual property insurance and tax related assets and liabilities 

history and organization 

for more than a century we have been designing building overhauling and repairing ships primarily for the us navy and the us coast guard we build more ships in more ship types and classes than any other us naval shipbuilder we are the nation’s sole industrial designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers the sole supplier and builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships to the us navy the sole builder of national security cutters for the us coast guard one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and one of only two companies that builds the us navy’s current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers we are the exclusive provider of refueling and complex overhaul “rcoh” services for nuclearpowered aircraft carriers a fullservice systems provider for the design engineering construction and life cycle support of major programs for surface ships and a provider of fleet support and maintenance services for the us navy 

our primary areas of business include the design construction repair and maintenance of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants expeditionary warfareamphibious assault and coastal defense surface ships as well as the overhaul and refueling of nuclearpowered ships we operate our shipbuilding business through our huntington ingalls incorporated subsidiary which is organized into two segments newport news shipbuilding “newport news” which includes all of our nuclear ship design construction overhaul refueling and repair and maintenance businesses and ingalls shipbuilding “ingalls” which includes our nonnuclear ship design construction repair and maintenance businesses 

our three major shipyards are currently located in newport news virginia pascagoula mississippi and avondale louisiana we currently intend to wind down our construction activities at our avondale shipyard in 2013 and consolidate ingalls construction into our mississippi facilities we believe that consolidation in pascagoula will allow us to realize the benefits of serial production reduce program costs on existing contracts and make future vessels more affordable by reducing overhead rates thereby making us more competitive on future us navy and us coast guard contracts we are exploring the potential for alternative uses of the avondale facility including alternative opportunities for the workforce there for a more detailed discussion of the costs that we expect to incur in connection with the wind down of our avondale shipyard see risk factors in item 1a 

we conduct substantially all of our business with the us government principally the department of defense “dod” as prime contractor principal subcontractor team member or partner we participate in many highpriority us defense technology programs with our product capabilities heavy industrial facilities and a workforce of approximately 38000 employees we believe we are positioned to continue to support the longterm objectives of the us navy to adapt and respond to a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment 

newport news 

the capabilities of our newport news operations extend from our core nuclear business of designing and constructing nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and the refueling and overhaul of such ships to our 

  

secondary businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operations management and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through department of energy “doe” cleanup programs our newport news shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the united states our facilities are located on approximately 550 acres on the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities that include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers a module outfitting facility and various other workshops our newport news shipyard also has a 2170foot dry dock and a 1050ton gantry crane capable of servicing two aircraft carriers at one time 

design construction and refueling and complex overhaul “rcoh” of aircraft carriers 

engineering design and construction of us navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to our operations aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the us navy’s fleet with a weight displacement of about 90000 tons since 1933 newport news has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the us navy including all 11 ships currently in active service 

the us navy’s newest carrier and the last of the cvn68 nimitz class cvn77 uss george hw bush  was delivered on may 11 2009 we have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier the cvn78 gerald r ford class for over nine years in 2008 we were awarded a 51 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class cvn78 gerald r ford  which is scheduled for delivery in 2015 we subsequently received awards in 2009 2010 and 2011 under a construction preparation contract totaling 11 billion for the second cvn78 gerald r ford class aircraft carrier the cvn79 john f kennedy  this fouryear contract includes design efforts planning procurement of longleadtime materials and limited fabrication as well as continued research and development efforts with key suppliers 

we continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear carrier rcohs each rcoh takes over three years to complete and accounts for approximately 35 of all maintenance and modernization in the service life of an aircraft carrier rcoh services include propulsion refueling of reactors propulsion plant modernization and propulsion plant repairs restoration of service life dry docking tank and void maintenance hull shafting propellers rudders piping repairs replacement and upgrades electrical systems upgrades aviation capabilities and modernization warfare interoperability and environmental compliance we provide ongoing maintenance services for the us navy aircraft carrier fleet through both rcoh and repair work we expect to redeliver cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt to the us navy following its rcoh in 2013 

in 2010 we were awarded a 678 million planning contract an initial award of 79 million with two oneyear options for the rcoh of the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln  in 2011 the us navy exercised the first option for 207 million we believe that our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers as well as the fact that this work requires a highly trained workforce is capitalintensive and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear requirements strongly positions us as the frontrunner for the award of future rcoh contracts on the current and future fleet of us navy carriers 

aircraft carrier inactivation 

aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years and we believe the 11 carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service as well as those we will deliver in the future present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation we anticipate that in 2013 the us navy will contract with us through our newport news shipyard to inactivate the cvn65 uss enterprise  the world’s first nuclearpowered aircraft carrier which was built by us and commissioned in 1961 we have constructed the facility to perform this work at our newport news shipyard additionally as other aircraft carriers in the naval fleet age we believe that the us navy will require inactivation of those ships and we plan to be positioned as the best choice for the us navy to award that work we expect each contract for an aircraft carrier inactivation to be valued at over 650 million 

design and construction of nuclearpowered submarines 

we are one of only two companies in the united states capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy since 1960 newport news has delivered 57 submarines to the us navy comprised of 43 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines of the 54 nuclearpowered fast attack submarines currently in active service 26 were delivered by newport news our nuclear submarine program located at our newport news shipyard includes construction engineering design research and integrated planning in february 1997 we executed a teaming agreement with electric boat a division of general dynamics to build ssn774 virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively under 

  

the present arrangement we build the stern habitability and machinery spaces torpedo room sail and bow while electric boat builds the engine room and control room work on the reactor plant and the final assembly test outfit and delivery of the submarine alternate between electric boat and us the four submarines of the first block and the first four submarines of the second block of ssn774 virginia class submarines have been delivered construction on the remaining two submarines of the second block is underway with the last submarine scheduled for delivery in 2013 in december 2008 the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight ssn774 virginia class submarines the multiyear contract increased construction from one per year to two submarines per year from 2011 to 2013 the fiscal year 2012 omnibus appropriations act included funding for two virginia class submarines per year the eighth submarine to be procured under this contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019 

ssbnx ohio class replacement program 

the us navy issued in february 2010 its report of the quadrennial defense review “qdr” a legislatively mandated review of military strategy and priorities for the next four years which included the force requirements on which the us navy relied to design its 30year plan now referred to as the 2012 shipbuilding plan the 2012 shipbuilding plan states the us navy’s intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging ohio class ballistic and cruise missile submarines the us navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the ssbnx ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines which were first introduced into service in 1981 although the contract is not yet negotiated we expect to participate in the design effort and our experience and wellqualified workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort the ssbnx ohio class includes 14 ballistic missile submarines “ssbn” and four cruise missile submarines “ssgn” the ssbnx ohio class submarine replacement program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15year period at a cost of approximately 4 billion to 7 billion each the first ohio class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2029 meaning that the first replacement submarine should be in service by that time the us navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to electric boat at this time construction is expected to begin in 2019 with the procurement of longleadtime materials in 2015 the current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may delay the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured but we believe the ssbnx ohio class submarine replacement program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future 

energy 

our doe and commercial nuclear programs leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations program management and heavy manufacturing we selectively partner with experienced industry leaders and we are a participant in one active joint venture we are also able through our subsidiary newport news industrial corporation “nni” to provide a range of services to the energy and petrochemical industries as well as government customers

summary segment financial data 

for a more complete understanding of our segment financial information see segment operating results in item 7 and note 6 segment information in item 8 

customers 

revenues from the us government accounted for substantially all of our total revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 in 2011 approximately 97 of our revenues were generated from the us navy and approximately 3 were generated from the us coast guard 

intellectual property 

with more than 5100 engineers and designers we develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in 

  

the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by our patents while our intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business we do not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

seasonality 

no material portion of our business is seasonal the timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors including the timing of contract awards the incurrence of contract costs cost estimation and unit deliveries see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments—revenue recognition in item 7 

backlog 

at december 31 2011 our total backlog was 163 billion compared with 173 billion at the end of 2010 approximately 33 of backlog at december 31 2011 is expected to be converted into sales in 2012 

total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded idiq orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made for backlog by segment see backlog in item 7 

raw materials 

the most significant raw material we use is steel other materials used in large quantities include paint aluminum pipe electrical cable and fittings all of these materials are currently available in adequate supply in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government generally for all of our longterm contracts we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source however due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry there are currently several components for which there is only one supplier we believe that these single source suppliers as well as our overall supplier base are adequate to meet our future needs we have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating longterm agreements with a number of raw material suppliers in addition we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain arrangements included in our customer contracts 

research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations our research and development activities primarily include independent research and development “ird” efforts related to government programs in accordance with us government regulations we recover a significant portion of our ird expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts we include ird expenses in general and administrative expenses companysponsored ird expenses totaled 24 million 23 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

at our virginia advanced shipbuilding and carrier integration center facility “vascic” located in newport news virginia we conduct onsite warfare systems testing training and laboratory research for the next generation aircraft carriers submarines and other ships vascic serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies it has a classified facility and an integration area that allows for research and development related to setup and testing of electronics as well as hull mechanical and electrical systems prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship it also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3d displays we believe vascic benefits the us navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities reducing total ownership cost and facilitating technology transfer 

  

governmental regulation and supervision 

our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of us government contracts see risks related to our business in item 1a 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the us navy’s supervisor of shipbuilding the defense contract audit agency “dcaa” and the defense contract management agency “dcma” these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems earned value management systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties as well as administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate as contracts subject to new contractor business systems rules are awarded withholdings may occur in the future if the us government makes a final determination of one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of such systems 

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not for the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities including but not limited to excess reprocurement costs and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

in 2009 congress passed legislation to improve the organization and procedures of the dod for the acquisition of major weapons systems including shipbuilding and maritime systems this legislation the weapon system acquisition reform act of 2009 requires the dod to develop mechanisms to address cost schedule and performance in establishing program requirements as acquisition reform progresses we will continue to anticipate and respond to the actions of the pentagon and congress to determine their impact on our operations 

government contractors must comply with a significant volume of procurement regulations and other requirements contracting with the us government may result in our filing of requests for equitable adjustments “reas” which represent requests for the us government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract including pricing delivery schedule technical requirements or other affected terms due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the us government is responsible reas are prepared submitted and negotiated in the ordinary course of business and large reas are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and overhaul activities such reas are not considered claims under the contract disputes act of 1978 although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations are unproductive 

in cases where there are multiple suppliers contracts for the construction and conversion of us navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding in evaluating proposed prices the us navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing estimated costs of completion and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism the us navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder under us government regulations certain costs including certain financing costs and marketing expenses are not allowable contract costs the us government also regulates the methods by which all costs including overhead are allocated to government contracts 

our contracts with various agencies of the us government and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to additional procurement regulations that include but are not limited to the truth in negotiations act the procurement integrity act the false claims act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act noncompliance found by any one agency may result in fines penalties debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 

  

competition 

we primarily compete with general dynamics and to a lesser extent with smaller shipyards one or more of whom may be teamed with a large defense contractor intense competition related to programs resources and funding and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general it is common in this industry to share work on major programs among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another party become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts the nature of major defense programs conducted under binding contracts allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 

we believe we are wellpositioned in the market because we are the only company currently capable of building refueling and defueling the us navy’s nuclearpowered aircraft carriers we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded any contracts to perform such activities even so the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities in this regard the fiscal year 2012 national defense authorization act “2012 act” requires dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2012 act however permits the secretary of defense to waive the requirement for dod to develop a refueling capability if fulfilling the requirement would not be economically feasible we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the us navy including lhas and lpds and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are also the sole supplier of national security cutters for the us coast guard and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels we are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy and one of only two companies that builds the us navy’s current fleet of ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyers we are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well 

our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop market and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the us navy’s budget as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 

environmental health and safety 

our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable that we will incur such costs in the future in amounts we can reasonably estimate to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities or at sites where we are named a potentially responsible party “prp” by the us environmental protection agency “epa” or similarly designated by another environmental agency these estimates may change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future caused by the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup determination of legally responsible parties and the status of laws regulations and their interpretations 

we assess the potential impact on our financial statements by estimating the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur on a sitebysite basis taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites we review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances we record accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated we record insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual 

we estimate that as of december 31 2011 the probable future costs for environmental remediation is approximately 3 million which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position we record environmental accruals on an undiscounted basis at sites involving multiple parties we provide environmental accruals based upon our expected share of liability taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate capitalized expenditures relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities we may have to incur costs exceeding those already estimated and accrued if other prps do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs which could have a material effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows we have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental 

  

laws although we cannot predict whether information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated accrued liability we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may incur environmental costs in the future related to the wind down of our construction activities at avondale due to insufficient information about the nature timing and extent of any potential environmental remediation and costs that we may incur these costs are not reasonably estimable at this time accordingly potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of our construction activities at avondale are not included in the estimated 3 million of probable future costs for environmental remediation in the 271 million estimate of avondale asset writedowns and restructuring related costs or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements based on the federal acquisition regulations “far” we expect that a significant portion of any potential future environmental costs we incur at avondale would be recoverable consistent with government accounting practices 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as “green initiatives” we expect to incur capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations at this time however we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to occupational health and safety the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with many hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments according to the bureau of labor statistics the shipbuilding and ship repair industry naics 336611 ranks among the highest in several injury metrics nevertheless in terms of serious injuries at our operations there have been five industrial related fatalities in the past seven years our internal audit program seeks to ensure that our occupational safety  health administration “osha” compliance programs remain strong in 1995 our newport news shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the star award from osha’s voluntary protection program “osha vpp” to earn this award we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the osha vpp in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work since then our gulfport mississippi and continental maritime of san diego california facilities have also been certified as osha vpp star sites additionally our avondale facility has been certified as an osha vpp merit site 

the nuclear regulatory commission the doe and the dod regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle subject to certain requirements and limitations our government contracts generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs resulting from our nuclear operations 

employees 

we have approximately 38000 employees we are the largest industrial employer in virginia and the largest private employer in mississippi our workforce contains many third fourth and fifthgeneration shipbuilding employees we employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades including more than 5100 engineers and designers and more than 1600 employees with advanced degrees employees who have been with us or our predecessor companies for over 40 years achieve the title of master shipbuilder as of december 31 2011 we had 975 master shipbuilders 676 in newport news and 299 at ingalls we employ nearly 5500 veterans 

our newport news apprentice school trains approximately 750 apprentices each year in 19 crafts and trades and several advanced programs our ingalls apprentice school currently has approximately 362 registered apprentices in its programs apprentices are paid as fulltime employees for the duration of their studies and usually continue to work with us upon graduation from nuclear pipe welders to senior executives approximately 2850 alumni of the apprentice school at newport news and approximately 1890 alumni of our ingalls apprentice school continue to work with us 

approximately 50 of our employees are covered by a total of 10 collective bargaining agreements we expect to renegotiate each of our collective bargaining agreements between 2013 and 2015 as they approach expiration we do not expect the results of these negotiations to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties we seek to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase our securities 

risks related to our business 

we depend heavily on a single customer the us government for substantially all of our business and changes affecting this customer’s ability to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business is primarily dependent upon the design construction repair maintenance fleet support and life cycle services of nuclearpowered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines and nonnuclear ships such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships for the us navy and coastal defense surface ships for the us coast guard as well as the overhaul and refueling of nuclearpowered ships for the us navy substantially all of our revenues during 2011 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the us government and we expect this to continue in the future in addition substantially all of our backlog was us government related as of december 31 2011 we are a supplier either directly or as a subcontractor or team member to the us government and its agencies the related contracts are subject to various risks including our customers’ political and budgetary constraints and processes changes in customers’ shortrange and longrange strategic plans the timing of contract awards significant changes in contract scheduling intense contract and funding competition difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work delays in the timing of contract approval and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the us government which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

contracts with the us government are subject to uncertain levels of funding modification due to changes in customer priorities and potential termination 

we are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense monies to the us navy and the us coast guard the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes for certain programs congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years consequently programs may be partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations we cannot predict the extent to which total funding andor funding for individual programs will be included increased or reduced as part of the fiscal year 2013 budget and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress or will be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations 

the impact severity and duration of the current us economic downturn and pressures on the federal budget could also adversely affect the total funding andor funding for individual programs the level of future appropriations for defense programs has become more uncertain following the debt ceiling crisis in august 2011 and the failure of a joint committee of congress to identify up to 15 trillion in deficit reductions in november 2011 as required under the budget control act of 2011 as a result of such failure up to 600 billion in automatic spending cuts to defense programs could be triggered under the budget control act beginning in 2013 or cuts could be effected through other congressional actions which could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs andor a lack of funding for future programs the budget control act provided for 487 billion of defense cuts over the next decade and the 600 billion of sequestration cuts would be added to that amount in the event that appropriations for any of our existing or future programs become unavailable or are reduced or delayed our contracts or subcontracts under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such programs and on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning andor the nature of war related activity on existing followon or replacement programs a shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate andor reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in addition the us government generally has the ability to terminate contracts in whole or in part with little to no prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance in the event of termination for the us government’s convenience contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit related to those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed however such a termination could result in the cancelation of future work on that program termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities including excess reprocurement costs and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts any termination can also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

contract cost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business 

our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers this cost growth can occur if estimates to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges manufacturing difficulties delays workforce related issues or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were inaccurate the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the timelines and availability of materials major subcontractor performance and quality of their products the effect of any delays in performance availability and timing of funding from the customer natural disasters and the inability to recover claims included in the estimates to complete a significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our us government customer depends on the type of contract under which we are performing our us government business is currently performed under firm fixed price “ffp” fixed price incentive “fpi” cost plus incentive fee “cpif” cost plus fixed fee “cpff” and cost plus award fee “cpaf” contracts under ffp contracts we retain all costs savings on completed contracts but are liable for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price fpi contracts on the other hand are flexibly priced arrangements under which overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the us government and us the us government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price typically 125–135 of target cost our profit varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost under cpif cpff and cpaf contracts we are generally only required to perform the contract to the extent the us government makes funds available and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract under cpif contracts our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage under cpff contracts the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred under cpaf contracts the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract in 2011 approximately 45 of newport news’ revenues were cpif which primarily included aircraft carrier construction and rcoh approximately 27 of newport news’ 2011 revenues were fpi contracts consisting primarily of submarine construction 26 of revenues were cpff contracts 1 were cpaf and 1 were ffp approximately 73 of ingalls’ revenues were fpi 13 were cpaf 9 were cpff 3 were cpif and 2 were ffp to the extent our mix of contract types change in the future our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected 

our earnings and margins depend in part on our ability to perform under contracts subcontractor performance and raw materials and component availability and pricing 

when agreeing to contract terms we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events many of which extend over long periods these projections assess the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries we may experience significant variances from our assumptions delays in our contract performance and variances in the timing of our product deliveries if actual events differ significantly from one or more of our assumptions projections or estimates or if we face unanticipated contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected 

we rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and subassemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers disruptions or performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our 

  

commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreedupon products or materials or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

all major materials parts and components for our products are currently available in adequate supply from domestic andor foreign sources through the cost escalation provisions contained in some of our us government contracts we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices even with these provisions however the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty a significant delay in deliveries of key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with our government contracts we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the us government due largely to the consolidation of the defense industry there are currently certain components for which there is only one supplier the inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts 

the prospects of us shipyards including ours can be materially affected by their success in securing significant us navy contract awards in february 2010 the dod issued its report of the quadrennial defense review “qdr” a legislatively mandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the us navy relied on the force requirements set forth in the qdr to design its 2012 shipbuilding plan which applied the goals and strategies set forth in the qdr to identify the naval capabilities projected to meet the defense challenges faced by the united states in the next three decades the 2012 shipbuilding plan uses as a baseline a 328ship force up from the former 313ship force that was first proposed by the us navy to congress in 2006 of the 328ship force the 2012 shipbuilding plan currently anticipates procurement of 275 ships during the next 30 years in response to the plan to cut 487 billion of defense spending over the next decade as provided in the budget control act of 2011 the dod released in january 2012 a revised comprehensive military strategy that seeks to address the reduced funding the us navy has indicated it will complete a new force structure assessment by the end of 2012 that will address the number of ships and other weapons the us navy believes it will need in light of the new national security strategy any significant reduction from the 2012 shipbuilding plan and a resulting reduction in the number of ships procured by the us navy would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe that our shipbuilding programs are a high priority for national defense but under budgetary pressures one or more of our programs may be reduced extended or terminated by our us government customers specific actions already taken that could negatively affect us include the deferral of production of new maritime prepositioning ships the reduction in the number of planned large surface combatants and an increase in the procurement interval for aircraft carriers to five years in response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of “smart weapons” it is possible that future strategy reassessments by the dod may result in a decreased need for aircraft carriers for the year ended december 31 2011 aircraft carrier construction and design engineering accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated revenue significant reductions in the level of congressional appropriations for our shipbuilding programs or significant delays of such appropriations would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the department of defense has announced plans for significant changes to its business practices that could have a material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards 

in november 2010 the dod announced certain initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors these initiatives are organized in five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy our understanding is that these initiatives are intended to drive down costs and enhance efficiencies and productivity as described by a senior dod official they are intended to enable the dod to do more without more 

these initiatives are expected to impact the contracting environment in which we do business with our dod customers as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the dod we are taking steps internally to assess how we can respond to and support these changes including how we can further 

  

reduce costs and increase productivity modify how we respond to proposals and revise our areas of focus depending on how these initiatives are implemented they could have an impact on current programs as well as new business opportunities 

our future success depends in part on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost requiring us to have and maintain technologies facilities equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers 

shipbuilding is a long cycle business and our success depends on quality cost and schedule performance on our contracts we must have and sustain the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost if we fail to maintain our competitive position we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain market share and our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of engineers and skilled workers at competitive costs with requisite skills andor security clearances at the same time stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce the necessary nuclear expertise required and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business if qualified personnel become scarce we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees or difficulty in performing under our contracts or pursuing new business if the needs for such employees are unmet 

competition within our markets and an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share 

we believe the programs and number of ship constructions refuelings and overhauls and inactivations currently planned by the us navy over the next several years will remain relatively steady however projected us defense spending levels for periods beyond the nearterm are uncertain and difficult to predict while the us navy’s current 2012 shipbuilding plan is based on an optimized 328ship force the plan itself anticipates procurement of only 275 ships during the 30year period moreover the 275 ship force is currently under reassessment and may be reduced reductions in us defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors we may experience declines in revenues and market share which would negatively impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclearpowered carriers we believe that two existing governmentowned shipyards one in the us pacific northwest and the other in the us midatlantic could refuel nuclearpowered carriers if substantial investments in facilities personnel and training were made us governmentowned shipyards are presently involved in refueling overhaul and inactivation of ssn688 los angeles class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling nonnuclear ships the 2012 act requires dod to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers the 2012 act however permits the secretary of defense to waive the requirement for dod to develop a refueling capability if fulfilling the requirement would not be economically feasible if the secretary does not grant a waiver and a governmentowned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the business of refueling nuclearpowered aircraft carriers our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also compete in the engineering planning and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on future us navy engineering work including aircraft carrier research and development submarine design and future surface combatant and amphibious assault programs 

the competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards as the competitive environment intensifies the number of bid protests may increase bid protests could result in an award decision being overturned requiring a rebid of the contract even when a bid protest does not result in a rebid the resolution typically extends the time until the contract activity can begin which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced 

overcapacity in the us shipbuilding market may reduce our market share or our ability to secure contract awards at profitable prices 

the reduced level of shipbuilding activity by the us navy evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 285 ships as of june 10 2011 has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation 

  

the general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards there are principally six major private us shipyards three of which are our shipyards plus numerous other smaller private shipyards that compete for contracts to construct overhaul repair or convert naval vessels we have announced our intention to cease all shipbuilding operations in our louisiana facilities and anticipate complete closure of these facilities by the end of 2013 competition for future programs is expected to be intense additionally our products such as aircraft carriers submarines and other ships compete with each other as well as with other defense products and services for defense monies we cannot guarantee that there will not be some future rationalization of shipyard capacity in the united states and that we will not be subject to shipyard consolidation or closures as a result of the reduced level of us navy spending on the construction of its naval fleet any further reduction could have a significant effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as a us government contractor we are subject to substantial regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

us government contractors must comply with a variety of significant regulations including procurement nuclear and other requirements these regulations and requirements although customary in government contracts increase our performance and compliance costs our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment which mandates increased performance and compliance efforts and costs if any such regulations or requirements change our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our margins 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its various agencies such as the us navy’s supervisor of shipbuilding the dcaa and the dcma these agencies review our performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review include but are not limited to our accounting systems purchasing systems billing systems property management and control systems cost estimating systems compensation systems and management information systems any costs we incur that are found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government we could also suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate as contracts subject to new contractor business systems rules are awarded withholdings may occur in the future if the us government makes a final determination of one or more significant deficiencies in one or more such systems 

as with other government contractors the us government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced or that costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed some of these recommendations involve substantial amounts in the past as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries we have on occasion made minor adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts we cannot guarantee that such audits investigations and inquiries will not result in reductions of our contract prices in the future 

we are also from time to time subject to us government investigations relating to our operations and we are subject to or are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws including but not limited to the truth in negotiations act the false claims act the procurement integrity act cost accounting standards the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act the close the contractor fraud loophole act and the foreign corrupt practices act if we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines compensatory or treble damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting given our dependence on government contracting suspension or debarment would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex require manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

we design develop and manufacture products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

firstinclass ships also known as lead ships usually have new technology that is supplied by the us navy other contractors or us problems in developing these new technologies or design changes later in the construction process can lead to delays in maintaining the design schedule needed for construction the risk associated with new technology or midconstruction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery for example the new cvn78 gerald r ford class has many new technologies with several of them still in development those technologies include but are not limited to the electromagnetic aircraft launch system “emals” the advanced arresting gear “aag” and the dual band radar “dbr” all three of these technologies are being developed concurrently with the ship under construction late delivery of information could drive inefficiencies in the construction process increase costs and put the delivery schedule at risk which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

in addition our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenues and profitability include premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement problems with quality or workmanship and unplanned degradation of product performance these failures could result either directly or indirectly in loss of life or property unforeseen problems that may negatively affect our revenues and profits by causing unanticipated costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

in the past we have experienced quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our us government customer these issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions we may discover additional quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action currently undiscovered quality issues that might arise in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits or may incur additional costs related to the wind down of our construction activities at our louisiana facilities and the consolidation of all ingalls construction into our mississippi facilities 

we have announced our intention to wind down our construction activities at avondale our louisiana shipyard in 2013 and two louisiana components facilities by 2013 after completing lpd23 and lpd25 the two lpd17 san antonio class ships currently under construction and consolidate all ingalls construction into our mississippi facilities we intend to shift future construction of lpd class ships to a single production line at our pascagoula mississippi facility to reduce costs and increase efficiency we cannot provide any assurances that consolidation of ingalls’ shipbuilding activities at our pascagoula and gulfport facilities will result in our realization of benefits from serial production at those facilities in connection with the increased utilization of our employees and facilities in our pascagoula shipyard we may encounter difficulties in adhering to backtoback production schedules an inability to adhere to production schedules could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely perform under our contracts and to obtain new contracts in the future furthermore because our ingalls workforce will be located primarily in pascagoula and gulfport we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled and trained employees to perform the increased workload in these two locations any failure to attract and retain the necessary workforce or to effectively manage and control thirdparty contractors could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we anticipate that we will incur substantial restructuring related costs and asset writedowns currently estimated at 271 million related to the wind down of our operations at avondale we believe that substantially all of the restructuring expenses associated with the wind down of those operations will be recoverable and amortized as future allowable costs over five years based upon applicable government regulations governing internal restructuring activities andor other far allowable contract cost provisions in a preliminary assessment of our proposed treatment of the wind down costs the 

  

us navy voiced concerns regarding the allowability of selected elements of our restructuring proposal the dcaa prepared an initial audit report on our cost recovery proposal which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the dcaa to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately 25 million or 8 of the costs included in the proposal we have submitted a revised proposal to address the concerns of the dcaa and to reflect an estimated total cost of 271 million we currently do not have an agreement with the us navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down at avondale we may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down these potential costs are not known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but they could be significant the actual restructuring expenses related to the wind down may be greater than our current estimate and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we use estimates when accounting for contracts changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for new programs we estimate negotiate and contract for construction on ships that are not completely designed as a result assessing risks estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work for all ships assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages and prices for materials similarly assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts incentives awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenues and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance 

because of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if the underlying circumstances change future changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and our financial performance see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters environmental disasters and other factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have significant operations located in regions of the united states that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms such as hurricanes and environmental disasters such as oil spills although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows see our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position  

our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract which could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor the customer or our insurers and could result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts 

natural disasters can also disrupt our workforce electrical and other power distribution networks including computer and internet operation and accessibility and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations these disruptions could cause adverse effects on our profitability and performance environmental disasters particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships can disrupt the timing of our performance under our contracts with the us navy and the us coast guard 

  

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position 

we endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities including among others natural disasters product liability and business interruption not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance and for insurable risks the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred including for example a catastrophic hurricane claim in some but not all circumstances we may receive indemnification from the us government because of the limitations in overall available insurance coverage we may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 

approximately 50 of our approximately 38000 employees are covered by a total of 10 collective bargaining agreements we expect to renegotiate renewals of each of our collective bargaining agreements between 2013 and 2015 as they approach expiration collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time while we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers it is possible that we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining agreements we have in the past experienced work stoppages strikes and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements if we experience such events in the future we could incur additional expenses and work stoppages or delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm return on assets actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings equity and contributions to our pension and retiree health care plans in future periods 

our pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various assumptions particularly with respect to the estimates of the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates variances from these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows differences between actual investment returns and our expected longterm return on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and funded status and could result in adverse changes in required funding to the plans timing differences exist among the accrual of pension costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” pension funding and the recovery of costs that are allowable under our government contracts such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations 

on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards “cas” board issued its final cas harmonization rule the “harmonization rule” the new rule will impact pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 although we believe that contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on cascovered contracts awarded prior to the february 27 2012 effective date the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment 

for a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes see critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 

unforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations including those imposed in response to climate change concerns or other actions commonly referred to as “green initiatives” we expect to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations 

the nature of shipbuilding operations requires the use of hazardous materials our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits in order to handle these materials 

  

our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past in addition the extensive handling of these materials sometimes results in spills in the shipyards and occasionally in the adjacent rivers and waterways where we operate the shipyards also have extensive waste handling programs that we maintain and periodically modify consistent with changes in applicable regulations see environmental health and safety in item 1 

various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance and certain environmental laws impose joint and several “strict liability” for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances rendering a person liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties 

environmental laws and regulations can also impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment in addition if we are found to be in violation of the clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the epa on the “excluded parties list” maintained by the general services administration facilities on the “excluded parties list” are prohibited from working on any us government contract the listing would continue until the epa concludes that the cause of the violation had been cured 

the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations imposition of new cleanup requirements discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we previously announced our intention to wind down our shipbuilding operations at our louisiana facilities located in avondale waggaman and tallulah which we anticipate will be completed in 2013 the winding down of operations at these facilities may result in environmental costs these potential costs are not known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but they could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

market volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access costeffective sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial instruments 

the financial and credit markets have experienced high levels of volatility and disruption reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers we expect to access these markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions and capital expansion projects obtaining credit support for our selfinsurance for workers’ compensation refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

a tightening of credit could also adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to obtain financing delays in suppliers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of financing could negatively affect their ability to perform under contracts with us and cause us to be unable to meet our contract obligations the inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers which could result in significant incremental costs and delays 

we have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional parties and may in the future enter into additional agreements with such parties these transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be realized upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 

  

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees agents or business partners 

we have implemented extensive compliance controls policies and procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate including laws governing payments to government officials security clearance breaches cost accounting and billing competition and data privacy however we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees agents or business partners any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted by security threats including cyber security threats and related disruptions 

as a defense contractor we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process transmit and store electronic information including classified and other sensitive information of the us government while we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure including threats to our and the us government’s proprietary or classified information we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified or other sensitive information located at our facilities in addition our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities as well as other disruptions could result in potential liability or the loss of contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our nuclear operations subject us to various environmental regulatory financial and other risks 

the development and operation of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers nuclearpowered submarines nuclear facilities and other nuclear operations subject us to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 failure to properly handle these materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage including environmental contamination if an accident were to occur its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel as well as other factors beyond our control such as weather and wind conditions actions taken in response to an accident could result in significant costs 

our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission in the event of noncompliance these agencies may increase regulatory oversight impose fines or shut down our operations depending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation subject to certain requirements and limitations our government contracts generally provide for indemnity by the us government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations we can give no assurance however that we will be indemnified for all liabilities that we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations 

in addition revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the us navy doe and nuclear regulatory commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures while we maintain insurance for certain risks related to transportation of low level nuclear materials and waste such as contaminated clothing and for regulatory changes in the health safety and fire protection areas there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our 

  

costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our nuclear operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

changes in future business conditions could cause business investments recorded goodwill andor purchased intangible assets to become impaired resulting in substantial losses and writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as part of our overall strategy we may from time to time acquire a noncontrolling or controlling interest in a business these investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition prices which prices must be allocated among acquired assets including goodwill based upon fair market values notwithstanding our due diligence processes and business integration efforts actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates 

as of december 31 2011 goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 14 and 9 respectively of our recorded total assets in the past we have evaluated goodwill amounts for impairment annually on november 30 or when evidence of potential impairment exists purchased intangibles are evaluated when evidence of potential impairment exists the impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment as a general matter a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangibles adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangible assets 

in light of the adverse equity market conditions that began in the second quarter of 2011 and the resultant decline in industry market multiples and our market capitalization we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2011 as a result we recorded a preliminary noncash charge totaling 300 million in the third quarter of 2011 which was subsequently reduced to 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 after our completion of an impairment analysis we also recorded a noncash charge totaling 2490 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the impairment of goodwill as with the 2011 impairment the 2008 impairment was primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in market multiples and market capitalization as of the impairment testing dates the charges reduced goodwill recorded in connection with northrop grumman’s 2001 acquisition of newport news shipbuilding inc and litton industries inc 

further declines in market multiples or our stock price or other factors such as significant adverse changes to our future contract awards and operating margins at ingalls could lead to future impairments if we are required in the future to recognize additional impairment to goodwill it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain in addition timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period furthermore changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations or their interpretation could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense profitability and cash flow 

as of december 31 2011 the estimated value of our uncertain tax positions was a potential liability of 9 million which includes accrued interest and penalties if our positions are sustained by the taxing authority in our favor the reversal of the liability would reduce our income tax provision and cost of sales and service revenues however we cannot guarantee that such positions will be sustained in our favor 

  

we conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances we may have limited control over joint venture projects and have returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute 

in any joint venture arrangement differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues and we can give no assurances that we and our joint venture partners will always reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis or at all we also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners and we typically share liability or have joint andor several liability with our joint venture partners under these joint venture arrangements these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint ventures 

operating through joint ventures in which we are the minority holder results in limited control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that we follow as a result internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture when entering into joint ventures in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners we may agree to risks and contributions of resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we could receive which could reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if the risks and resources we contributed were always proportionate to our returns 

accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues transaction related charges and partner performance 

we might in the future make strategic acquisitions and investments and these activities involve risks and uncertainties 

in pursuing our business strategies we expect to review evaluate and consider potential acquisitions and investments in evaluating such transactions we will have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities furthermore acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties including the difficulty in integrating newlyacquired businesses the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives the potential value impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses if we fail to manage acquisitions investments and other transactions successfully our financial results business and future prospects could be harmed 

we are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments andor future material charges against our operating income materially impairing our financial position 

the size type and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation we are and may become subject to various environmental claims and other litigation which if not resolved within established reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows any claims and litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future the following paragraphs describe pending claims and litigation that if determined adversely for amounts that exceed accrued reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the second quarter of 2007 the us coast guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the deepwater modernization program for eight converted 123foot patrol boats the “vessels” based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft alignment problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on the vessels we submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper the us coast guard advised icgs which was formed by us and lockheed martin to perform the deepwater modernization program that it was seeking 96 million from icgs as a result of the revocation of acceptance the majority of the costs associated with the conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels which were converted under contracts with us and one of our subcontractors in 2008 the us coast guard advised icgs that the us coast guard would support an investigation by the us department of justice of icgs and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its 96 million claim independently the department of justice conducted an investigation of icgs under a sealed false claims act complaint filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time in february 2009 the district court unsealed the complaint filed by michael j dekort a former lockheed martin employee against us icgs and lockheed martin corporation relating to the vessel conversion effort damages under the false claims act are subject to trebling following the resolution of certain claims between the relator and a codefendant the district court entered a final judgment 

  

in march 2011 dismissing the relator’s remaining claims the relator appealed the dismissal of the remaining claims to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the parties filed their respective briefs and are awaiting further proceedings with the fifth circuit 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in several hundred cases filed in numerous jurisdictions around the country wherein former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us some cases allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials through contact with our employees and third persons who were on our premises the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestos related conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named defendants in some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our potential liability and that of our former executive officers 

on january 31 2011 the us department of justice first informed northrop grumman and us of a false claims act complaint that we believe was filed under seal by one or more plaintiffs relators in mid2010 in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint that we received the “complaint” alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means northrop grumman and we obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million plus penalties attorneys’ fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

we have agreed to cooperate with the government investigation relating to the false claims act complaint until the case is unsealed we will not know the department of justice’s decision on intervention based upon our review to date of the information available to us we believe we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint we believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts 

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could affect our ability to compete

our debt exposes us to certain risks 

as of december 31 2011 we had 1859 million of debt and an additional 650 million available for borrowings and letters of credit under the hii credit facility “credit facility” despite our current level of debt we may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future our current level of debt could have important consequences including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face would be increased 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt 

our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and our ability to borrow under our credit facilities to the extent of available borrowings this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we could experience decreased revenues from our operations and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our debt we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before the maturity thereof we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot service our debt we may have to take actions such as selling assets selling equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances we cannot assure you that any such actions if necessary could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes and our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our credit facility limit our ability among other things to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our credit facility limits our ability to make capital expenditures and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio these covenants may restrict our financial flexibility limit any strategic initiatives restrict our ability to grow or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes as a result of these covenants we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these covenants may limit our ability to successfully execute our strategy and operate our business 

risks related to the spinoff 

we may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of northrop grumman 

as a former subsidiary of northrop grumman we took advantage of northrop grumman’s size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits and technology such as computer software 

  

licenses we also relied upon northrop grumman to provide various corporate functions as a separate independent entity we may be unable to obtain these goods services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the spinoff we may also incur costs for functions previously performed by northrop grumman that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements which could cause our profitability to decrease 

we may be responsible for us federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spinoff from northrop grumman 

our spinoff from northrop grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that northrop grumman northrop grumman’s stockholders and we would be required to recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except with respect to cash received by northrop grumman’s stockholders in lieu of fractional shares 

if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction northrop grumman would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under irs regulations each member of northrop grumman’s consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including our subsidiaries and us would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes the distribution will be taxable to northrop grumman pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either northrop grumman or us representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption the tax liability resulting from the application of section 355e would be substantial and under irs regulations each member of the northrop grumman consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including our subsidiaries and us would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

we agreed with northrop grumman as part of the spinoff not to enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to northrop grumman including under section 355e we also agreed to indemnify northrop grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions the amount of any such indemnification could be substantial in addition these obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

we do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical financial information prior to april 1 2011 that we have included in this form 10k was derived from northrop grumman’s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone entity during the periods prior to april 1 2011 northrop grumman did not account for us and we were not operated as a single standalone entity for the quarter ended march 31 2011 and the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 in addition the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations financial position and cash flows will be in the future for example following the spinoff changes occurred in our cost structure funding and operations including changes in our tax structure increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with becoming a public standalone company while we were profitable as part of northrop grumman we cannot guarantee that as a standalone company our profits will continue at a similar level 

our customers and prospective customers must consider whether our responsibility on a standalone basis satisfies their requirements for engaging in business with us 

under far the government commonly makes affirmative responsibility determinations before entering into new contracts with a contractor in so doing the government considers various factors including financial resources performance record technical skills and facilities of a prospective contractor our customers and prospective customers will consider whether our responsibility on a standalone basis satisfies their requirements for entering into new contracts with us the us navy made its determination of contractor responsibility with respect to significant shipbuilding contracts that we have entered into since the 

  

spinoff and has found us to be a responsible contractor for those contracts we believe we are and will continue to be a responsible contractor under far nonetheless if in the future our customers or prospective customers are not satisfied with our responsibility including our financial resources it would likely affect our ability to bid for obtain or retain contracts which if unresolved could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

more generally our customers will need to develop and retain confidence in us as a partner on a standalone basis we believe that will occur in the process however our customers may continue to request additional information as well as undertake further audits or take other steps that could lead to delays and increased costs 

our spinoff from northrop grumman may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws 

a court could determine that northrop grumman did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the spinoff or that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness including the new debt incurred by us in connection with the spinoff transferring assets or taking other action as part of the spinoff and at the time of such action we or northrop grumman i was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent ii had reasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or iii intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature in such event the court could void the spinoff as a constructive fraudulent transfer if such court made this determination the court could impose a number of different remedies including voiding our liens and claims against northrop grumman or providing northrop grumman with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by northrop grumman and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff northrop grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that it owns and operates following the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to northrop grumman for example certain tax andor environmental liabilities particularly if northrop grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations 

risks related to our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness could limit our future ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently intend to pay a dividend on our common stock going forward our dividend policy will be established by our board of directors based upon our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt or debt that we may incur in the future may limit or prohibit the payments of dividends in addition the amount of our existing and any additional future debt may limit our ability to pay dividends if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends even if declared by our board of directors will be impaired there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence the payment of dividends 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law as well as regulatory requirements could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable for example the restated certificate of incorporation and the restated bylaws provide for a classified board require advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations place limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delays or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

  

we agreed with northrop grumman in connection with our spinoff not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition including issuance of our common stock or any other transaction or to the extent we have the right to prohibit it to permit any such transaction that could reasonably be expected to cause the spinoff to be taxable to northrop grumman we also agreed to indemnify northrop grumman for any tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions generally northrop grumman will recognize taxable gain on the spinoff if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of our capital stock directly or indirectly representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of our thenoutstanding capital stock and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any such shares of our common stock acquired directly or indirectly within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption the amount of any indemnification payment we may be required to pay to northrop grumman resulting from any such transactions could be substantial 

our activities especially our nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the us navy as such the us navy engaged us regarding the incorporation into our contracts of explicit terms regarding notice and approval rights in the event of a change of control of the company and regarding the us navy’s obligations to indemnify us for nuclear work one such clause as it applies to our nuclear work was negotiated and agreed to by the us navy and us last year and incorporated certain change of control and indemnification provisions into our existing contracts in order for the us navy to ensure that a potential buyer of the company would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner we are required to provide the us navy with notice of any potential change of control and obtain the us navy’s consent for transferring certain licenses this clause and other provisions have also been included in solicitations for future us navy nuclear work 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our obligations to northrop grumman in connection with the spinoff and the us navy under existing contracts may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders

there were no unresolved staff comments 




 item 2 properties 

at december 31 2011 we had operations in san diego california avondale new orleans louisiana gulfport and pascagoula mississippi and hampton newport news and suffolk virginia we also lease andor own office buildings related to our operations in both virginia beach virginia and washington dc 

newport news —our facilities in newport news virginia are located on approximately 550 acres that we own near the mouth of the james river which adjoins the chesapeake bay the premier deepwater harbor on the east coast of the united states our newport news shipyard is one of the largest in the united states it is the nation’s sole designer builder and refueler of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and one of only two companies capable of designing and building nuclearpowered submarines for the us navy the shipyard also provides services for naval and commercial vessels its facilities include seven graving docks a floating dry dock two outfitting berths five outfitting piers a module outfitting facility and various other shops 

our newport news shipyard also has a variety of other facilities including an 18acre allweather steel fabrication shop accessible by both rail and transporter a module outfitting facility that enables us to assemble a ship’s basic structural modules indoors and on land machine shops totaling 300000 square feet and its own school which provides a fouryear accredited apprenticeship program that trains shipbuilders 

ingalls —our four properties comprising our ingalls operations are located in pascagoula and gulfport mississippi and avondale and waggaman louisiana in addition our facilities in san diego california and virginia beach virginia are considered part of our ingalls operations during 2011 we closed and terminated the lease on a components facility in tallulah louisiana and ceased significant operations at a facility in waggaman louisiana 

our pascagoula shipyard is a primary provider of major surface warships to the us navy and has modernized dozens of other naval ships it is the only us shipyard in recent years to be developing and building six different classes of ships for 

  

the us navy and us coast guard our facilities in pascagoula are located on approximately 800 acres on the banks of the pascagoula river where it flows into the mississippi sound we lease the west bank of our pascagoula facility from the state of mississippi pursuant to a 99year lease consisting of a 40year base term plus six additional option terms we anticipate continued use of this facility for the remaining currently anticipated 55 years on the lease and beyond 

our components facility in gulfport mississippi sits on approximately 120 acres and focuses on composite research and engineering the facility is currently building the ddg1000 composite deckhouses we believe that this composite capability coupled with strong alliances with several universities and suppliers positions us to take advantage of any shift toward lighterweight topside composite structures in us naval and us coast guard applications 

our avondale shipyard is located on approximately 268 acres on the banks of the mississippi river approximately 12 miles upriver from downtown new orleans approximately 20 of the avondale shipyard is leased from several third parties the leases have varying expiration dates and typically contain renewal rights the avondale shipyard site has the capacity to manufacture large amphibious assault and military and commercial transport vessels and includes three outfitting docks totaling more than 6000 linear feet in addition to the shipyard operations include the maritime technology center of excellence we intend to wind down our construction activities at avondale in 2013 and consolidate all ingalls construction into our mississippi facilities 

our san diego california and virginia beach virginia facilities provide fleet support services 

we believe that substantially all of our plants and equipment are in general well maintained and in good operating condition they are considered adequate for present needs and as supplemented by planned construction are expected to remain adequate for the near future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

us government investigations and claims —departments and agencies of the us government have the authority to investigate various transactions and operations of our company and the results of such investigations may lead to administrative civil or criminal proceedings the ultimate outcome of which could be fines penalties repayments or compensatory or treble damages us government regulations provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracts or the loss of export privileges for a company or a division or subdivision suspension or debarment could have a material effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts 

in the second quarter of 2007 the us coast guard issued a revocation of acceptance under the deepwater modernization program for eight converted 123foot patrol boats the “vessels” based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft alignment problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside equipment” on the vessels we submitted a written response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was improper the us coast guard advised icgs which was formed by us and lockheed martin to perform the deepwater modernization program that it was seeking 96 million from icgs as a result of the revocation of acceptance the majority of the costs associated with the conversion effort are associated with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels which were converted under contracts with us and one of our subcontractors in 2008 the us coast guard advised icgs that the us coast guard would support an investigation by the us department of justice of icgs and its subcontractors instead of pursuing its 96 million claim independently the department of justice conducted an investigation of icgs under a sealed false claims act complaint filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas and decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time in february 2009 the district court unsealed the complaint filed by michael j dekort a former lockheed martin employee against us icgs and lockheed martin corporation relating to the vessel conversion effort damages under the false claims act are subject to trebling following the resolution of certain claims between the relator and a codefendant the district court entered a final judgment in march 2011 dismissing the relator’s remaining claims the relator appealed the dismissal of the remaining claims to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the parties filed their respective briefs and are awaiting further proceedings with the fifth circuit we do not believe that this litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows but we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

litigation— we are party to various investigations lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business although we believe that the resolution of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or 

  

litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters 

through northrop grumman we are pursuing legal action against an insurance provider fm global arising out of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related to hurricane katrina the case was commenced against fm global on november 4 2005 and is now pending in the us district court for the central district of california western division in an interlocutory appeal the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the fm global excess policy unambiguously excludes damage from the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina under its “flood” exclusion and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the california efficient proximate cause doctrine afforded coverage under the policy even if the flood exclusion of the policy is unambiguous in august 2010 the district court granted fm global’s motion for summary judgment based upon california’s doctrine of efficient proximate cause and denied fm global’s motion for summary judgment based upon breach of contract finding that triable issues of fact remained as to whether and to what extent we sustained wind damage apart from the hurricane storm surge in september 2011 the district court granted fm global’s motion for summary judgment to dismiss northrop grumman’s claims for bad faith damages and for contract reformation we intend to continue to pursue the breach of contract action against fm global in addition in january 2011 northrop grumman as our predecessorininterest filed suit against aon which acted as our broker in connection with the policy with fm global in superior court in california seeking damages for breach of contract professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation as well as for declaratory relief no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these matters if however either of these claims is successful the potential impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows would be favorable 

we received notification in 2008 from munichamerican risk partners “munich re” the only remaining insurer within the primary layer of insurance coverage for hurricane katrina damages with which a resolution had not been reached that it would pursue arbitration proceedings against us related to 1875 million owed to us by munich re for certain losses related to hurricane katrina an arbitration was later invoked by munich re in the united kingdom under a reinsurance contract we were also notified that munich re was seeking reimbursement of approximately 44 million of funds previously advanced to us for payment of claim losses for which munich re provided reinsurance protection pursuant to a reinsurance contract and 6 million of adjustment expenses on november 11 2011 we reached an agreement with munich re pursuant to which munich re agreed to withdraw and renounce with prejudice its reimbursement claim and pay us the remaining 1875 million of the limit under its reinsurance policy and to resolve and close the arbitration process 

on january 31 2011 the us department of justice first informed us through northrop grumman of a false claims act complaint that we believe was filed under seal by one or more plaintiffs relators in mid2010 in the us district court for the district of columbia the redacted copy of the complaint that we received the “complaint” alleges that through largely unspecified fraudulent means northrop grumman and we obtained federal funds that were restricted by law for the consequences of hurricane katrina and used those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts that were unrelated to hurricane katrina and for which northrop grumman and we were not entitled to recovery under the contracts the complaint seeks monetary damages of at least 835 million plus penalties attorney’s fees and other costs of suit damages under the false claims act may be trebled upon a finding of liability 

we have agreed to cooperate with the government investigation relating to the false claims act complaint until the case is unsealed we will not know the department of justice’s decision on intervention based upon our review to date of the information available to us we believe we have substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint we believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint evidence a fundamental lack of understanding of the terms and conditions in our shipbuilding contracts including the postkatrina modifications to those contracts and the manner in which the parties performed in connection with the contracts based upon our review to date of the information available to us we believe that the claims as set forth in the complaint lack merit and will not result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position we intend to vigorously defend the matter but we cannot predict what new or revised claims might be asserted or what information might come to light so can give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome 

we and our predecessorsininterest are defendants in several hundred cases filed in numerous jurisdictions around the country wherein former and current employees and various third parties allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials on or associated with our premises or while working on vessels constructed or repaired by us some cases allege exposure to asbestoscontaining materials through contact with our employees and third persons who were on our premises the cases allege various injuries including those associated with pleural plaque disease asbestosis cancer mesothelioma and other alleged asbestos related conditions in some cases several of our former executive officers are also named defendants in 

  

some instances partial or full insurance coverage is available to us for our liability and that of our former executive officers although we believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot predict what new or revised claims or litigation might be asserted or what information might come to light and can therefore give no assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related litigation

for convenience a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10k is included in the glossary of programs 

defense industry overview 

the united states faces a complex uncertain and rapidly changing national security environment the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats terrorist acts regional conflicts and cyber attacks responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion deterrence active defense security and stability operations or peacekeeping we believe that the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 

the united states’ engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven dod funding levels since 2001 in february 2010 the dod released its qdr a legislativelymandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years the qdr emphasized four key strategic priorities prevailing in today’s wars preventing and deterring conflict preparing to defeat adversaries in a wide range of contingencies and preserving and enhancing the allvolunteer force these priorities combined with supporting key joint mission requirements helped shape the us navy’s 2012 shipbuilding plan 

even with withdrawal from iraq we expect that the nation’s engagement in a multifront multidecade struggle will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges 

  

the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities while facing potential major budget cuts as early as 2013 through 2015 the base defense budget is expected to decline unless congress and the president can reach agreement on an alternative spending plan 

the us navy’s 2012 shipbuilding plan applies the goals and strategies set forth in the qdr to identify the naval capabilities projected to meet the defense challenges faced by the united states in the next three decades the 2012 shipbuilding plan uses as a baseline a 328ship force up from the former 313ship force that was first proposed by the us navy to congress in 2006 to design a battle inventory to provide global reach persistent presence and strategic operational and tactical effects expected of naval forces within reasonable levels of funding major elements of the 2012 shipbuilding plan include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the qdr has directed certain specific enhancements to us forces and capabilities and a number of these enhancements present us with substantial new competitive opportunities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in response to the plan to cut 487 billion of defense spending over the next decade as provided in the budget control act of 2011 the dod released in january 2012 a revised comprehensive military strategy that seeks to address the reduced funding the us navy has indicated it will complete a new force structure assessment by the end of 2012 that will address the number of ships and other weapons the us navy believes it will need in light of the new national security strategy in addition the failure of a joint committee of congress to identify 15 trillion in deficit reductions in november 2011 as required under the budget control act may result in an additional 600 billion in automatic spending cuts to defense programs 

the shipbuilding defense industry as characterized by its competitors customers suppliers potential entrants and substitutes is unique in many ways it is highly capital and skilled labor intensive the us navy a large single customer with many needs and requirements dominates the industry’s customer base and is served by a supplier base where competition is giving way to exclusive providers smaller shipyards however have entered the market to build the 

  

us navy’s new lcs the us navy must compete with other national priorities including other defense activities and entitlement programs for a share of federal budget funding 

the dod announced various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies refocus priorities and enhance business practices used by the dod including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors the most recent initiatives are organized in five major areas affordability and cost growth productivity and innovation competition services acquisition and processes and bureaucracy these initiatives are relatively new and the specific impacts on our industry will be understood better as the dod implements them further see risks related to our business in item 1a 

contracts 

we generate the majority of our business from longterm government contracts for design production and support activities government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material labor and subcontracting costs and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative expenses unless otherwise specified in a contract costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include but are not limited to certain legal costs lobbying costs charitable donations interest expense and advertising costs 

we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations in addition the dcaa routinely audits costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government 

our longterm contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories 

flexibly priced contracts —includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached approximately 99 of our 2011 revenues were generated from flexibly priced contracts including certain fixed price incentive contracts that have exceeded their cost share limit 

firm fixed price contracts —a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor time and materials contracts are considered firm fixed price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged approximately 1 of our 2011 revenues were generated from firm fixed price arrangements substantially all of our revenues for 2011 were derived from the us government 

contract fees —negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly priced and firm fixed price contracts include but are not limited to fixed fee amounts cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for under or over cost target performance respectively positive award fees and negative penalty arrangements profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements percentageofcompletion of the contract the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined 

award fees —certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality and technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 

critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition 

  

and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these areas it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 

  

  

  

  

 revenue recognition 

overview —we derive the majority of our business from longterm contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for constructiontype and productiontype contracts and federal government contractors we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

percentageofcompletion accounting —we generally recognize revenues from our longterm contracts under the costtocost measure of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the percentageofcompletion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses for most contracts we calculate sales based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract “eac” for certain contracts with large upfront purchases of material sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 

the use of the percentageofcompletion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design manufacture and delivery of our products and services such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment we record sales under costtype contracts as costs are incurred 

many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

at the start of each contract we estimate an initial profitbooking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility schedule and contract costs management performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters schedule and contract costs during the life of a contract the profitbooking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters schedule and contract costs conversely if we are not able to retire these risks our eac may increase resulting in a lower profitbooking rate 

changes in estimates of contract sales costs and profits are recognized using the cumulative catchup method of accounting this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods hence the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 net favorable unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments increased decreased operating income by 54 million 79 million and 81 million respectively in 2011 the net 

  

favorable cumulative catchup adjustment was primarily driven by the impact of performance improvements on the construction of ssn774 virginia class submarines partially offset by unfavorable performance adjustments on the lpd program in 2010 and 2009 the net unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustments were primarily driven by unfavorable performance adjustments on the lpd program partially offset by the impact of performance improvements on other programs 

cost estimation —the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program managers and financial professionals factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability productivity and cost of labor the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the effect of change orders the availability of materials the effect of any delays in performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and where such changes occur separate disclosure is made of the nature underlying conditions and financial impact from the change we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 

we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities 

other considerations —defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan “retirement related benefit plans” benefit costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon cas the cas requirements for retirement related benefit plans costs differ from the financial accounting standards “fas” requirements given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the cas and fas requirements to determine specific recoverability we have not estimated the incremental fas income or expense recoverable under our expected future contract activity and therefore did not defer any fas expense for retirement related benefit plans this resulted in a fas expense in excess of cas expense of 13 million 49 million and 88 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

purchase accounting and goodwill 

overview —goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amount of our goodwill at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 844 million and 1134 million respectively 

tests for impairment —we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists when testing goodwill we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about projected revenues operating expenses working capital investment capital expenditures and cash flows over a multiyear period the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against our market capitalization changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

november 30 2011 impairment test —we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2011 our testing as of november 30 2011 determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying value and accordingly no further impairment charge was necessary beyond the 290 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year for our ingalls segment as a result of our interim testing as of september 30 2011 the estimated fair value of the reporting unit within the newport news segment was significantly in excess of its corresponding 

  

carrying value as of november 30 2011 fair value estimates of the reporting units within the ingalls segment exceeded their corresponding carrying values by more than 10 as of november 30 2011 

september 30 2011 impairment test —in light of the adverse equity market conditions that began in the second quarter of 2011 and the resultant decline in industry market multiples and our market capitalization we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2011 the analysis resulted in a 290 million noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in our ingalls segment in 2011 due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill of each reporting unit we initially recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of 300 million during the third quarter of 2011 which represented our best estimate of the impairment amount at the time of the filing of our third quarter report the goodwill impairment charge was later adjusted to 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on the final impairment analysis the goodwill at these businesses has no tax basis and accordingly there was no tax benefit associated with recording the impairment charge no goodwill impairment was recognized at the newport news segment as its estimated fair value was significantly in excess of its carrying value as of september 30 2011 see note 10 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

november 30 2010 and june 30 2010 impairment test —as a result of the announcement to wind down operations at our avondale louisiana facility and the ingalls segment’s recent operating losses we performed an impairment test for each reportable segment’s goodwill the results of our goodwill impairment tests as of november 30 2010 and june 30 2010 indicated that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 

litigation commitments and contingencies 

overview —we are subject to a range of claims lawsuits environmental and income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies we record amounts as charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers and determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

environmental accruals —we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another we record the minimum amount of the range 

factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability range of estimated costs and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties financial insolvency of other responsible parties changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements and improvements in remediation technology although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asset retirement obligations —we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations recorded amounts as of december 31 2011 and 2010 are 25 million and 20 million respectively and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of operations at our avondale facility see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 

we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future that are not reasonably estimable as of december 31 2011 due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements environmental remediation andor asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these 

  

facilities in addition there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered for example asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business operations may exist in certain buildings and therefore these obligations have not been included in our consolidated financial statements 

litigation accruals —litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter including any settlement offers has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known based upon the information available we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain tax positions —uncertain tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the merits of the position are recognized in the financial statements we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return penalties if probable and reasonably estimable are recognized as a component of income tax expense we also recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes see note 12 income taxes in item 8 under existing gaap changes in accruals associated with uncertainties are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 

retirement related plans 

we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and fas the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment cas prescribes the allocation to and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on us government contracts through the pricing of products and services and the methodology to determine such costs fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income as well as the liability for financial reporting purposes the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas as a result while both cas and fas use longterm assumptions in their calculation methodologies each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs in addition the cash funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under erisa which is primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities effective january 1 2011 we were subject to the funding requirements under the ppa which amended erisa under the ppa we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year 

we record cas retirement related benefits expense in the results of our business segments and we include the fas expense for these benefits in total operating income under gaap due to the differences between fas and cas amounts we also present the difference between fas and cas expense referred to as our fascas adjustment to reconcile segment operating income to total operating income on a consolidated basis under gaap due to the foregoing differences in requirements and calculation methodologies our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or of the amounts we recover from the us government under cas 

when ppa was enacted it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors’ recovery of those costs under cas to remedy this cash flow problem on december 27 2011 the us cost accounting standards “cas” board issued its final cas harmonization rule the “harmonization rule” the harmonization rule is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa the harmonization rule is effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27 2012 under the harmonization rule only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27 2012 will reflect the effects of the rule the harmonization rule will impact pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 we expect that it will result in increased pension costs allocable to our contracts 

assumption s—our retirement related benefit plans are accounted for on the accrual basis the measurements of obligations and cost require significant judgment the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

  

discount rate —the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan’s benefit obligations the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics including current age and assumed mortality we use only bonds that are denominated in us dollars rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have a minimum outstanding issue of 50 million as of the measurement date and are not callable convertible or index linked since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point 

taking into consideration the factors noted above our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 523 and 584 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 494 and 558 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

expected longterm rate of return —the expected longterm rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense and is based on such factors as historical returns targeted asset allocations investment policy duration expected future longterm performance of individual asset classes inflation trends portfolio volatility and risk management strategies while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views in order to reflect expected lower future market returns we have reduced the expected longterm rate of return assumption from 850 used to record 2011 expense to 800 for 2012 the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 

an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions 

 

 differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income this unrecognized amount is amortized to the extent it exceeds 10 of the greater of the plan’s benefit obligation or plan assets the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants which is approximately 10 years 

cas expense— in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption unlike fas cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption which changes infrequently given its longterm nature as a result changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas in addition unlike under fas we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements 

other fas and cas considerations —we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as calendar year actual plan asset returns final census data from the end of the prior year and other actual and projected experience 

a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense and consequently the fascas adjustment is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements under fas our net gains and losses exceeding the 10 corridor are amortized 

  

over the employee’s average future service life of approximately 10 years under cas net gains and losses are amortized over a 15year period without regard to a corridor approach under the harmonization rule the amortization period will change to 10 years under cas a “marketrelated value” of our plan assets is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized the marketrelated value of assets is determined by spreading actual asset gains or losses over five years subject to certain limitations for fas we do not use this spreading method and instead use fair value in determining our fas costs accordingly fas expense generally reflects the recent gains and losses faster than cas another driver of fascas expense difference is the funded status of our pension plans under cas as noted above cas expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded for erisa purposes if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience our cas expense will change accordingly 

the favorable change in the fascas adjustment of 36 million in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by a decrease in our fas expense due primarily to favorable asset returns in 2010 coupled with offsetting higher cas costs primarily due to demographics 

retirement plan assets— retirement plan assets are stated at fair value investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists investments in fixedincome securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders investments in hedge funds and private equity and real estate investments are generally valued at their net asset values “nav” or equivalent 

management reviews independently appraised values audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav for the very limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value 

accumulated other comprehensive income— we recorded unrecognized losses of 1344 million and 797 million pretax related to our retirement related plans in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these net deferred losses resulted from differences between estimated and expected asset returns changes in the discount rate and changes in demographic experience the 547 million increase of unrecognized losses in 2011 was driven primarily by the decrease in the discount rates for 394 million and actual pension plan asset returns being less than expected for 84 million these and other net increases were partly offset by the amortization of previously accumulated net losses 

we recorded net unrecognized prior service costs and credits of 58 million and 61 million pretax related to our retirement related plans in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these deferred prior service costs and credits resulted from plan amendments in prior years including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs and credits resulted from amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs and credits and the avondale wind down 

the amortization period for qualifying unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized gainslosses is the estimated remaining service lives of our employees which is approximately 10 years 

workers’ compensation 

our operations are subject to federal and state workers’ compensation laws we maintain selfinsured workers’ compensation plans in addition to participating in federally administered second injury workers’ compensation funds we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions which include but are not limited to our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors as compiled in an annual actuarial study related selfinsurance accruals include amounts related to the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported our workers’ compensation liability was discounted at 305 and 331 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively based on future payment streams and a riskfree rate the workers’ compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was 739 million and 726 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

accounting standards updates 

see note 3 accounting standards updates in item 8 for a description of new accounting pronouncements and updates thereto 

  

operating performance assessment and reporting 

we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below with consideration given to the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments described within this section our portfolio of longterm contracts is largely flexibly priced which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance under far rules that govern our business most types of costs are allowable and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses as much as we do on total contract costs which are a key factor in determining contract operating income as a result in evaluating our operating performance we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues and operating income including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catchup method of accounting in accordance with gaap unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 

consolidated operating results 

selected financial highlights are presented in the table below 

 

 sales and service revenues 

sales and service revenues consist of the following 

 

 2011 —product sales and service revenues in 2011 decreased 148 million or 2 from 2010 the decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues in surface combatants aircraft carriers and fleet support these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in amphibious assault ships programs submarines and the nsc program see key segment financial measures below 

2010 —product sales and service revenues in 2010 increased 431 million or 7 from 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in the lpd and lha expeditionary warfare programs the cvn78 gerald r ford aircraft carrier construction program the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh and the ssn774 virginia class submarine construction program these increases were partially offset by reduced sales in 2010 following the 2009 deliveries of lhd8 uss makin island and cvn77 uss george hw bush  as well as the completion of the cvn65 uss enterprise extended drydocking selected restricted availability “edsra” in the second quarter of 2010 additionally during the second quarter of 2010 we announced our intent to wind down our shipbuilding operations at the avondale facility in 2013 see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 and reduced product revenues by 115 million to reflect revised estimates to complete lpd23 and lpd25 in 2009 we reduced product revenues by 160 million to reflect revised estimates to complete lpdclass ships and lha6 america

2011 —cost of product sales in 2011 decreased by 248 million or 5 as compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily driven by the lower sales volume in 2011 described above and a pretax charge of 113 million recognized in 2010 resulting from our decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility in 2013 see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the nonrecurring 113 million pretax charge recognized in 2010 in our ingalls segment for the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility cost of service revenues decreased 13 million or 2 from 2010 primarily as a result of the lower sales volume described above the modest increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is the result of normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

2010 —cost of product sales increased 627 million or 14 from 2009 primarily as a result of the higher sales volume previously described cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales declined slightly year over year principally as a result of lower unfavorable margin adjustments in our ingalls segment in 2010 relative to 2009 cost of service revenues decreased 257 million or 25 from 2009 primarily as a result of the lower sales volume described above the modest increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is the result of normal yeartoyear variances in contract mix 

general and administrative expenses 

in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 

2011 —general and administrative expenses in 2011 decreased 39 million or 6 from 2010 the decrease was due principally to a lower fascas adjustment see fascas adjustment below 

2010 —general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased to 663 million from 639 million in 2009 primarily as a result of higher cost allocations for northrop grumman management and support services the northrop grumman management and support services expense in 2010 increased to 115 million from 82 million in 2009 the increase in management and support services allocations reflects higher employee compensation expenses in 2010 and the impact of the final allocation of prior year overheads as a percentage of total sales and service revenues these costs decreased year over year due principally to the higher sales volume in 2010 

goodwill impairment 

as previously discussed in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments in item 7 we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year or when evidence of potential impairment exists we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred 

  

2011 —we recorded a net goodwill impairment charge in 2011 of 290 million in our ingalls segment see note 10 goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8 

2010 and 2009 —we did not record any goodwill impairment during the years 2010 and 2009 

operating income loss 

we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and as is typical in the industry we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating income” segment operating income is defined as operating income before the fascas adjustment and deferred state income taxes neither of which affects segment performance segment operating income is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating income is not however a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

the table below reconciles segment operating income loss to total operating income loss 

 

 segment operating income loss 

2011 —segment operating income was 122 million as compared to 294 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily the result of the 2011 goodwill impairment charge described above partially offset by the 113 million pretax charge recognized in 2010 resulting from our decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility 

2010 —segment operating income was 294 million an increase of 10 million from 2009 segment operating income was 43 and 45 of sales and service revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2010 we recorded net performance adjustments of 132 million on the lpd22 through lpd25 contract including the effect of a 113 million charge for the cumulative effect of the 210 million of incremental costs expected in connection with our decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility in 2013 see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 results for 2010 also include an unfavorable adjustment of 30 million to reflect additional costs to complete postdelivery work on lhd8 uss makin island results for 2009 included unfavorable performance adjustments totaling 171 million on the lpd22 through lpd25 contract partially offset by a favorable adjustment of 54 million on the lhd8 contract see note 7 contract charges in item 8 activity within each segment is discussed in segment operating results 

fascas adjustment 

the fascas adjustment represents the difference between our retirement related benefit plan expense under fas in accordance with gaap and our pension expense under cas 

the components of the fascas adjustment were as follows 

 

   

2011 —the favorable change in the fascas adjustment of 36 million in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by a decrease in our fas expense due primarily to favorable asset returns in 2010 coupled with offsetting higher cas costs primarily due to demographics 

for 2012 we expect our fas expense will increase more than our cas expense which will increase the fascas adjustment we expect the fascas adjustment to be approximately 77 million the expected unfavorable increase from 2011 is primarily driven by lower discount rates the expected increase in fas expense in excess of cas expense is subject to update during 2012 when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with final 2011 census data this estimate does not include any potential change for the harmonization rule after 2012 the fascas adjustment is more difficult to predict because future fas and cas expense is based on a number of key assumptions for future periods differences between those assumptions and actual results as well as the effects of the harmonization rule could significantly change both fas and cas expense in future periods 

2010 —the fascas adjustment was an expense of 49 million and 88 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in net expense in 2010 was primarily due to lower gaap pension expense principally as a result of favorable returns on pension plan assets in 2009 

deferred state income taxes 

deferred state income taxes reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities in the relevant period these amounts are recorded within operating income while the current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income 

2011 —the benefit provided by deferred state income taxes in 2011 was 1 million compared to a benefit of 3 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to the timing of contract related income and deductions 

2010 —the benefit provided by deferred state income taxes in 2010 was 3 million compared to a benefit of 15 million in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to the timing of contract related deductions 

interest expense 

2011 —interest expense in 2011 was 104 million compared to 40 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to interest expense on our senior notes and our credit facility established in connection with the spinoff these increases were partially offset by the elimination of intercompany indebtedness to northrop grumman as of march 30 2011 

2010 —interest expense in 2010 increased 4 million as compared with 2009 the increase was primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2010 which resulted from a lower level of longterm capital projects in 2010 as compared to 2009 

other net 

2011 —there were no significant transactions recorded in other net during 2011 compared to the 2 million net expense recorded in 2010 

2010 —other net for 2010 decreased 3 million as compared with 2009 the decrease was primarily due to the writeoff of 2 million of capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the partial retirement of go zone irbs in the fourth quarter of 2010 pursuant to a tender offer see financing activities below and note 13 debt in item 8 

federal income taxes 

2011 —our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations excluding the 2011 noncash goodwill impairment charge of 290 million which is nondeductible for income tax purposes was 338 in 2011 as compared to 345 in 2010 our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate due to a domestic manufacturing deduction the research and development credit nondeductible expenditures and noncash federal tax adjustments governed by our tax matters agreement with northrop grumman the effective tax rate for 2011 was lower than 2010 due to higher domestic manufacturing deductions research and development credits and the noncash tax adjustments in 2011 related to our tax matters agreement with northrop grumman see note 12 income taxes in item 8 

  

2010 —our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for 2010 was 345 compared with 295 in 2009 the increase in effective tax rate was due to the elimination of certain tax benefits with the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 a decrease in the manufacturers’ deduction and the expiration of wage credit benefits partially offset by the effects of a settlement with the internal revenue service and the us congressional joint committee on taxation of our parent’s tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 see note 12 income taxes in item 8 

segment operating results 

basis of presentation 

we are aligned into two reportable segments ingalls and newport news 

 

  

 key segment financial measures 

sales and service revenues 

periodtoperiod sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume unless otherwise described volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 

segment operating income loss 

segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance including net pension and postretirement benefits expenses and deferred state income taxes changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume as discussed above or performance performance refers to changes in contract margin rates these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded segment operating income may also be affected by among other things contract performance the effects of workforce stoppages the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes resolution of disputed items with the customer recovery of insurance proceeds and other discrete events at the completion of a longterm contract any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings where such items have occurred and the effects are material a separate description is provided 

  

ingalls 

 

 sales and service revenues 

2011 —ingalls revenues decreased 142 million or 5 compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues in surface combatants partially offset by higher revenues in amphibious assault ships programs and the nsc program the decrease in surface combatants revenues was primarily due to lower revenues on the ddg51 program following the delivery of ddg110 uss william p lawrence in the first quarter of 2011 and ddg107 uss gravely in the third quarter of 2010 partially offset by higher revenues on ddg113 john finn in 2011 the increase in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to higher revenues on lpd26 john p murtha and the lha program partially offset by lower revenues on lpd22 san diego and lpd24 arlington  the increase in the nsc program was primarily due to higher revenues on the fourth nsc for which the contract was awarded in the fourth quarter of 2010 partially offset by lower revenues on nsc3 uscgc stratton which was delivered in the third quarter of 2011 

2010 —ingalls revenues increased 162 million or 6 from 2009 primarily driven by 339 million higher sales in expeditionary warfare partially offset by 122 million lower sales in surface combatants and 62 million lower sales in coast guard  coastal defense the increase in expeditionary warfare was due to higher sales volume in the lpd program and on lha6 america  partially offset by lower sales in 2010 due to the delivery of lhd8 uss makin island in 2009 the decrease in surface combatants was primarily due to lower sales volume on the ddg51 program following delivery of ddg105 uss dewey in the third quarter of 2009 the decrease in coast guard  coastal defense was primarily due to lower sales volume following delivery of nsc2 uscgc waesche in the fourth quarter of 2009 

segment operating income loss 

2011 —ingalls operating loss was 220 million compared to a loss of 61 million in 2010 the higher loss was primarily the result of the 2011 goodwill impairment charge previously described partially offset by the 2010 113 million pretax charge resulting from our decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility and the charges and adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2010 as previously described 

2010 —ingalls operating loss was 61 million compared to a loss of 29 million in 2009 the increase in operating loss was caused primarily by unfavorable performance on expeditionary warfare programs and a lower level of operating income on other programs resulting from the sales volume reductions described above in expeditionary warfare we recorded net performance adjustments of 132 million on the lpd22 through lpd25 contract including the effect of a 113 million charge for the cumulative effect of the 210 million of incremental costs expected in connection with our decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at the avondale facility in 2013 see note 4 avondale wind down in item 8 additionally we recognized an unfavorable adjustment of 30 million to reflect additional costs to complete postdelivery work on lhd8 uss makin island see note 7 contract charges in item 8 in 2009 operating income included a favorable adjustment of 54 million on the lhd8 contract which was more than offset by unfavorable adjustments of 38 million and 171 million on the ddg51 and lpd programs respectively 

newport news 

 

   

sales and service revenues 

2011 —newport news revenues remained stable at 3766 million in 2011 compared to 3775 million in 2010 lower revenues in aircraft carriers and fleet support were offset by higher revenues in submarines the decrease in aircraft carriers revenues was primarily due to lower revenues on the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh the cvn65 uss enterprise extended drydocking selected restricted availability “edsra” and the post shakedown availability “psa” for cvn77 uss george hw bush these decreases in aircraft carriers revenues were partially offset by higher revenues on cvn78 gerald r ford the advance construction contract for cvn79 john f kennedy and the advance planning contract for cvn72 uss abraham lincoln rcoh the decrease in fleet support revenues was primarily driven by lower activity in the san diego fleet maintenance market the increase in submarines revenues was primarily due to higher revenues on the construction of ssn774 virginia class submarines 

2010 —newport news revenues increased 241 million or 7 from 2009 primarily driven by 148 million higher sales in aircraft carriers and 108 million higher sales in submarines the increase in aircraft carriers was primarily due to higher sales volume on cvn78 gerald r ford and cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh partially offset by lower volume in 2010 on cvn77 uss george hw bush and cvn70 uss carl vinson rcoh both of which were completed in the second quarter of 2009 the increase in submarines was primarily due to higher sales volume on the construction of ssn774 virginia class submarines 

segment operating income loss 

2011 —newport news operating income was 342 million compared to 355 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to higher revenues on lower margin programs and risk retirement on the cvn70 uss carl vinson and the cvn77 uss george hw bush that occurred in 2010 partially offset by risk retirement on the ssn774 virginia class submarine program in 2011 

2010 —newport news operating income was 355 million compared with 313 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to the impact of the sales volume changes described above improved operating performance on aircraft carriers and higher earnings from our equity method investments which totaled 19 million and 10 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively see note 11 business arrangements in item 8 

backlog 

total backlog at december 31 2011 was approximately 163 billion total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity “idiq” orders for contracts having no stated contract values backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

 approximately 33 of the 163 billion total backlog at december 31 2011 is expected to be converted into sales in 2012 total us government orders comprised substantially all of the total backlog at the end of 2011 

awards 

2011 —the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31 2011 was approximately 56 billion significant new awards during this period included contracts for the construction of lpd26 john p murtha  ddg113 john finn and ddg114 ralph johnson  continued engineering and construction of cvn78 gerald r ford  advance 

  

construction of cvn79 john f kennedy construction of the us coast guard’s fifth national security cutter unnamed advance planning efforts for the cvn72 uss abraham lincoln rcoh and continued execution of the cvn71 uss theodore roosevelt rcoh

liquidity and capital resources 

we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses and maximizing stockholder value we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 

the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by used in operating activities 

 

 cash flows 

we discuss below our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 as classified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

2011 —cash provided by operating activities was 528 million in 2011 compared with 359 million in 2010 the increase of 169 million was due principally to increased earnings net of impairment charges and lower pension contributions offset by an increase in trade working capital net cash paid by northrop grumman on our behalf for us federal income tax obligations was 53 million 

we expect cash generated from operations for 2012 to be sufficient to service debt meet contract obligations and finance capital expenditures although 2012 cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations we may from time to time borrow funds under our credit facility to accommodate timing differences in cash flows 

2010 —net cash provided by operating activities was 359 million in 2010 compared with cash used of 88 million in 2009 the change of 447 million was due principally to a decrease in discretionary pension contributions of 97 million a decrease in trade working capital of 299 million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of 79 million in 2009 trade working capital balances included the unfavorable impact of delayed customer billings associated with the negative performance adjustments on the lpd22 through lpd25 contract due to projected cost increases at completion see note 7 contract charges in item 8 the change in deferred taxes was due principally to the timing of contract related deductions us federal income tax payments made by northrop grumman on our behalf were 89 million in 2010 

  

2009 —net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased 427 million as compared with 2008 due primarily to an increase in trade working capital of 366 million and an increase in deferred income taxes of 108 million the trade working capital change resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of delayed customer billings associated with negative performance adjustments on the lpd22 through lpd 25 contract due to projected cost increases at completion see note 7 contract charges in item 8 the change in deferred taxes was due to the timing of contract related deductions us federal income tax payments made by northrop grumman on our behalf were 132 million in 2009 

investing activities 

2011 —cash used by investing activities was 197 million in 2011 consisting entirely of capital expenditures 

2010 —cash used by investing activities was 189 million in 2010 principally for capital expenditures 

2009 —cash used by investing activities was 178 million in 2009 due principally to 181 million in capital expenditures 

financing activities 

2011 —cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was 584 million our cash flow from financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of 1775 million of debt of which 22 million was repaid in 2011 and a 1266 million net transfer from our former parent offset by 54 million of debt issuance costs repayment of 954 million of notes to our former parent and a contribution of 1429 million to northrop grumman as a result of the spinoff 

2010 —in anticipation of the spinoff on november 30 2010 ngsb purchased 178 million of the outstanding principal amount of go zone irbs pursuant to a tender offer ngsb used the proceeds of an intercompany loan for 178 million with northrop grumman to purchase the go zone irbs and submitted the purchased bonds to the trustee for cancellation see note 13 debt in item 8 

for the year ended december 31 2010 and prior transactions between northrop grumman and us were reflected as effectively settled for cash at the time of the transaction and are included in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows the net effect of these transactions is reflected in former parent’s equity in unit in our consolidated statements of financial position 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to consider 

free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner this measure should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance 

the table below reconciles net cash provided by used in operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 pension plan contributions 

we make both required and discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension plans our policy is to fund our qualified defined benefit pension plans at least to the minimum amounts required under us government regulations 

  

contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by the actual return on plan assets and the plan’s funded status we made the following required and discretionary contributions to our retirement related plans 

 

  

  we were not required to make minimum contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2011 2010 or 2009 

in 2012 we expect to make minimum and discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans of approximately 153 million and 65 million respectively exclusive of any us government recoveries we will continue to periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions 

other postretirement benefit payments were 33 million 33 million and 33 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

other sources and uses of capital 

additional capital —we expect cash generated from operations in combination with our existing credit facilities to be sufficient to service debt meet contractual obligations and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months 

in 2011 we issued 1200 million of senior notes consisting of 600 million of 6875 senior notes due in 2018 and 600 million of 7125 senior notes due in 2021 we also entered into the credit facility with thirdparty lenders in an amount of 1225 million comprised of a 575 million term loan due in 2016 with a variable interest rate based on libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio the current spread as of december 31 2011 was 275 and may vary between 20 and 30 and a 650 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2016 with a variable interest rate on drawn borrowings based on libor plus a spread based upon our leverage ratio the current spread as of december 31 2011 was 275 and may vary between 20 and 30 and with a commitment fee rate on the unutilized balance based on our leverage ratio which fee rate at our current leverage ratio as of december 31 2011 was 05 and may vary between 035 and 05 of which approximately 121 million of letters of credit was issued but undrawn as of december 31 2011 and the remaining 529 million of which was unutilized at that time 

financial arrangements —in the ordinary course of business we use standby letters of credit issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to support our selfinsured workers’ compensation plans at december 31 2011 there were 121 million of standby letters of credit issued but undrawn and 297 million of surety bonds outstanding related to our operations 

retirement of debt —immediately prior to the spinoff on march 30 2011 and as of december 31 2010 we had 715 million of promissory notes payable to northrop grumman together with accrued and unpaid interest totaling 248 million and 239 million as of march 30 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively in connection with the spinoff the intercompany debt and accrued interest thereon in their entirety were contributed to our additional paidin capital by northrop grumman we made scheduled term loan payments of 22 million in the year ended december 31 2011 using cash generated from operations 

for a description of our outstanding debt amounts and related restrictive covenants see note 13 debt in item 8 we were in compliance with all debtrelated covenants as of and during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

  

contractual obligations 

in 2011 we issued 1200 million of senior notes and entered into the credit facility with thirdparty lenders in the amount of 1225 million as of december 31 2011 total outstanding longterm debt was 1859 million consisting of these senior notes and the credit facility in addition to 105 million of third party debt that remained outstanding subsequent to the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a transition services agreement with northrop grumman under which northrop grumman or certain of its subsidiaries provides us with certain services to help ensure an orderly transition following the distribution under the transition services agreement northrop grumman provides for up to 12 months following the spinoff certain enterprise shared services including information technology resource planning financial procurement and human resource services benefits support services and other specified services the original term of the transition services agreement ends on march 31 2012 although we have the right to and have cancelled certain services as we transition to new thirdparty providers the services provided by northrop grumman are charged to us at cost and a limited number of these services may be extended for a period of approximately six months to allow full information systems transition see note 20 related party transactions and former parent company equity in item 8 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with northrop grumman the “tax matters agreement” that governs the respective rights responsibilities and obligations of northrop grumman and us after the spinoff with respect to tax liabilities and benefits tax attributes tax contests and other tax sharing regarding us federal state local and foreign income taxes other taxes and related tax returns we have several liabilities with northrop grumman to the irs for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the northrop grumman consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we were part of that group however the tax matters agreement specifies the portion of this tax liability for which we will bear responsibility and northrop grumman has agreed to indemnify us against any amounts for which we are not responsible the tax matters agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spinoff together with certain related transactions is not taxfree see note 20 related party transactions and former parent company equity in item 8 

we do not expect either the transition services agreement or the tax matters agreement to have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 and the related estimated timing of future cash payments 

 

  

   the above table excludes retirement related contributions in 2012 we expect to make minimum and discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans of approximately 153 million and 65 million respectively exclusive of any us government recoveries we will continue to periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions in 2012 we expect to make 35 million in contributions for our other postretirement plans exclusive of any 

  

us government recoveries amounts beyond 2012 for retirement related contributions depend on plan provisions actuarial assumptions actual plan asset performance and other factors previously described under pension costs in critical accounting policies estimates and judgments 

further details regarding longterm debt and operating leases can be found in note 13 debt and note 15 commitments and contingencies in item 8 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than the surety bonds and letters of credit discussed in “other sources and uses of capital” above and operating leases for a description of our operating leases see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 15 commitments and contingencies in item 8
