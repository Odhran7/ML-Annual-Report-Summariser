raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources however certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order where some electronic components have had limited availability due to current global shortages we have worked closely with suppliers to ensure this temporary supply constraint did not have a material adverse effect on continuity of supply 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2021 we owned approximately 4458 united states patents and approximately 7199 patents in other countries 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally 

higher in the fourth quarter the dollar amount of customer backlog orders at any given time is not meaningful to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications certain of our products also fall under other fda classifications such as drugs and human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the european union enacted the european union medical device regulation in may 2017 with an effective date of may 2021 which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems labeling and postmarket surveillance additionally as a result of the exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit new medical device regulations were released by the united kingdom which became effective january 1 2021 a gap analysis against the prior medical device directive mdd and a compliance plan are being implemented for both the european union and united kingdom regulations to ensure compliance and minimize business disruption finally we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each country within which we market and sell our products for example chinas national medical products administration nmpa has recently promulgated more stringent regulatory requirements 

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

price regulation and competitive pricing it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

environment 

we are subject to various rules and regulation in the united states and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we believe our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations we do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property plant and equipment cash flows net earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors tableend

this report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track goal strategy and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that 

refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

covid19 pandemic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has materially adversely affected and could continue to materially adversely affect our operations supply chain manufacturing product distribution customers and other business activities the global covid19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the united states and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown in response various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented and may continue to implement numerous measures to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns a significant number of our customers global suppliers distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been and could continue to be materially affected by restrictive measures implemented in response to the pandemic as a result some of our customers distributors and indirect sales channels have at times been unable to retain employees distribute or use our products or provide required services any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability for example certain of our products contain electronic components and we have experienced and could continue to experience limited product availability due to the electronic components shortage in certain product lines if the shortage persists we may not be able to obtain electronic components from our suppliers on a timely basis or at all or identify any alternative suppliers to provide the electronic components we need to produce our products 

in addition the pandemic could adversely impact our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers manufacturers distributors and customers to retain key employees and ensure the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our and their complex operations to the extent our management or other personnel or the management or other personnel of our thirdparty suppliers manufacturers distributors and customers are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties we could experience delays in or the suspension of our manufacturing operations sales activities research and product development activities regulatory work streams clinical development programs and other important commercial and corporate functions 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

moreover the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient our relationships with our employees may be disrupted due to measures implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market due to labor shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic and responsive measures which has included increased wages offered by other employers and voluntary attrition of our employees and the employees of our thirdparty suppliers manufacturers distributors and customers 

the extent of the pandemic’s effect on our business and industry will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic including future resurgences andor the spread of variants and the successful development distribution and acceptance of vaccines for covid19 all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict we are not able at this time to estimate with certainty the effect of these and other unforeseen factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations has been and could in the future be material a prolonged impact of covid19 also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report 

we have experienced and may continue to experience a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities in response to the covid19 pandemic some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures elective medical procedures were suspended or reduced at various times in 2020 and 2021 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold which negatively affected our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations it is not possible to predict whether elective medical procedures will again be suspended or reduced in the future and to the extent individuals and customers are required to continue to deprioritize delay or cancel elective procedures as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition our products in certain divisions such as medical have experienced and could continue to experience higher demand as our customers focus on treating covid19 patients unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products have exceeded in the past and could exceed in the future our capacity to meet such demand timely which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity in this regard the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or related claims 

legal and regulatory risks 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change  our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform in the countries in which we operate as new guidance and regulations are published in addition further changes in the tax laws could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for 

economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business there have been ongoing litigation and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca we face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification manufacturing sterilization labeling marketing and sale of our products the classification manufacturing sterilization labeling marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda european union the nmpa in china and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory clearances andor approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances andor approvals might not be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system medical device reporting regulations and other requirements costs to comply with regulations including the european union medical device regulation enacted by the european union in may 2017 and effective in may 2021 the free trade agreement between the united kingdom and the european union that became effective january 1 2021 and the regulatory laws established by the nmpa in china and costs associated with remediation can be significant if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery anticorruption antikickback and false claims laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws the relationships that we and thirdparties that market andor sell our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals healthcare organizations and others are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other antibribery and antikickback laws we also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals and others these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to investigate audit and monitor compliance or to alter our practices violations of these laws could result in litigation and we may be subject to criminal or civil penalties and sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs in 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the united states securities and exchange commission sec related to the fcpa pursuant to these settlements we paid fines and penalties and retained an independent compliance consultant we continue to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant’s review of our commercial practices to enhance our commercial business practices 

we are subject to privacy data protection and data security regulations and laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information for example in the united states privacy and security regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 including the expanded requirements under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi further the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to european union customers and employees the gdpr established requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data these laws and regulations are broad 

in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed manufactured and marketed in response to the covid19 pandemic including discretionary products and products permitted under the emergency use authorization granted by the fda we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads and the product liability lawsuits and claims relating to wright legacy hip products discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable further in november 2020 the european parliament voted in favor of the european representative actions directive the collective redress directive which mandates a class action regime in each member state to facilitate domestic and crossborder class actions in a wide range of areas including product liability claims with medical devices the collective redress directive will take effect in 2023 after a 24month implementation period the collective redress directive when implemented could result in additional litigation risks and significant legal expenses for us in addition we may incur significant legal expenses for product liability claims regardless of whether we are found to be liable 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan euro and japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms which could negatively affect our liquidity our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets including disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements in addition we have experienced and could continue to experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers and suppliers facing liquidity issues caused by the covid19 pandemic as a result we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments at least until the consequences of the pandemic subside 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing for example china has implemented a volumebased procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products this has already impacted our joint replacement business on a national level and our trauma and spine products on a provincial level and we expect further adoption of volumebased procurement provincially or nationally in china in 2022 pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new business models products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by us as we continue to innovate to address physician and patient needs or by our existing competitors and new market entrants our existing competitors and new market entrants may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater access to clinical information 

to support ongoing product position in the market have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations such as hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products as a result of the covid19 pandemic our access to these professionals has been limited as hospitals have restricted access for nonpatients including our research and development specialists and other employees and governmental authorities have imposed travel restrictions shutdowns or similar measures which has adversely affected our ability to develop market and sell products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be further adversely affected 

we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of stryker in many markets we rely on indirect distribution channels to market distribute and sell our products these indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professionals and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products our ability to market distribute and sell our products through indirect channels has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the covid19 pandemic including travel restrictions suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit persontoperson contact our ability to continue to market distribute and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels become insolvent choose to sell competitive products choose to stop selling medical technology or are subject to new or additional government regulation whether related to the covid19 pandemic or for unrelated reasons 

we are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries tariffs and other trade protection measures international trade disputes and import or export requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations introduction of new internal business structures and programs political and economic instability such as the united kingdoms exit from the european union brexit and disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like covid19 or otherwise such as reduced availability of transportation port closures increased border controls or closures increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions including our pending acquisition of vocera communications inc such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of

the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force in our highly competitive industry or if we are unable to plan effective succession for the future we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives in addition if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values this could adversely impact our ability to recruit hire develop and retain key talent further the ongoing remote work environment in response to covid19 could harm our culture andor decrease employee engagement which could adversely impact our ability to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business we and our suppliers have manufacturing and supply sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions we have principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in arizona california florida illinois indiana michigan minnesota new jersey tennessee texas utah virginia and washington and outside the united states in china france germany ireland mexico the netherlands puerto rico switzerland and turkey damage to our facilities to our suppliers’ or service providers facilities or to our central distribution centers as a result of natural disasters fires explosions or otherwise as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction it system failures or cybersecurity incidents environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals and we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components devices and thirdparty services in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages price increases or unavailability of thirdparty services could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices and on certain thirdparty service providers such as sterilization service providers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices whether due to inflationary pressure regulatory changes or otherwise in addition several raw materials components finished devices and services are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials components and services prior to their use in or with our products in addition

during 2021 the market experienced increasing inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions labor shortages and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic which we anticipate will continue in 2022 we may experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses caused by the covid19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors and may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations

environmental social and governance esg risks 

we could be negatively impacted by esg and sustainabilityrelated matters governments investors customers employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate esg practices and disclosures and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving on occasion we announce new initiatives including goals under our corporate responsibility framework this framework is aligned with our areas of interest which include environment and sustainability social impact diversity equity and inclusion and supply chain management among others the criteria by which our esg practices are assessed may change due to the quickly evolving landscape which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria moreover the increasing attention to corporate esg initiatives could also result in reduced demand for products reduced profits and increased investigations and litigation if we are unable to satisfy such new criteria investors may conclude that our policies andor actions with respect to esg matters are inadequate if we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals our reputation business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

physical effects of climate change or legal regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our operations and operating results risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal regulatory and political focus in the united states and globally shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires droughts extreme temperatures or flooding which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals medical care facilities and other customers reduced workforce availability increased costs of raw materials and components increased liabilities and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events in addition increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of 

climate change which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations such developments could result in increased compliance costs and adverse impacts on raw material sourcing manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products which could adversely affect our operations and operating results

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the covid19 pandemic operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3263 3277 and 2191 in 2021 2020 and 2019 the slight decrease from 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable partially offset by increased net earnings and accounts payable 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 859 4701 and 1455 in 2021 2020 and 2019 the decrease in cash used in 2021 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions and certain other businesses and related assets in 2020 we acquired wright while in 2019 we acquired mobius imaging and cardan robotics and certain other businesses and related assets 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 2365 11 and 3 in 2021 2020 and 2019 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by longterm debt repayments of 1151 and dividend payments of 950 in 2021 in 2020 we secured a 400 term loan in november issued 600 of notes in november and 2300 of notes in june which was offset by total debt repayments of 2297 and dividend payments of 863 there were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020 

we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 



liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3019 and 3024 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 5468 and 4666 on december 31 2021 and 2020 we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines in october 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated august 19 2016 the primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by 750 to 2250 extend the maturity date to october 26 2026 increase the leverage ratio to 375 and provide libor replacement language 

we raised funds in the capital markets in 2020 and 2019 and may continue to do so from timetotime we continue to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 26 and 30 on december 31 2021 and 2020 we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in 2021 we recorded charges to earnings related to the rejuvenate and abg ii and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to wright legacy hip products claims recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2021 we had a reserve for 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

uncertain income tax positions of 444 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2021 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 493 of which approximately 491 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are certain accounting policies which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our 

financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or 



stryker corporation 2021 form 10k 

brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in some of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until the research is completed then it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use then it is impaired for asset acquisitions iprd is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information in certain circumstances we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the carrying value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual carrying values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of 

the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for certain claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

also in 2020 stryker launched the next generation trevo product and line extensions of numerous access products 

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources however certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2020 we owned approximately 4045 united 

states patents and approximately 6407 patents in other countries 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter the dollar amount of customer backlog orders at any given time is not meaningful to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications certain of our products also fall under the fdas drug classification as well as other fda classifications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu adopted the european medical device directives which form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition the eu enacted the eu medical device regulation eu mdr in may 2017 with an effective date of may 2021 which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems labeling and postmarket surveillance more recently a free trade agreement was executed between the uk and the eu that became effective january 1 2021 a gap analysis and compliance plan is being implemented to ensure compliance and minimize business 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

disruption finally we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each country within which we market and sell our products including china whose national medical products administration nmpa has recently promulgated more stringent regulatory requirements 

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

environment 

we are subject to various rules and regulation in the united states and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we believe our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations we do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property plant and equipment cash flows net earnings or competitive position

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

covid19 pandemic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has materially adversely affected and could continue to materially adversely affect our operations supply chain manufacturing product distribution and other business activities the global covid19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the united states and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown in response various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented and may continue to implement numerous measures to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns a significant number of our global suppliers vendors distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been and could continue to be materially affected by restrictive government measures implemented in response to the pandemic as a result some of our distributors and indirect channels have at times been unable to distribute our products or provide required services any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability 

in addition the pandemic could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex productions as well as our executive officers and other members of our management team thirdparty suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors to the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties we could experience delays in or the suspension of our manufacturing operations research and product development activities regulatory work streams clinical development programs and other important commercial functions moreover the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient further our relationships with our employees may be disrupted due to the costsaving and other measures implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including employee furloughs which could result in increased employment litigation and claims for severance or other benefits tied to terminations or furloughs or attempts to unionize portions of our workforce the extent of the pandemic’s effect on our business will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic and the successful development distribution and acceptance of vaccines for covid19 all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict we are not able at this time to estimate with certainty the effect of these and other unforeseen factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations could be material a prolonged impact of covid19 also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report 

we have experienced and may continue to experience a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

governmental authorities in response to the covid19 pandemic some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures elective medical procedures were suspended especially in the first and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold which negatively affected our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations it is not possible to predict the exact timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures and to the extent individuals are required to continue to deprioritize delay or cancel elective procedures as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition our products in certain divisions such as medical have experienced and could continue to experience higher demand as our customers focus on treating covid19 patients unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand timely which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity in this regard the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or related claims 

further in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in response to the pandemic governments may require us such as under the united states defense production act to allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that adversely affects our regular operations results in differential treatment of customers andor adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships it is also possible that certain of our operations are deemed nonessential and thus subject to suspension or other restrictions by government orders we cannot predict how these changes in operations if implemented would affect our future operations and commercial activities as the impact of the pandemic begins to subside

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law in the united states we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform as new guidance and regulations are published in addition further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax 

authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business there have been ongoing litigation and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca we face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification manufacturing labeling marketing and sale of our products the classification manufacturing sterilization labeling marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda european union eu the nmpa in china and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory clearances andor approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances andor approvals might not be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system medical device reporting regulations and other requirements costs to comply with regulations including the eu medical device regulation enacted by the eu in may 2017 and effective in may 2021 the free trade agreement recently executed between the uk and the eu that became effective january 1 2021 and the regulatory laws established by the nmpa in china and costs associated with remediation can be significant if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery anticorruption antikickback and false claims laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws the relationships that we and thirdparties that market andor sell our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals healthcare organizations and others are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other antibribery and antikickback laws we also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals and others these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs in 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the united states securities and exchange commission sec related to the fcpa pursuant to these settlements we paid fines and penalties and retained an independent compliance consultant we are working to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant’s review of our commercial practices 

we are subject to privacy data protection and data security regulations and laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information for example in the united states privacy and security regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 including the expanded requirements under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi further the eu’s general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and employees the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed manufactured and marketed in response to the covid19 pandemic including discretionary products and products permitted under the emergency use authorization granted by the fda we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads and the product liability lawsuits and claims relating to wright legacy hip products discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and 

outcomes are not predictable further in november 2020 the european parliament voted in favor of the european representative actions directive the collective redress directive which mandates a class action regime in each member state to facilitate domestic and crossborder class actions in a wide range of areas including product liability claims with medical devices the collective redress directive will take effect in 2023 after a 24month implementation period the collective redress directive when implemented could result in additional litigation risks and significant legal expenses for us in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro and japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms which could negatively affect our liquidity our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets including disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements in addition we have experienced and could continue to experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers and suppliers facing liquidity issues caused by the covid19 pandemic as a result we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments at least until the consequences of the pandemic subside 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing for example china has implemented a volumebased procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations such as hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products as a result of the covid19 pandemic our access to these professionals has been limited as hospitals have restricted access for nonpatients including our research and development specialists and other employees and governmental authorities have imposed travel restrictions shutdowns or similar measures which has adversely affected our ability to develop market and sell products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be further adversely affected 

we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of stryker in many markets we rely on indirect distribution channels to market distribute and sell our products these indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professional and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products our ability to market distribute and sell our products through indirect channels has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the covid19 pandemic including 

travel restrictions suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit persontoperson contact our ability to continue to market distribute and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels become insolvent choose to sell competitive products choose to stop selling medical technology or are subject to new or additional government regulation whether related to the covid19 pandemic or for unrelated reasons 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive global operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries tariffs and other trade protection measures international trade disputes and import or export requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations introduction of new internal business structures and programs political and economic instability such as the united kingdoms exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit and disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like covid19 or otherwise such as reduced availability of transportation port closures increased border controls or closures increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of management time that could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable 

we may be unable to capitalize on the wright acquisition the success of the wright acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate wright into our businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies from the transaction if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the integration of wright into stryker may result in material challenges including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies blending the cultures of stryker and wright maintaining employee morale and retaining key management sales and other employees retaining existing business and operational relationships the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems continuing the regular and uninterrupted cadence of product launches and unforeseen 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

costs expenses and liabilities including litigation related liabilities associated with the acquisition 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites cloud and saas solutions data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and product offerings as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data a security breach whether of our products of our customers’ network security and systems or of thirdparty hosting services could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures in addition a greater number of our employees working remotely during the covid19 pandemic has exposed us and may continue to expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and cyberliability if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force in our highly competitive industry we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives in addition if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values this could adversely impact our ability to recruit hire develop and retain key talent 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business we and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in florida georgia minnesota new jersey tennessee and virginia and outside the united states in china france germany ireland and switzerland medsurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in arizona california florida illinois michigan puerto rico texas and washington and outside the united states in france germany ireland mexico switzerland and turkey neurotechnology and spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in illinois utah and virginia and outside the united states in china france ireland and switzerland damage to our facilities to our suppliers’ or service providers facilities or to our central distribution centers in indiana and the netherlands as a result of natural disasters or otherwise as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals and we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components devices and thirdparty services in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages price increases or unavailability of thirdparty services could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices and on certain thirdparty service providers such as sterilization service providers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices in addition several raw materials components finished devices and services are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials components and services prior to their use in or with our products 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses we maintain thirdparty insurance to cover our exposure to certain property and casualty losses and are selfinsured for claims and expenses related to other property and casualty losses including product liability intellectual property infringement and enforcement environmental and cybersecurity and data privacy losses we manage a portion of our exposure to selfinsured losses through a whollyowned captive insurance company insurance coverage limits provided by thirdparty

earnings were significantly negatively impacted by the global response to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 net earnings decreased to 1599 or 420 per diluted share from 2083 or 548 per diluted share in 2019 and 3553 or 934 per diluted share in 2018 adjusted net earnings per diluted share 1 of 743 decreased 100 from 826 in 2019 compared to 731 in 2018 the impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately 002 014 and 006 in 2020 2019 and 2018 



nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted research development and engineering expenses adjusted operating income adjusted other income expense net adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps free cash flow and free cash flow conversion we believe these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes 

percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions which affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 

1 acquisition and integrationrelated costs  costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs eg inventory stepup and deal costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process 

2 amortization of purchased intangible assets  periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets 

3 restructuringrelated and other charges  costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries workforce reductions elimination of product lines certain longlived asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuringrelated activities 

4 medical device regulations costs specific to updating our quality system product labeling asset writeoffs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the european union and china regulations for medical devices 

5 recallrelated matters  our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the rejuvenate lfit v40 and other product recalls 

6 regulatory and legal matters  our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements 

7 tax matters  charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items 

to measure free cash flow we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property plant and equipment and proceeds from longlived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments to measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings 

because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit selling general and administrative expenses

below we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the covid19 pandemic operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases however in 2019 we announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program for 2020 and 2021 we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3277 2191 and 2610 in 2020 2019 and 2018 the increase from 2019 was primarily due to cash from working capital including higher accounts receivable collections less spending on inventory due to lower production from lower sales and an increase in our accounts payable partially offset by decreased net earnings 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 4701 1455 and 2857 in 2020 2019 and 2018 the increase in cash used in 2020 was primarily due to the acquisition of wright and orthosensor in 2019 we acquired mobius and certain other businesses and related assets in 2018 we acquired entellus and k2m 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 11 3 and 1329 in 2020 2019 and 2018 the change in cash was primarily driven by securing a 400 term loan in november 2020 the issuance of 600 of notes in november 2020 and 2300 of notes in june 2020 offset by total debt repayments of 2297 and dividend payments of 863 in 2020 this is compared to the issuance of €24 billion of notes in november 2019 and repayments of 1342 of debt dividend payments of 778 and share repurchases of 307 in 2019 share repurchases were suspended in 2020 

we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 



liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3024 and 4425 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 4666 and 6658 on december 31 2020 and 2019 despite the impact from the covid19 pandemic we anticipate being able to 

support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper existing credit lines and capital expenditure and operating expense reductions we maintain a revolving credit facility with 15 billion of committed capital which expires in august 2023 and a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in april 2021 

we raised funds in the capital markets in 2020 2019 and 2018 and may continue to do so from timetotime we continue to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 30 and 25 on december 31 2020 and 2019 we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in 2020 we recorded charges to earnings related to the rejuvenate and abg ii lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to wright legacy hip products claims recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2020 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of 457 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2020 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 596 of which approximately 588 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 





stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are certain accounting policies which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax 

positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in some of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until the research is completed then it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use then it is impaired for asset acquisitions iprd is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each 



stryker corporation 2020 form 10k 

year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than 

those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for certain claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2019 we owned approximately 3392 united states patents and approximately 5491 international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter 

 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications certain of our products also fall under the fdas drug classification as well as other fda classifications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu adopted the european medical device directives which form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition the eu enacted the eu medical device regulation eu mdr in may 2017 with an effective date of may 2020 which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems labeling and postmarket surveillance finally we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries including china in which we market our products 

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track goal strategy and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law in the united states we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform as new guidance and regulations are published in addition further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business there have been ongoing judicial and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca  among other things the aca imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to united states sales which are a majority of our medical device sales congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 and the suspension was once again upheld in january 2018 for two years in december 2019 the excise tax was permanently repealed we face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect 



stryker corporation 2019 form 10k 

of any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification manufacturing labeling marketing and sale of our products the classification manufacturing labeling marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda european union eu the national medical products administration nmpa in china and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory clearances andor approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances andor approvals might not be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system medical device reporting regulations and other requirements costs to comply with regulations including the eu medical device regulation enacted by the eu in may 2017 and effective in may 2020 and the regulatory laws established by the nmpa in china and costs associated with remediation can be significant if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery and anticorruption laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws the relationships that we and third parties that market andor sell our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals and other healthcare organizations are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other antibribery laws we also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs in 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the securities and exchange commission sec related to the fcpa pursuant to these settlements we paid fines and penalties and we are working with an independent compliance consultant to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant’s review of our commercial practices 

we are subject to data privacy and protection regulations and laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information for example europe’s general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related 

 

to products and services that we offer to eu customers and employees the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation 



stryker corporation 2019 form 10k 

effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations such as hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected 

we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of stryker in many markets we rely on indirect distribution channels to market distribute and sell our products these indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professional and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products our ability to continue to market distribute and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels choose to sell competitive products choose to stop selling medical technology or are subject to new or additional government regulation 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive global operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement 

 

changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries tariffs and other trade protection measures international trade disputes and import or export requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations introduction of new internal business structures and programs and political and economic instability such as the united kingdoms exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of management time that could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable 

we may be unable to close the wright medical acquisition or if the acquisition does close to capitalize on it the completion of the acquisition of wright medical group nv wright is subject to a number of conditions the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions including the receipt of required regulatory clearances could delay the completion of the transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all any delay in completing the transaction could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction or to realize them on a different timeline than expected in addition the terms and conditions of the required regulatory clearances for the acquisition may impose requirements limitations or costs that may materially delay the completion of the transaction or could materially adversely affect the expected benefits of the transaction any breach by us of the acquisition agreement could also subject us to material liabilities related to the transaction 

if completed the success of the wright acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate wright into our businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies from the transaction if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the integration of wright into stryker may result in material challenges including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies maintaining employee morale and retaining key management sales and other employees retaining existing business and operational relationships the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen costs expenses and liabilities including litigation related liabilities associated with the acquisition 

we may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that 



stryker corporation 2019 form 10k 

impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites cloud and saas solutions data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and product offerings as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data a security breach whether of our products of our customers’ network security and systems or of thirdparty hosting services could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force in our highly competitive industry we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives in addition if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values this could adversely impact our ability to recruit hire develop and retain key talent 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business we and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in florida indiana new jersey and virginia and outside the united states in china france germany ireland netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom medsurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in arizona california florida illinois indiana michigan puerto rico texas and washington and outside the united states in france germany ireland mexico switzerland turkey and the united kingdom neurotechnology and spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in california illinois indiana utah and virginia and outside the united states in china france ireland and switzerland damage to our facilities to our suppliers’ facilities or to our central distribution centers in indiana and the netherlands as a result of natural disasters or otherwise as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components devices and thirdparty services in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages price increases or unavailability of thirdparty services could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices and on certain thirdparty service providers such as sterilization service providers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices in addition several raw materials components finished devices and services are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials components and services prior to their use in or with our products

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted research development and engineering expenses adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps we believe these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions which affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 



 

 because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit selling general and administrative expenses research development and engineering expenses operating income other income expense net effective income tax rate net earnings and net earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of consolidated results of operations below we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of nongaap net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases however when we issued the €24 billion of senior unsecured notes we announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program for 2020 and 2021 we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operations was 2191  2610 and 1559 in 2019  2018 and 2017  the decrease from 2018 was primarily due to higher usage of cash from working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory and lower net earnings partially offset by payments related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and higher recall charges the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 900  329  and 461 of cash in 2019  2018 and 2017  

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1455  2857 and 1613 in 2019  2018 and 2017  the decrease in cash used in 2019 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions primarily the 360 acquisition of mobius and 442 related to certain other 

 

businesses and related assets in 2018 we acquired entellus and k2m in 2017 we acquired novadaq and certain other businesses and related assets 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 3  1329 and  794  in 2019  2018 and 2017  in 2019 the issuance of €24 billion of senior unsecured notes was mostly offset by 1342 repayments on longterm debt 778 dividends paid and 307 repurchases of our common stock in january 2020 we repaid 500 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4375 that were due on january 15 2020  

we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 



liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4425 and 3699  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 6960 and 4926 on december 31 2019 and 2018  we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines we raised funds in the capital markets in 2019 and 2018 and may continue to do so from time to time 

as a result of the announcement of the planned acquisition of wright standard  poors downgraded our corporate credit and longterm issuelevel rating to a from a nevertheless we continue 



stryker corporation 2019 form 10k 

to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 

we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required we have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of 1500  the amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is 1500  

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 25 and 25 on december 31 2019 and 2018  we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in 2019 we recorded charges to earnings related to the rejuvenate and abg ii and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads recall matters recorded charges represent the minimum of the range of probable cost to resolve these matters the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2019 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of 472  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2019 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 441  of which approximately 434 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are certain accounting policies which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application we believe these accounting policies and the 

 

others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings 



stryker corporation 2019 form 10k 

repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in some of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until the research is completed then it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use then it is impaired for asset acquisitions iprd is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine 

 

the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources however certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2018  we owned approximately 3068  united states patents and approximately 4716  international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications certain of our products also fall under the fdas drug classification as well as other fda classifications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu adopted the european medical device directives which form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition the eu enacted the eu medical device regulation eu mdr in may 2017 with an effective date of may 2020 which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems labeling and postmarket surveillance finally we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries including china in which we market our products 

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

environment 

we are subject to various rules and regulation in the united states and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we believe our policies practices and procedures are properly designed to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations we do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property plant and equipment cash flows net earnings or competitive position 

employees 

on december 31 2018  we had approximately 36000  employees globally

this report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track goal strategy and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and 

 

adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law in the united states we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform as new guidance and regulations are published in addition further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business among other things the aca imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to united states sales which are a majority of our medical device sales congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 the suspension was once again upheld in january 2018 for two years if the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended the tax will adversely impact future results of operations after the current suspension expires in december 2019 we also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda european union eu the safe food and drug administration sfda in china and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not 



stryker corporation 2018 form 10k 

be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system medical device reporting regulations and other requirements costs to comply with regulations including the eu medical device regulation enacted by the eu in may 2017 and effective in may 2020 and the regulatory laws established by the sfda in china and costs associated with remediation can be significant if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery and anticorruption laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws  the relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws we also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

we are subject to data privacy and protection regulations and laws globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data for example europe’s general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and employees the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of total company revenue other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been and in the future could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters 

 

including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures  initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and 



stryker corporation 2018 form 10k 

hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations  we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions  in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of management time that could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable 

we may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units  we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant 

 

reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites cloud and saas solutions data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and product offerings as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data a security breach whether of our products of our customers’ network security and systems or of thirdparty hosting services could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented 



stryker corporation 2018 form 10k 

competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business  we and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in new jersey pennsylvania and florida and outside the united states in china ireland netherlands switzerland germany and the united kingdom medsurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in michigan california illinois indiana washington florida and texas and outside the united states in ireland germany mexico puerto rico switzerland turkey france and the united kingdom neurotechnology and spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in illinois indiana utah pennsylvania and california and outside the united states in china ireland france switzerland and netherlands damage to these facilities as a result of natural disasters or otherwise as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components or devices in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products  our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices in addition several raw materials components and finished devices are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage sales growth in constant currency and excluding the impact of the adoption of asc 606 percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps we believe these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and the impact of the adoption of asc 606 which affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and the adoption of asc 606 to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operations was 2610  1559  and 1915  in 2018  2017  and 2016  the increase was primarily due to lower recallrelated payments higher net earnings and cash receipts related to contracts with customers for unsatisfied performance obligations partially due to the adoption of asc 606 and cash receipts from an interest rate hedge settlement partially offset by payments related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 329  461  and 507  of cash in 2018  2017  and 2016  

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 2857  1613  and 4191  in 2018  2017  and 2016  the increase in cash used in 2018 was primarily due to increased payments for acquisitions primarily the 697 acquisition of entellus and 1400 acquisition of k2m in 2017 we acquired novadaq and certain other businesses and related assets in 2016 the primary acquisitions were sage and physio 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities was 1329 794 and 2258 in 2018 2017 and 2016 the increase in cash provided was primarily due to higher net borrowings primarily the issuance of €2250 of senior unsecured notes partially offset by 70 higher repurchases of our common stock and a 67 increase in dividends paid 

we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including 

 

acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 



liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3699  and 2793  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 4926  and 4508  on december 31 2018  and 2017  we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines we raised funds in the capital markets in 2018 and may continue to do so from time to time we continue to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed 

we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required we have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of 1500  the amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is 1500  

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 25  and 62  on december 31 2018  and 2017  we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in 2018  we recorded charges to earnings related to the rejuvenate and abg ii and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads recall matters recorded charges represent the minimum of the range of probable cost to resolve these matters the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2018  we had a reserve for uncertain 



stryker corporation 2018 form 10k 

income tax positions of 528  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2018  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 359  of which approximately 336  related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are certain accounting policies which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition   actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax 

 

return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and 



stryker corporation 2018 form 10k 

technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in some of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until the research is completed then it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use then it is impaired for asset acquisitions iprd is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by 

 

an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources however certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2017  we owned approximately 2674  united states patents and approximately 3886  international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

 

research and development 

continued investment in research and development activities is critical to drive future growth and supports our strategy to make healthcare better through development of products and services that improve patient outcomes most of our products and product improvements were developed internally at research facilities in the united states china france germany india ireland puerto rico sweden switzerland and united kingdom we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total cost of research development and engineering activities were 787  715  and 625  in 2017 2016 and 2015 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu adopted the european medical device directives which form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries in which we market our products 

initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

environment 

we are subject to various rules and regulation in the united states and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we believe our policies practices and 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

procedures are properly designed to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations we do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property plant and equipment cash flows net earnings or competitive position 

employees 

on december 31 2017 we had approximately 33000  employees globally 

executive officers 



each of our executive officers was elected by our board of directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the board of directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2018  or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal each of our executive officers held the position above or served stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years except for ms fink and mr sagar prior to joining stryker in october 2013 ms fink held a variety of senior level human resources roles for the previous six years at johnson  johnson most recently as the worldwide vice president human resources of ethicon while at stryker ms fink held two different senior level human resource roles prior to joining stryker in may 2014 mr sagar served as the chief information officer for merck millipore and before that as global head of information systems and a member of the divisional board for the chemicals division of merck kgaa mr mclean was appointed to the position of president asiapacific effective january 1 2017 prior to this role mr mclean held a variety of senior level leadership roles at stryker since 2005

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law in the united states we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform and expect our effective tax rate to increase in addition further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain  in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business among other things the aca imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to united states sales which are a majority of our medical device sales congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 the suspension was once again upheld in january 2018 for two years if the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended the tax will adversely impact future results of operations after the current suspension expires in december 2019 we also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda european union and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system medical device reporting regulations and other requirements costs to comply with regulations including the regulations set for medical devices regulation enacted by the european union in may 2017 and effective in 2020 and costs associated with remediation can be significant if we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery and anticorruption laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws  the relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws we also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is 

 

characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  we report our financial results in united states dollars and 27 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the euro japanese yen australian dollar british pound and canadian dollar cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures  initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations  we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions  in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of management time that could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable 

we may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units  we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including 

 

inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers  we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business  we and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in new jersey indiana pennsylvania utah and florida and outside the united states in china ireland netherlands switzerland and germany medsurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in michigan california illinois washington utah florida and texas and outside the united states in ireland germany mexico puerto rico switzerland turkey and the united kingdom neurotechnology and spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in illinois indiana and california and outside 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

the united states in china and netherlands damage to these facilities as a result of natural disasters or otherwise as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components or devices in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products  our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices in addition several raw materials components and finished devices are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products

171  for 2017  2016  and 2015  the effective income tax rate for 2017 includes the impact of complying with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 signed into law in december 2017 partially offset by the benefits from the adoption of asu 201609 compensationstock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting on january 1 2017 and continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of the european regional headquarters the establishment of the european regional headquarters contributed to the lower effective income tax rates in 2016  and 2015  

net earnings 

net earnings in 2017  decreased to 1020  or 268  per diluted share from 1647  or 435  per diluted share in 2016  and 1439  or 378  per diluted share in 2015  the impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately 007  011  and 026  in 2017  2016  and 2015  



nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures 

to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions 

to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 



 

minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements 

 because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income effective income tax rate net earnings and net earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of nongaap earnings per share are the same as those used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operations was 1559  1915  and 981  in 2017  2016  and 2015  the decrease in cash from operations in 2017  was primarily due to higher rejuvenate and abg ii recallrelated payments compared to 2016  and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 461  507  and 231  of cash in 2017  2016  and 2015  

investing activities 

cash used in provided by investing activities was 1613  4191  and 1956  in 2017  2016  and in 2015  

acquisitions net of cash acquired  acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of 831  4332  and 153  in 2017  2016  and 2015  in 2017  we acquired novadaq and certain other businesses and related assets in 2016  the primary acquisitions were sage and physio in 2015  the primary acquisition was chg hospital beds inc 

purchases of property plant and equipment  purchases of property plant and equipment were 598  490  and 270  in 2017  2016  and 2015  capital expenditures in 2017  were primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the development of our global erp system and investments in new and existing plants and equipment to support sales growth 

marketable securities net net cash used in provided by the purchase sale of marketable securities was 183  634  and 2379  in 2017  2016  and 2015  cash provided by the sale of marketable securities in 2016  was used to repay all of our senior unsecured notes that were due in september 2016  cash provided by sales of marketable securities in 2015 was primarily used to make recallrelated payments 

 

financing activities 

dividends and share repurchases  dividends paid per common share increased 118  to 170  per share in 2017  compared to 152  per share in 2016  an increase of 101  from 138  in 2015  



borrowings and repayments of debt  we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 

net proceeds from borrowings were 299  2912  and 48  in 2017  2016  and 2015  in 2017  the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of 500  of senior unsecured notes in january 2017 partially offset by payment of 200 of commercial paper in 2016  the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of 3500 of senior unsecured notes in march 2016 partially offset by repayment of 750 of our senior unsecured notes due in september 2016 refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 2793  and 3384  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 4508  and 4713  on december 31 2017  and 2016  we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs including acquisitions and recallrelated payments from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines we have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2016 moodys downgraded our unsecured note ratings to baa1 from a3 and standard  poors downgraded our corporate credit and longterm issuelevel rating to a from a and our shortterm rating to a1 from a1 nevertheless we continue to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed 

we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required we have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of 1500  the amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is 1500  

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 62  and 84  on december 31 2017  and 2016  the majority of our   cash held in locations outside the united states is considered to be indefinitely reinvested we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in 2017  we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling 104  related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls based on the information received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter was estimated to be approximately 2072  to 2307   2304  to 2539  before 232  of thirdparty insurance recoveries the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2017  we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of 540  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2017  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 338  of which approximately 331  related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are certain accounting policies which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition   actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 



stryker corporation 2017 form 10k 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in some of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until the research is completed then it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use then it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future 

 

cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

geographic areas 

in 2016  approximately 73 of our net sales were generated from customers in the united states additional geographic information is included under results of operations in item 7 of this report and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources however certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order the dollar amount of 

 

backlog orders at any given time is not meaningful to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2016  we owned approximately 2184 united states patents and approximately 3454 international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter 

competition 

in each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces 

we believe our commitment to innovation quality and service and our reputation differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements were developed internally at research facilities in the united states france germany india ireland puerto rico sweden and switzerland we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of research development and engineering activities were 715 625 and 614 in 2016  2015  and 2014  

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu adopted the european medical device directives which form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries in which we market our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies and the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

employees 

on december 31 2016  we had approximately 33000 employees globally the number of employees increased from 2015 largely due to our sage and physio acquisitions certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally 



each of our executive officers was elected by our board of directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the board of directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2017  or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal each of our executive officers held the position above or served stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years except for ms fink and mr sagar prior to joining stryker in october 2013 ms fink held a variety of senior level human resources roles for the previous six years at johnson  johnson most recently as the worldwide vice president human resources of ethicon while at stryker ms fink held two different senior level human resource roles prior to

this report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the reform act are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track goal strategy and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change  proposals for broad reform of the existing united states corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

we cannot predict the overall impact that such proposals may have on our business in addition further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain  in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca was enacted while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time other provisions of the legislation including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business among other things the aca imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to united states sales which are a majority of our medical device sales however congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 we are unable to predict whether the suspension will be continued beyond 2017 we also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements remediation costs can be significant if we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including substantial fines warning letters that require corrective action product seizures recalls the suspension of product manufacturing revocation of approvals exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs substantial fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including antibribery and anticorruption laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws  the relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals such as physicians and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws we also must comply with a variety of other 

 

laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues in addition currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

market risks 

macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions financial difficulties experienced by our customers distributors and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  we report our financial results in united states dollars and 27 of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies including the euro the british pound and the japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements 

business and operational risks 

we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures  initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to control healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant the markets in which we compete are highly competitive new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations  we develop manufacture and distribute our products globally our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs including changes in reimbursement changes in regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions  in addition to internally developed products we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions such investments are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses diversion of management time that could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable 

we may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units  we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges 

we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers  we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives 

interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business  we and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants damage to these facilities or issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals we may experience loss of market share additional expense and harm to our reputation 

we use a variety of raw materials components or devices in our global supply chains production and distribution processes significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the competitive position of our products  our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices in addition several raw materials components and finished devices are procured from a solesource due to the quality considerations unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements if solesource suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require among other things validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit cost of sales excluding specified items adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures 

to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions 

to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends the following are

examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 

 because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other 

 

companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income effective income tax rate net earnings and net earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of nongaap earnings per share are the same as those used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts

financial condition and liquidity 



we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases as necessary we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operations was 1812 899 and 1782 in 2016  2015  and 2014  the increase in cash from operations in 2016  was primarily due to lower rejuvenate and abg ii recallrelated payments compared to 2015 which was partially offset by higher levels of inventory in 2016 the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 507 231 and 249 of cash in 2016  2015  and 2014  

investing activities 

cash used in provided by investing activities was 4191 1956 and 1878 in 2016  2015  and in 2014  

acquisitions  acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of 4332 153 and 916 in 2016  2015  and 2014  in 2016  we acquired sage physio synergetics and certain other businesses and related assets in 2015  the primary acquisition was chg in 2014  the primary acquisitions were patient safety technologies inc pivot medical inc berchtold holding ag and small bone innovations inc 

purchases of property plant and equipment  purchases of property plant and equipment were 490 270 and 233 in 2016  2015  and 2014  capital expenditures in 2016  were primarily due to capital expenditures associated with our global erp system and the construction of a dedicated additive manufacturing facility 

marketable securities net net cash provided by used in the sale of marketable securities was 634 2379 and 729 in 2016  2015  and 2014  cash provided by the sale of marketable securities in 2016 was used to repay all of our senior unsecured notes that were due in september 2016 cash provided by sales of marketable securities in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 used to make recallrelated payments 

financing activities 

dividends and share repurchases  dividends paid per common share increased 101 to 152 per share in 2016  compared to 138 per share in 2015  an increase of 131 from 122 in 2014  



 

borrowings and repayments of debt  we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 

net proceeds from borrowings were 2912 48 and 1159 in 2016  2015  and 2014  in 2016  the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of 3500 of senior unsecured notes in march 2016 partially offset by repayment of 750 of our senior unsecured notes due in september 2016 in 2015  the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in january 2015 refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3384 and 4079 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 4713 and 4441 on december 31 2016  and 2015  we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs including acquisitions and recallrelated payments from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines we have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2016 moodys downgraded our unsecured note ratings to baa1 from a3 and standard  poors downgraded our corporate credit and longterm issuelevel rating to a from a and our shortterm rating to a1 from a1 nevertheless we continue to have strong investmentgrade shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed 

we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required in august 2016 we increased the borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility by 250 to a maximum of 1500 in september 2016 we increased the amount of commercial paper issuable under the commercial paper program by 250 to a maximum of 1500 

on december 31 2016  approximately 84 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the united states compared to 46 on december 31 2015 the majority of our   cash held in locations outside the united states is considered to be indefinitely reinvested we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions 

in january 2017 we sold 500 of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 1800 due on january 15 2019 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in 2016  we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling 144 related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls based on the information received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter was estimated to be approximately 1968 to 2224 2200 to 2456 before 232 of thirdparty insurance recoveries the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2016  we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of 287 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements on december 31 2016  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 280 of which approximately 271 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2017 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition   

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances 



stryker corporation 2016 form 10k 

may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in certain of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted 

 

cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

in 2015  approximately 715 of our revenues were generated from customers in the united states additional geographic information is included under results of operations in item 7 of this report and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order the dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage on december 31 2015  we owned approximately 1884 united states patents and approximately 3014 international patents 

 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter 

competition 

in all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces 

the principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality service and reputation we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the united states france germany india ireland puerto rico and switzerland we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of research development and engineering activities were 625 614 and 536 in 2015 2014 and 2013 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries in which we market our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized particularly in the united states by federal and state government agencies and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

employees 

on december 31 2015  we had approximately 27000 employees globally certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally

this report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the reform act are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain  in 2010 federal legislation to reform the united states healthcare system was enacted into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time we expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations among other things the law imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to united states sales which are a majority of our medical device products sales however in 2015 congress enacted legislation that suspends the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 other provisions of this legislation including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered further we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states on our business and results of operations   

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  we are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims of potential infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio also our issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues and currently pending 

 

or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products   substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely for future products if at all we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations with respect to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and others to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements if we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters product recalls the suspension of product manufacturing monetary fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including fraud and abuse laws as well as antibribery laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws our relationships with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals and those that may market our products are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance we also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

market risks 

macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions financial difficulties experienced by our customers distributors and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30 of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies including the euro the british pound and the japanese yen cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects our results of operations and in some cases cash flows have been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates while we implement currency hedges to partially reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements and results 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or only available to us on unfavorable terms our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including operating requirements current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

business and operational risks 

cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results  initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage for our products or other cost containment measures including any that reduce medical procedure volumes could unfavorably affect our future operating results 

we may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry  our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors competitive factors include price customer service technology innovation quality reputation and reliability our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry 

competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management a higher level of inventory write downs may result 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could decrease 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations  we develop manufacture 

 

and distribute our products globally our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions  in addition to internally developed products we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions investments in medical technology are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us these risks include the activities required to integrate new businesses which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated diversion of management time which could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so which may result in unexpected impairment charges 

we may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations  we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations 

failure of a key information technology system process or site and a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation  we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business in addition our reliance on networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and our responsibilities to governments we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if the it systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of interruptions in our operations and responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives 

an inability to successfully manage the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning erp system could adversely affect our operations and operating results we are in the process of implementing a new global erp system this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective should the system not be implemented successfully or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner it could be disruptive and adversely affect our operations and results of operations including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit cost of sales excluding specified items adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share diluted eps we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures 

to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions 

to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends the following are 

 

examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 

 because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income effective income tax rate net earnings and net earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expense adjusted operating income adjusted other income expense net adjusted net earnings adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted diluted eps with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures

the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of nongaap diluted eps are the same as the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported diluted eps 

financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operations was 899 1782 1886 in 2015 2014 and 2013 the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to recallrelated payments associated with the rejuvenate and abgii recall settlement agreement and the timing of income tax payments 

the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 231 249 and 165 of cash in 2015 2014 and 2013 inventory days on hand for 2015 increased by 5 days from 2014 after increasing eight days in 2014 accounts receivable days sales outstanding for 2015 increased by one day after decreasing one day in 2014 

 

investing activities 

cash provided by investing activities was 1956 in 2015 compared to cash used in investing of 1878 in 2014 and 2217 in 2013 this change is primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 to make recallrelated payments discussed above under operating activities 

acquisitions  acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of 153 916 and 2320 in 2015 2014 and 2013 in 2015 the primary acquisition was chg and in 2014 the primary acquisitions were patient safety technologies inc pivot medical inc berchtold holding ag and small bone innovations inc in 2013 we acquired trauson holdings company limited and mako surgical corp 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 270 233 and 195 in 2015 2014 and 2013 capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily related to acquisition integration support information technology infrastructure upgrades capacity expansion new product introductions innovation and cost savings 

financing activities 

dividends paid  dividends paid per common share increased 98 to 134 per share in 2015 compared to 122 per share in 2014 an increase of 151 from 2013 dividends paid per common share and total dividends paid to common shareholders are included in the following table for 2015 2014 and 2013 



shortterm and longterm debt  we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

net proceeds from borrowings were 48 1159 and 1005 in 2015 2014 and 2013 in 2015 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in january 2015 proceeds in 2014 were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper refer to note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information total debt was 4022 and 3973 in 2015  and 2014  

share repurchases  the total use of cash for share repurchases was 700 100 and 317 in 2015 2014 and 2013 we have decided to suspend our share repurchase program through 2016 

liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4079 and 5000 on december 31 2015  and 2014  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 4441 and 4223 on december 31 2015  and 2014  we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs including recallrelated payments related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines we have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time we have strong shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required on december 31 2015  we had approximately 1236 of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities 

on december 31 2015  approximately 46 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the united states in 2014 we announced that we would begin a repatriation program we completed the program in 2015 and repatriated approximately 18 billion to the united states our remaining cash held outside the united states is considered to be indefinitely reinvested we intend to use this cash to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 

we continually evaluate our receivables particularly in spain portugal italy and greece the southern european region the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately 132 and 154 in 2015 and 2014 including approximately 51 and 78 of sovereign receivables in 2015  and 2014  we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the southern european region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region any nonsovereign exposure in these countries is considered immaterial 

in 2015 we made recallrelated payments of 1202 under our united states rejuvenate and abg ii settlement agreement refer to note 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in 2015 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling 295 related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls based on the information that has been received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated 

 

to be approximately 1824 2056 before 232 of thirdparty insurance recoveries to 2416 the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements on december 31 2015  we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of 313 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements on december 31 2015  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 240 of which approximately 231 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2016 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 

longterm contractual obligations 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition   

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting under the purchase method our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty 

 

valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark andor brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in certain of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions 



stryker corporation 2015 form 10k 

and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

we sell our products globally as a result our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar european currencies in particular the euro swiss franc and the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we develop and manufacture products in the united states canada turkey china france germany ireland puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies this global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 

 

we enter into designated and nondesignated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses for nondesignated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our consolidated statements of earnings for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

we have designated certain longterm intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency the effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31 2015  fair value by approximately 178 we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 

we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2015  the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets and increased the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by 390 refer to note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order the dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage as of december 31 2014  we owned approximately 1900 united states patents and approximately 3400 international patents 

seasonality

stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

competition 

in all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces 

the principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality service and reputation we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the united states ireland puerto rico germany switzerland india and france we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of research development and engineering activities were 614 536 and 471 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification submitted as a 510k and review by the fda before we begin marketing them certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state and local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in europe and other countries in which we market our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses 

 

generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

this report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the reform act are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain  in 2010 federal legislation to reform the united states healthcare system was enacted into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time its provisions become effective at various dates and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not been determined we expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations among other things the law imposed a 23 percent 

 

excise tax on class i ii and iii medical devices that applies to united states sales of a majority of our medical device products other provisions of this legislation including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered further we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modularneck hip stems discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products    the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios   our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection such a failure could allow others to sell products that compete with offerings in our product portfolio also our issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues and currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products   substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations with respect to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements if we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

warning letters product recalls the suspension of product manufacturing monetary fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including fraud and abuse laws as well as antibribery laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws    our relationship with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals and those that may market our products are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance we also must comply with a variety of other laws which protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

market risks 

macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions    financial difficulties experienced by our customers including distributors and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately onethird of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies including the euro the british pound and the japanese yen cross border transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects our results of operations and in some cases cash flows have been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in foreign exchange rates while we implement currency hedges to partially reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our hedging strategies may not be successful and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements and results 

business and operational risks 

cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results   initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage for our products or other cost containment measures including any that reduce medical procedure volumes could unfavorably affect our future operating results 

 

we may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry    our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors competitive factors include price customer service technology innovation quality reputation and reliability our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry 

competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence   the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management a higher level of inventory write downs may result 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could decrease 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations  we develop manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions   in addition to internally developed products we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions investments in medical technology are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us these risks include the activities required to integrate new businesses which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated diversion of management time which could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so which may result in unexpected impairment charges 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

we may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations   we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate   we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations 

failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business  we rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our operations 

a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation we rely extensively on information technology it systems networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability integrity of our data and our responsibilities to governments we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers however because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if the it systems networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or if we or one of 

 

our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives

1 nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit cost of sales excluding specified items adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share eps we believe that 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures 

to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions 

to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings these adjustments are irregular in timing may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends 

the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period 



 

 because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income effective income tax rate net earnings and diluted net earnings per share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the following reconciles the nongaap financial measures adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expense adjusted operating income adjusted other incomeexpense adjusted net earnings adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures

the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these nongaap financial measures are the same as the weightedaverage shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts 

financial condition and liquidity 

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases as necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management economic factors and tax considerations 

operating activities 

operating cash flow was 1782 in 2014  a decrease of 55 and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items recall charges depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes in addition the increase in taxes payable was primarily due to the timing of tax payments associated with tax liabilities arising from the establishment of a european regional headquarters these increases were partially offset by higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 249 of cash in 2014  inventory days on hand increased by eight days compared to 2013 as inventory grew to support higher sales and acquisitions while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by one day compared to 2013 

operating cash flow was 1886 in 2013 an increase of 138 and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes along with a decrease of 278 in cash paid for income taxes associated with the timing of cash payments as well as favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable consumed 165 of cash in 2013 inventory days on hand improved by 1 day due to continued focus on improved inventory management accounts receivable days sales outstanding remained consistent with 2012 

investing activities 

net investing activities resulted in cash consumption of 1878 2217 and 736 in 2014  2013 and 2012 respectively primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending 

acquisitions   acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of 916 in 2014  and 2320 in 2013 in 2014  the cash consumed was primarily for sbi berchtold pst and pivot in 2013  cash consumed was primarily for trauson and mako cash consumed in 2012  of 

 

154 was primarily associated with the acquisition of surpass medical ltd 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth capital expenditures primarily to support integration of acquisitions information technology infrastructure upgrades capacity expansion new product introductions innovation and cost savings were 233 195 and 210 in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

financing activities 

dividend payments    dividends paid per common share increased 151 to 122 per share in 2014  and increased 247  to 106  per share in 2013 as a result of the annual increase in dividends paid per share total dividend payments to common shareholders were 462 401 and 324 in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

shortterm and longterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 

net proceeds from borrowings were 1159 and 1005 in 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2014 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper and proceeds in 2013 were primarily from public offerings of notes refer to note 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

total debt was 3973 and 2764 in 2014  and 2013  respectively 

share repurchases   the total use of cash for share repurchases was 100 317 and 108 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

liquidity 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 5000 and 3980 at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 5209 and 5678 at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs including settlements related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines in the past we have also raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time in the future we have strong shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 

should additional funds be required we had approximately 1289 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at december 31 2014  

at december 31 2014  approximately 68 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the united states during the third quarter of 2014 we announced 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

that we plan to repatriate approximately 2000 in total of cash from outside of the united states in 2015 the remainder of the funds outside of the united states are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 

we continually evaluate our receivables particularly in spain portugal italy and greece the southern european region the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately 154 and 199 at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively including approximately 78 and 103 of sovereign receivables in 2014  and 2013  respectively we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the southern european region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region any nonsovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014  we have recorded charges to earnings totaling 748 representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls based on the information that has been received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately 1534 1713 before 179 of thirdparty insurance recoveries to 2453 the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 260 of which approximately 250 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2014 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 

as further described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014  we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of 315 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are 

 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting under the purchase method our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark andor brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

 

in certain of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we have adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to the 



stryker corporation 2014 form 10k 

consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results we are currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which supersedes and replaces nearly all currentlyexisting guidance under united states generally accepted accounting principles related to revenue recognition including related disclosure requirements this guidance will be effective for us beginning january 1 2017 we have not yet completed an assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

other information 

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

we sell our products throughout the world as a result our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar european currencies in particular the euro swiss franc and the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we develop and manufacture products in the united states china france germany ireland puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 

we enter into designated and nondesignated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses for nondesignated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our consolidated statements of earnings for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other 

 

comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31 2014  fair value by approximately 79 we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 

we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2014  the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by 440 to 134 from 306 as of december 31 2013

in march 2013 we received a warning letter from the united states food and drug administration fda concerning quality system observations made during an inspection and citing us for failing to notify the fda of a product recall and for marketing devices including certain of our neptune waste management systems without a required 510k clearance we were notified in january 2014 that the actions taken to address issues raised in the warning letter are sufficient and no further corrective actions related to the warning letter are required 

in december 2013 we received 510k clearance to market a modified neptune 2 waste management system the neptune 2 waste management system mitigates risk to healthcare workers by eliminating harmful exposure to fluids and smoke in the operating room this constantly closed system collects surgical waste and disposes of it without exposing the operator to contact with infectious fluids and surgical plumes

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order the dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage as of december 31 2013  we owned approximately 1783 united states patents and 3420 international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally stronger in the fourth quarter 

competition 

in all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces 

 

the principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality service and reputation we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the united states ireland puerto rico germany switzerland india and france we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of worldwide companysponsored research development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were 536  471  and 462  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 59  54  and 56  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the spending level in 2013 increased due to the timing of projects and continued investment in new technologies the spending level in 2012 as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the termination of all development of the op1 molecule in late 2011 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before we begin marketing them submitted as a 510k certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives that form a single set of 



medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in which we market our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business in addition business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

employees 

at december 31 2013  we had approximately 25000  employees worldwide certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide

risk factors 

tableend

this report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the reform act are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should 

 

possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include the risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain  in 2010 federal legislation to reform the united states healthcare system was enacted into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time its provisions become effective at various dates and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not been determined we expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations among other things the law imposes a 23 percent excise tax on class i ii and iii medical devices that applies to united states sales of a majority of our medical device products other provisions of this legislation including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered further we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states however any change that lowers reimbursements for our products or reduces medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses and government laws and regulations 



relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements  our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters including those relating to the voluntary recall in 2012 of our rejuvenate and abgii modular neck hip stems discussed in other informationlegal and regulatory matters in item 7 of this report and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable  the company is currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses the ultimate cost to us with respect to pro duct liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products   the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios  our longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection such a failure could allow others to sell products that compete with offerings in our product portfolio also our issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues and currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products  substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations with respect to our products and facilities and are 

 

subject to periodic inspections by the fda to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements if we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters product recalls the suspension of product manufacturing monetary fines and criminal prosecution 

we are subject to federal state and foreign healthcare regulations including fraud and abuse laws as well as antibribery laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws   our relationship with healthcare professionals such as physicians hospitals and those that may market our products are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws in addition the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance we also must comply with a variety of other laws which protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

market risks 

macroeconomic developments such as the recent recessions in europe and the debt crises in certain countries in the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies   the continuing debt crises in certain european union countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european union customers financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars  cross border transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects in addition our sales are translated into united states dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

business and operational risks 

we may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry   our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors competitive factors include price customer service 



technology innovation quality reputation and reliability our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources than us or be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry 

competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management a higher level of inventory write downs may result 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals  we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could decrease 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability our results of operations andor financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions  in addition to internally developed products we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions investments in medical technology are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us these risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated diversion of managements time which could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company in 

 

addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so which may result in unexpected impairment charges 

we may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations 

failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business we rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency percentage organic sales growth adjusted gross profit adjusted selling general and administrative expenses adjusted operating income adjusted other income expense adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth gross profit selling general and administrative expenses operating income other incomeexpense effective income tax rate net earnings and diluted net earnings per share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

results of operations 



net sales increased 42  in 2013 after increasing 42 in 2012 in 2013 net sales grew by 65 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 08 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 14 due to changes in price and 16 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions net sales increased 51 in constant currency net sales in 2012 increased 56 as a result of unit volume and changes in product mix and 12 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 14 due to changes in price and 12 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions 2012 net sales increased 42 in constant currency

consolidated cost of sales 

cost of sales increased 70 in 2013  to 330 of sales compared to 321 in 2012 the medical device excise tax was 09 of sales in the current year cost of sales as a percentage of sales was adversely impacted by changes in selling prices for our products and by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates these effects were offset by improvements in manufacturing productivity cost of sales in 2013  and 2012  includes an additional cost of 28 and 18 respectively related to inventory that was 

 

stepped up to fair value following acquisitions 11 and 5 respectively in restructuring and restructuring related costs and 7 in 2013 for disgorgement of profits associated with a legal settlement cost of sales decreased 11 in 2012  to 321 of sales compared to 338 in 2011  cost of sales in 2012  and 2011  includes an additional cost of 18 and 143 respectively related to inventory that was stepped up to fair value following acquisitions and 5 in 2012 in restructuring and related costs 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses represented 59 of sales in 2013 compared to 54 in 2012  and 56 in 2011  the increased spending level in 2013  was driven by the timing of projects and continued investment in new technologies the spending level in 2012  decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the termination of all development of the op1 molecule in late 2011  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 173 in 2013  and represented 451 of sales compared to 400 in 2012  and 379 in 2011  these expenses included 70 and 37 in 2013  and 2012  respectively of acquisition and integration related charges 622 and 174 respectively related to the rejuvenate abg ii and neptune recalls 62 and 33 in 2013  and 2012  respectively related to regulatory and legal matters 25 in 2013 representing a donation to an educational institution and 4 in 2013 in restructuring related charges excluding the impact of these charges selling general and administrative expenses were 364 of sales in 2013  compared to 372 in 2012  in 2011  general and administrative expenses included the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue 

restructuring charges 

in 2013  2012  and 2011  we recorded 50 2 in cost of sales and 48 in selling general and administrative expense 75  and 76 respectively in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring initiatives the targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth 

other income expense 

other expense increased by 8 in 2013  after increasing by 36 in 2012  net expense in 2013 increased due to lower income from interest and marketable securities offset by hedge gains and lower interest expense the decrease in interest expense was due to favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions that resulted in interest expense credits partially offset by higher interest expense on borrowings the increase in 2012  was primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense in 2011 resulting from settlements reached with the united states internal revenue service irs 

in 2011 we reached a favorable settlement regarding an irs proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to the income tax positions we had taken for our irish cost sharing arrangements we also reached a settlement with the irs with respect to the allocation of income 



with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in puerto rico for the years 2006 through 2009 the higher interest expense in 2012  due to the effect of the 2011  tax settlements was partially offset by higher interest income on our investments due to higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to 2011 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate on earnings was 170 239 and 202  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the effective income tax rate for 2013 includes income tax benefits relating to favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions the effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two german subsidiaries and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed the effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlements with the irs as described above 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the act was signed on january 2 2013 the act provided numerous tax provisions for corporations including an extension of the research tax credit and an extension of certain provisions for companies with significant international operations the provisions originally expired at 

 

december 31 2011 but were retroactively extended through december 31 2013 in 2013 we recorded tax benefits of 13 related to the 2012 research tax credit and other provision of the act

financial condition and liquidity 

operating activities 

operating cash flow was 1886 in 2013  an increase of 138 and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes along with a decrease of 278 in cash paid for income taxes associated with the timing of cash payments as well as favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions these increases were partially offset by higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of 165 of cash in 2013  inventory days on hand improved by 1 day due to continued focus on improved inventory management accounts receivable days sales outstanding remained consistent with 2012 

operating cash flow was 1657  in 2012 an increase of 156  and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable consumed 50  of cash in 2012 inventory reductions contributed  18  of cash as inventory days on hand decreased by 5  days due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management accounts receivable increases from business growth resulted in the consumption of 20  of cash while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days due to timing of sales 

investing activities 

net investing activities resulted in cash consumption of 2217 736 and 2135 in 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending 

acquisitions   acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of 2320 in 2013  and 154 in 2012 in 2013  the cash consumed was primarily for trauson and mako in 2012  cash consumed was primarily for surpass for 99 as well as for milestone payments related to previous acquisitions cash consumed in 2011  of 2066 was primarily for the acquisitions of neurovascular for 1450 orthovita for 316 memometal for 150 and concentric for 135 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth capital expenditures primarily to support integration of acquisitions information technology infrastructure upgrades capacity expansion new product introductions innovation and cost savings were 195 210 and 226 in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

proceeds from asset sales   proceeds from asset sales contributed 67 of cash in 2011  primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the op1 product family 

financing activities 

dividend payments    dividends paid per common share increased 247 to 106 per share in 2013  and increased 181  to 085  per share in 2012 as a result of the annual increase in dividends paid per share total dividend payments to common shareholders were 401 324  and 279 in 2013 2012  and 2011  respectively 

 

shortterm and longterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 

in march 2013 we sold 600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2018 the 2018 notes and 400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2043 the 2043 notes the 2018 notes bear interest at 13 per year and mature in april 1 2018 the 2043 notes bear interest at 41 per year and mature on april 1 2043 we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions stock repurchases and other business opportunities 

total debt was 2764 and 1762 in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

share repurchases   the total use of cash for share repurchases was 317 108 and 622 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

liquidity 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3980 and 4285 at december 31 2013  and 2012 respectively and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 5678 and 6272 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs including settlements related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls from a variety of sources including cash from operations commercial paper and existing credit lines in the past we have also raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time in the future we have strong shortterm and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 

in august 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new 1000 unsecured revolving credit facility due august 2017 2012 facility the 2012 facility replaced the previously outstanding 1000 unsecured credit facility that would have become due in august 2013 the 2012 facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional 500 a 500 multicurrency sublimit with no sublimit for euro borrowings and a 100 letter of credit sublimit the 2012 facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 5 to 225 basis points and bears interest at libor as defined in the 2012 facility agreement plus an applicable margin ranging from 575 to 1275 basis points both of which are dependent on our credit ratings 

should additional funds be required we had approximately 1052 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at december 31 2013  including the 2012 facility 

at december 31 2013  approximately 78 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the united states these funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 

we continually evaluate our receivables particularly in spain portugal italy and greece the southern european region the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately 199 and 198 at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively including approximately 103 of sovereign 



receivables in both years we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the southern european region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region any nonsovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013  we have recorded charges to earnings totaling 790  representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls based on the information that has been received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately 790  to 1235  before thirdparty insurance recoveries the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made 

as further described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 175 of which approximately 174 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2013 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans 

as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013  we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of 204  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

 

our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible 



in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting under the purchase method our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment with the exception of certain trade names the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer and distributor relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark andor brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in certain of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we have adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value 



we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements 

we review our other longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in other information below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement 

 

experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results the company is currently selfinsured for product liabilityrelated claims and expenses  the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new accounting pronouncements 

no accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

other information 

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

we sell our products throughout the world as a result our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar european currencies in particular the euro swiss franc and the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we develop and manufacture products in the united states china france germany ireland puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 

we enter into designated and nondesignated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses for nondesignated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our consolidated statements of earnings for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31 2013  fair value by approximately 6  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange 



contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 

we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2013  the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders equity by 80  to 306  from 226  as of december 31 2012  

legal and regulatory matters 

in 2010 we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj related to the sales and marketing of the otisknee device the subpoena concerns allegations of violations of federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda we continue to discuss the settlement of this matter with the doj but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts we have recorded charges totaling 80  related to the above matter including 47  in the year ended december 31 2013 

in june 2012 we voluntarily recalled our rejuvenate and abg ii modularneck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products we notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting andor corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us as previously announced we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services including any necessary revision surgeries we continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs the ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us and the amount of thirdparty insurance recoveries based on the information that has been received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately 790  to 1235  before thirdparty insurance recoveries in the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded charges to earnings of 600  representing the excess of the 790  minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves no contingent gain for thirdparty insurance recoveries was recorded as of december 31 2013 as noted above the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against zimmer holdings inc zimmer alleging that a zimmer product infringed three of our patents in rulings issued in august and september 

 

2013 the trial judge upheld the february 2013 jury verdict in our favor issued a permanent injunction barring zimmer from making or selling infringing products and ordered zimmer to pay us at least 228  zimmer is appealing this ruling and the ultimate resolution of this matter may differ materially accordingly we have not recorded a contingent gain related to this matter 

for each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted accordingly it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses however the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in april 2011 lawsuits brought by hillrom company inc and affiliated entities hillrom against us were filed in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin and the united states district court for the southern district of indiana the wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the united states district court in indiana the suits allege infringement under united states patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions we have entered into an agreement settling the first lawsuit with terms as previously disclosed the second lawsuit involves nine  patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds the case has been stayed with respect to six  of the patents which are currently under reexamination by the united states patent office with respect to the three  remaining patents hillrom is appealing the trial courts grant of summary judgment in our favor and the ultimate resolution of this particular part of the suit may differ the ultimate resolution of the entire second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted however the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2010 we received a subpoena from the doj related to sales marketing and regulatory matters related to the stryker painpump we have received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation the investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the doj regarding this matter

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order a substantial amount of our neurovascular finished goods are currently sourced from boston scientific corporation the manufacture of these products will transfer to stryker during 2013 the dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered to be significant 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage as of december 31 2012 we own approximately 1687 united states patents and 3081 international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months 

competition 

in all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces 

the principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality service and reputation we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements with the exception of our neurotechnology products have been developed internally at research facilities located in manufacturing locations in the united states ireland puerto rico germany switzerland india and 



france we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of worldwide companysponsored research development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were 471  462 and 394 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 54  56 and 54 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the spending level in 2012 as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the termination of all development of the op1 molecule in late 2011 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products many of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval pma applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products in addition we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in which we market our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

in addition business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

employees 

at december 31 2012 we had approximately 22010 employees worldwide certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide

risk factors 

tableend

this report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the reform act are based on current projections about operations industry conditions financial condition and liquidity words that identify forwardlooking statements include words such as may could will should possible plan predict forecast potential anticipate estimate expect project intend believe may impact on track and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance an acquisition or our businesses in addition any statements that refer to expectations projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include those risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

legal  regulatory risks 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain in 2010 federal legislation to reform the united states healthcare system was enacted into law the law was upheld by a supreme court decision that was announced on june 28 2012 the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage improve quality and reduce costs over time we expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations among other things the new law imposes a 23 percent excise tax on class i ii and iii medical devices beginning january 2013 that will apply to united states sales of a majority of our medical device products other provisions of this legislation including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered further we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the united states or internationally or whether any changes will lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes 

cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures   could have a negative impact on our future operating results initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements we are defendants in various proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including product liability and other matters these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters we purchase thirdparty insurance coverage subject to certain retentions deductibles and loss limitations we may be adversely impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried or for which coverage is otherwise not available in addition even if covered by insurance such losses may negatively impact our ability to obtain thirdparty insurance coverage in future periods on a cost effective basis or at all 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category 



dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios our   longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain   adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may   lose access to technologies critical to our products also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued   patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products timely if at all in addition if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters monetary fines product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing and criminal prosecution 

market risks 

macroeconomic developments such as the recent recessions in europe and the debt crises in certain countries in the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies   the continuing debt crises in certain european union countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european union customers financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars cross border transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects in addition our sales are translated into united states dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar could result in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

business and operational risks 

we may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors competitive factors include price customer service technology innovation quality reputation and reliability our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources than us or may be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry 

competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and new products   and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become   obsolete if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by   management a higher level of inventory write downs may result 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could decrease 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the united states trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements extraterritorial effects of united states laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability 



we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions in addition to internally developed products we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions investments in medical technology are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us these risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated diversion of managements time which could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so which may result in unexpected impairment charges 

we may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in evaluating the potential 

for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections growth rates cash flows tax rates and discount rates these assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations 

failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business we rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate timely we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth net earnings and diluted net earnings per share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

results of operations 

our consolidated results of operations were 

our geographic and segment net sales were 

net sales increased 42  in 2012 after increasing 135 in 2011 in 2012 net sales grew by 56 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 12 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 14 due to changes in price and 12 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales in constant currency net sales in 2012 increased by 54  in 2011 net sales grew by 61 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 24 due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 68 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 18 due to changes in price in constant currency net sales in 2011 increased by 111 

the increase in consolidated net sales for 2012 was primarily due to higher shipments of neurotechnology instruments trauma and extremities spine and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices these gains were partially offset by slowness in the european markets the increase in consolidated net sales for 2011 was primarily due to sales growth through acquisitions higher united states shipments of medsurg products and higher international shipments of medsurg products and neurotechnology and spine products in the united states net sales increased 74  in 2012 after increasing 99  in 2011 in constant currency international sales increased 19  in 2012 compared to 134  in 2011 

the following geographical sales growth information by segment is provided to supplement the net sales information presented above 

reconstructive net sales in 2012 increased 31  from 2011 primarily due to a 56 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 09 due to acquisitions net sales were negatively impacted by 22 due to changes in price and 13 due to the 



unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales in constant currency reconstructive net sales increased by 44  in 2012 primarily due to increases in trauma and extremities and market share gains in part as a result of a competitors product recall offset in part by slowness in the european markets reconstructive net sales in 2011 increased 45  from 2010 primarily due to a 34 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix a 30 favorable foreign currency impact and 08 due to acquisitions the increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand in addition net sales were negatively impacted by 28 due to changes in price in constant currency reconstructive net sales increased by 15  in 2011 

medsurg net sales in 2012 increased 33  from 2011 primarily due to a 41 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 01 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 01 due to changes in price and 09 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales in constant currency medsurg net sales in 2012 increased 42  led by higher shipments of instruments and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices these higher shipments were partially offset by challenging global market conditions for capital equipment medsurg net sales in 2011 increased 127  from 2010 led by medical while endoscopy and instruments also increased primarily due to a 95 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix 16 due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 19 due to acquisitions the effect of pricing on net sales was not significant in constant currency medsurg net sales increased by 112  in 2011 

neurotechnology and spine net sales in 2012 increased 92  from 2011 primarily due to an 85 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 42 due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 22 due to changes in price and 13 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales in constant currency neurotechnology and spine net sales in 2012 increased 105  neurotechnology and spine net sales in 2011 increased 485 from 2010 primarily due to the acquisition of neurovascular sales growth from acquisitions was 426 the remainder of the increase included 63 due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and 20 due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and the negative impact of changes in price of 25 in constant currency neurotechnology and spine net sales in 2011 increased by 464 

consolidated cost of sales 

cost of sales decreased 11  from 2011 to 321  of sales compared to 338 in 2011 cost of sales in 2012 and 2011 includes an additional cost of 18 and 143 respectively related to inventory that was stepped up to fair value following acquisitions cost of sales for 2012 also included 5 in other restructuring related costs aside from these factors the decrease in the cost of sales percentage in 2012 was primarily due to efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution network a favorable product mix and a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our eurobased manufacturing operations cost of sales in 2011 increased 230 from 2010 to 338 of sales compared to 312 in 2010 the increase in the cost of sales percentage in 2011 was primarily due to the impact of inventory step up and lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker united states dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses represented 54  of sales compared to 56 in 2011 and 54 in 2010 the spending level in 2012 decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the termination of all development of the op1 molecule in late 2011 the higher spending level in 2011 compared to 2010 was the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 100  and represented 400  of sales compared to 379  in 2011 and 370  in 2010 in 2012 we recorded 37 in acquisition and integrationrelated charges compared to 66 in 2011 in addition general and administrative costs in 2012 included 174 related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our rejuvenate and abg ii modularneck hip stems 33 offered to the doj to settle the subpoena received in 2010 related to the sales and marketing of the otisknee device and 8 in separation costs associated with our former chief executive officer in 2011 general and administrative expenses included the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue in 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in france and recorded a gain of 24 that is included in general and administrative expenses

other income expense 

other expense in 2012 increased 36  from 2011 after decreasing 22 from 2010 the increase in expense in 2012 from 2011 and the reduction in expense from 2010 to 2011 are primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense in 2011 resulting from settlements 



reached with the united states internal revenue service irs in 2011 we reached a favorable settlement regarding an irs proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to the income tax positions we had taken for our irish cost sharing arrangements we also reached a settlement with the irs with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in puerto rico for the years 2006 through 2009 the higher interest expense in 2012 due to the effect of the 2011 tax settlements was partially offset by higher interest income on our investments due to higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to 2011

our effective income tax rate on earnings was 239  202  and 264  in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two german subsidiaries and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed the effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlements with the irs as described above the effective income tax rate for 2010 includes the impact of a property plant and equipment impairment charge the gain on sale of a manufacturing facility and the favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the united states completed in 2009

financial condition and liquidity 

operating activities 

operating cash flow was 1657  in 2012 an increase of 156  from 2011 operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable consumed 50  of operating cash flow in 2012 inventory contributed 18  of operating cash flow as inventory days on hand decreased by 5 days due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management accounts receivable used 20  primarily to support business growth while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days due to timing of sales 

operating cash flow was 1434 in 2011 a decrease of 73 from 2010 operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for noncash items depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation sale of inventory stepped up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes the net of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable consumed 274 of operating cash flow in 2011 inventory consumed 166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above accounts receivable used 143 primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased by 2 days due to timing of sales 

investing activities 

net investing activities consumed 736  of cash in 2012 and 2135 in 2011 primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending 

acquisitions   acquisitions used 154  of cash in 2012 and 2066 in 2011 cash used in 2012 was primarily for the acquisition of surpass medical for 99 as well as for milestone payments associated with previous acquisitions cash used in 2011 was primarily for the acquisitions of neurovascular for 1450 orthovita for 316 memometal for 150 and concentric for 135 

capital spending   we manage capital spending to support our business growth capital expenditures primarily to support integration of acquisitions capacity expansion new product introductions innovation and cost savings were 210  in 2012 and 226 in 2011 

proceeds from asset sales   proceeds from asset sales contributed 67 to cash in 2011 primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the op1 product family 

financing activities 

dividend payments   dividends paid per common share increased 181  to 085  per share in 2012 total dividend payments to common shareholders were 324  in 2012 and 279 in 2011 the increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from 018 per share in 2011 to 02125 per share in 2012 

longterm and shortterm debt   we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash flow expectations cash requirements for ongoing operations investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 

in september 2011 we sold 750 of unsecured notes due september 2016 the net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions stock repurchases and other business opportunities total debt was 1762  in 2012 and 1768 in 2011 

share repurchases   the total use of cash for share repurchases was 108  in 2012 and 622 in 2011 

liquidity 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4285  at december 31 2012 and 3418 at december 31 2011 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 6272  at december 31 2012 and 5367 at december 31 2011 we anticipate being able to support our shortterm liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations we have also raised funds in the past in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time we have strong short and longterm debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 

in august 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new 1000 unsecured revolving credit facility due august 2017 2012 facility the 2012 facility replaced the previously outstanding 1000 unsecured credit facility that would have become due in august 2013 the 2012 facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional 500 a 500 multicurrency sublimit with no sublimit for euro borrowings and a 100 letter of credit sublimit the 2012 facility has an 



annual facility fee ranging from 5 to 225 basis points and bears interest at libor as defined in the 2012 facility agreement plus an applicable margin ranging from 575 to 1275 basis points both of which are dependent on our credit ratings 

should additional funds be required we had approximately 1063 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at december 31 2012  including the 2012 facility in february of 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire trauson holdings company limited a leading manufacturer of trauma and spine products in china in connection with this offer we have restricted 800 of our available borrowing capacity until the completion of the tender offer the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013 

at december 31 2012  approximately 60 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the united states these funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 

several european countries including spain portugal italy and greece the southern european region have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal conditions we continuously monitor our investment portfolio for exposures to the european debt crisis we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region any nonsovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial 

we continually evaluate our receivables particularly in the southern european region the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately 198 and 257 at december 31 2012  and 2011 respectively including approximately 103 and 170 respectively of sovereign receivables we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the european debt crisis is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2012 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 193  of which approximately 183 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods beyond 2013 in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made 

as further described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2012 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of 227  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 



allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are recorded in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles and longlived assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting under the purchase method our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are 



based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark andor brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 

in certain of our acquisitions we acquire inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets iprd is considered to be an indefinitelived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinablelived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 

the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we have adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value 

we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

we did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements 

we review longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale if any are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various ongoing proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in other information below and in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and 



equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable loss or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters we purchase thirdparty insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried in addition such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective thirdparty insurance coverage in future periods 

new accounting pronouncements 

no accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

other information 

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

we sell our products throughout the world as a result our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar european currencies in particular the euro swiss franc and the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we develop and manufacture products in the united states china france germany ireland puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 

we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses included in our consolidated statements of earnings 

the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31 2012 fair value by approximately 10 we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 

we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2012 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders equity by 50  to 226  from 176 as of december 31 2011 

legal and regulatory matters 

on june 28 2012 we voluntarily recalled our rejuvenate and abg ii modularneck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products we notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting andor corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us as previously announced we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services including any necessary revision surgeries we continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs the ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the limited information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us and the amount of thirdparty insurance recoveries based on the information that has been received we estimate the probable loss to resolve this matter to be in the range of approximately 190 to 390 before thirdparty insurance recoveries accordingly in december 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of 174 representing the excess of the 190 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves no contingent gain 



for thirdparty recoveries was recorded as of december 31 2012 as noted above the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2010 we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj related to the sales and marketing of the otisknee device the subpoena concerns allegations of violations of federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda we entered into discussions with the doj regarding the potential resolution of this matter and in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded a nontax deductible charge of 33 for this matter we continue to discuss this matter with the doj but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts while we believe we have strong arguments to defend against these allegations if our defense is ultimately unsuccessful we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the total cost to resolve this matter may be approximately two times greater than the amount we have accrued the final outcome of this matter is difficult to predict and the ultimate cost to resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2010 a shareholders derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former directors and officers was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan southern division this lawsuit was brought by the westchester putnam counties heavy and highway laborers local 60 benefit funds and laborers local 235 benefit funds the complaint alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls fda warning letters government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our biotech division we recently entered into a settlement agreement that requires changes to certain of strykers corporate governance practices 

for each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted accordingly it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses however the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in april 2011 lawsuits brought by hillrom company inc and affiliated entities hillrom against us were filed in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin and the united states district court for the southern district of indiana the wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the united states district court in indiana the suits allege infringement under united states patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions the first lawsuit involved ten patents related to the use of a motorized wheel for hospital beds and stretchers we recently entered into an agreement settling that lawsuit this agreement included a payment to hillrom of 375 a covenant not to sue and a crosslicense the second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds the case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents which are currently under reexamination by the united states patent office with respect to the suit and the three remaining patents we continue to vigorously defend ourselves the ultimate resolution of the second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted however the ultimate cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2010 we received a subpoena from the doj related to sales marketing and regulatory matters related to the stryker painpump we recently received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation the investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the doj regarding this matter 

in 2007 we disclosed that the united states securities and exchange commission sec made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries subsequently in 2008 we received a subpoena from the united states doj criminal division requesting certain documents for the period since january 1 2000 in connection with the sec inquiry we are fully cooperating with the doj and the sec regarding these matters 

in 2007 the united states department of health and human services office of inspector general hhs issued us a civil subpoena seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use strykers orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by medicare we have produced numerous documents and other materials to hhs in response to the subpoena

raw materials and inventory 

raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory while certain medsurg products are assembled to order the dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered to be significant 

patents and trademarks 

patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features we seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage as of december 31 2011 we own approximately 1456 united states patents and 2579 international patents 

seasonality 

our business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months 

competition 

in all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved the development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces 

the principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality service and reputation we believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products 

product development 

most of our products and product improvements with the exception of our neurotechnology products have been developed internally at research facilities located in manufacturing locations in the united states ireland puerto rico germany switzerland and france we also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate we maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts the total costs of worldwide companysponsored research development and engineering activities 



relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were 462 394 and 336 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively research development and engineering expenses represented 56 of sales 54 of sales and 50 of sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

regulation 

most of our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 

in the united states the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act of 1990 and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the federal food and drug administration fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of our products most of our new products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k certain of our products require extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by premarket approval applications for specific surgical indications 

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products we have previously been subject to warning letters issued by the fda but all warning letters have been resolved as of may 10 2010 and none are currently outstanding 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain ce marking for their products we have authorization to apply the ce marking to substantially all of our products 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such costcontainment measures on our future business 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 21241 employees worldwide certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide

circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements include those risks discussed below 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we may be unable to effectively develop and market products against those of our competitors in a highly competitive industry our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors competitive factors include price customer service technology innovation quality reputation and reliability our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies undertake more extensive marketing campaigns have greater financial marketing and other resources than us or may be more successful in attracting potential customers employees and strategic partners given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry 

competition in research involving development and the improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and new products   and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become   obsolete if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by   management a higher level of inventory writedowns may result 

dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may result in our payment of significant monetary damages or impact offerings in our product portfolios our   longterm success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products if we fail to obtain or maintain   adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may   lose access to technologies critical to our products also our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued   patents and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority scope and other issues 

intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and from time to time we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation regardless of outcome such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing labeling and marketing of our products substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the united states the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all in addition if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters monetary fines product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing and criminal prosecution 

healthcare changes in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures   could have a negative impact on our future operating results initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are ongoing in markets where we do business pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among health care providers trends toward managed care the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other costcontainment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results 

the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain in 2010 federal legislation to reform the united states healthcare system was enacted into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage improve quality and reduce costs over time we expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations however it is unclear how the new law will impact patient access to new technologies or reimbursement rates under the medicare program in addition the new law imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices scheduled to be implemented in 2013 that will apply to united states sales of a majority of our medical device products many of the details of the new law will be included in new and revised regulations which have not yet been promulgated and require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the department of health and human services department of labor and department of the treasury accordingly while it is too early to understand and predict the ultimate impact of the new law on our business the 



legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements we are defendants in various proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including product liability and other matters these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable in addition we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters we purchase thirdparty insurance coverage subject to certain retentions deductibles and loss limitations while we believe our current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such matters we may be adversely impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried or for which coverage is otherwise not available in addition even if covered by insurance such losses may negatively impact our ability to obtain thirdparty insurance coverage in future periods on a costeffective basis or at all 

we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines if we are unable to maintain these relationships our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably affected 

we are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations we develop manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world our international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements differing local product preferences and product requirements diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the united states trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements extraterritorial effects of united states laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability 

exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars could have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations which are presented in united states dollars    cross border transactions both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates could negatively affect our results of operations in addition our sales are translated into united states dollars for reporting purposes the strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar could result in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into united states dollars 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our income tax expense and net earnings 

we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions in addition to internally developed products we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions investments in medical technology are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us these risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated diversion of managements time which could adversely affect managements ability to focus on other projects the inability to realize the expected benefits savings or synergies from the acquisition the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so which may result in unexpected impairment charges 

failure of a key information technology system process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business we rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our business cash flows financial conditions or results of operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the 



development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives 

macroeconomic developments such as the recent recessions in europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies   the continuing debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european customers financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management uses these nongaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these nongaap financial measures to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth net earnings and diluted net earnings per share the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

the following geographical sales growth information by segment is provided to supplement the net sales information presented above 







reconstructive net sales in 2011 increased 45 from 2010 primarily due to a 34 increase in unit volume and changes in product mix the increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand in addition net sales were negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact of changes in price which were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency in constant currency reconstructive net sales increased by 15 in 2011 reconstructive net sales for 2010 increased 49 from 2009 primarily due to increases in unit volumes for hips knees and trauma and extremities products due to higher worldwide industry demand in constant currency reconstructive net sales increased by 35 in 2010

orthovita memometal and concentric the remaining increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales and the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker united states dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations cost of sales in 2010 decreased 47 from 2009 to 312 of sales compared to 325 in 2009 the decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our eurobased manufacturing sites 

research development and engineering expenses

as further described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2011 our defined benefit pension plans were in an underfunded status of 106 of which approximately 94 related to plans outside the united states due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods beyond 2012 in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2011 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of 249 due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 

our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves income taxes acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets and legal and other contingencies we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

inventory reserves 

we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 

deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 

inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate 



jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments in certain of these jurisdictions we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits and adjust them accordingly we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 

acquisitions goodwill and intangibles 

we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting under the purchase method our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition in addition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists for significant items the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands other acquired intangible assets eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives our assessment as to trademarks and brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share trademark andor brand history underlying product life cycles operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors all of our acquired technology and customerrelated intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives 

the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life the value of indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year we have earlyadopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill 

in certain circumstances we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we test individual indefinitelived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur indefinitelived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed 



we did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset fair values exceeded their respective recorded values however future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year the recorded value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 

we review longlived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level as defined undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved in various proceedings legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business including proceedings related to product labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time in certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements andor the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations a liability representing managements best estimate of the probable cost or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel previous settlement experience and settlement strategies if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management additional expense may be incurred which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters we purchase thirdparty insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried in addition such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain costeffective thirdparty insurance coverage in future periods 

new accounting pronouncements 

no new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

other information 

hedging and derivative financial instruments 

we distribute our products throughout the world as a result our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar european currencies in particular the euro swiss franc and the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we develop and manufacture products in the united states china france germany ireland puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 

we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31 2011 fair value by approximately 48 we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by 



counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 

we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2011 the strengthening of united states dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by 20 to 176 from 196 at december 31 2010

the company’s backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding of its business 

orthopaedic implants 

orthopaedic implants consist of such products as implants used in joint replacement trauma craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries bone cement and the bone growth factor op1 artificial joints are made of cobalt chromium titanium alloys ceramics or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by arthritis osteoporosis other diseases or injury many of stryker’s technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to minimally invasive surgery mis procedures that are intended to reduce softtissue damage and pain while hastening return to function the company supports surgeons with technology procedural development and specialized instrumentation as they develop new mis techniques 

hip implant systems 

the company offers a variety of hip implant systems for the global reconstructive market total hip replacement surgeries involve the replacement of both the head of the femur as well as the acetabulum socket of the pelvis stryker offers hip replacement products to address first time primary hip surgeries as well as revision systems the abg hip system partnership hip system securfit hip system omnifit hip system accolade hip system centpillar hip system trident acetabular hip system adm mobile bearing hip system rejuvenate modular primary hip system cormet hip resurfacing system and restoration hip system are all comprehensive systems of hip implants and associated instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with reliable clinical results across the continuum of care while enhancing value and operating room efficiency for the hospital 

  

stryker is committed to following clinical outcomes and recognizes that longterm clinical results are an important factor in the company’s ability to market hip implants significant clinical milestones for the company include more than 40 years of clinical history with the exeter hip system more than 25 years of clinical history with the dallmiles cable system more than 20 years of clinical history with the omnifit ha stem and more than 10 years clinical history with the accolade tmzf hip system 

stryker was the first company to receive clearance from the us food and drug administration the fda to commercially release for sale in the united states a hip implant with hydroxylapatite ha surface treatment ha is a naturally occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of biocompatibility due to its resemblance to bone the company’s global clinical experience with hacoated hip stems now extends over 20 years and reported clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that of comparable hip stems reported in the scientific literature 

primary femoral hip systems 

in 2009 stryker introduced the rejuvenate modular primary hip system the latest evolution in the company’s omnifit and securfit hip systems the rejuvenate modular primary hip system offers surgeons unparalleled options for personalizing the implant to each patient’s anatomy the rejuvenate system is designed to optimize anatomic restoration by providing options that offer enhanced stability proven modularity and intraoperative flexibility the modular design enables the surgeon to independently manage stem size leg length and offset to recreate the patient’s anatomy restore biomechanics and consequently minimize the risk of dislocation 

the accolade tmzf hip system has demonstrated strong clinical results for more than 10 years with 2009 marking the first introduction of the product into japan the accolade tmzf system is a tapered wedge implant based on a broach only technique and is recognized for its simplicity and flexibility to accommodate all surgical approaches and navigation 

the abg ii modular hip system represents the next generation of design based on the abg monolithic stem that has had positive clinical experience for more than 10 years this modular primary hip stem provides the opportunity to recreate patient anatomy through independent sizing of the stem and neck versatile instrumentation also accommodates surgeon preference for a navigated procedure or direct anterior surgical approach 

the company’s exeter total hip system is based on a collarless highly polished doubletapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and increases compression at the cementbone interface 

primary acetabular systems 

the company’s advanced bearing system low friction ion treatment lfit anatomic femoral heads with x3 polyethylene liners represents a significant advance in hipbearing technology through the combination of stryker’s lfit technology and x3 advanced bearing technology the femoral heads are anatomically sized for more natural hip performance in 2010 the company introduced the adm x3 mobile bearing acetabular system a nextgeneration technology for hip replacement surgery designed to minimize the risk associated with total hip replacement surgery by offering a large diameter bearing without a metalonmetal articulation x3 advanced bearing technology is based on the company’s highly crosslinked polyethylene which demonstrates enhanced material characteristics in laboratory testing including improved strength reduced wear and oxidation resistance this second generation bearing option offers a significant technological advance for both hip and knee replacements the company also offers the biolox delta ceramic anatomic head for further options to reduce wear and potentially increase implant longevity 

  

the company has a premarket approval pma from the fda for its ceramiconceramic hip replacement system the trident ceramic acetabular insert for patients in the united states stryker orthopaedics has successfully launched the trident ceramic insert in the united states europe australia and canada the trident insert has demonstrated low wear clinically and it is protected and strengthened by a patented titanium sleeve

the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing product royalty and foreign branch arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 

legal and other contingencies

to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters the company purchases thirdparty insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried in addition such matters may negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain costeffective thirdparty insurance coverage in future periods

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as in 2010 nonfunctional cash balances associated with the anticipated acquisition of the neurovascular division from boston scientific and in 2009 intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

at december 31 2010 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 10119 million and sell 3669 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from 7 to 99 days at december 31 2009 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange 

  

contracts to purchase 20411 million and sell 2805 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would change the december 31 2010 fair value by approximately 639 million the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2010 the strengthening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders’ equity by 810 million to 1965 million from 2775 million at december 31 2009 

in the third quarter of 2010 the company received separate subpoenas from the us department of justice related to i the sales marketing and regulatory matters related to the stryker painpump and ii sales marketing and regulatory matters related to the otisknee device the company is in the process of responding to these subpoenas

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

inventory reserves 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis these marketplace changes may cause some of the company’s products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 

income taxes 

the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in 2009 the company adopted the provisions of the business combinations topic of the fasb codification  this topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed this topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination the additional disclosure requirements regarding the business combinations topic of the fasb codification are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2008 the company adopted the provisions of the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the fasb codification for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis this topic applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this topic the additional disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in 2009 the company adopted the nonfinancial assets and liabilities guidance of the fair value measurement and disclosures topic that were previously deferred 

in 2008 the company adopted the provisions of the financial instruments topic of the fasb codification  this topic allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value such election which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis is typically irrevocable once elected the company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ars rights agreement as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources  

  

other matters

the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2009 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders’ equity by 738 million to 2775 million from 2037 million at december 31 2008

income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

related costs partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending

 

in 2007 the company recorded a 198 million charge 127 million net of income taxes to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products the impairment followed a us food and drug administration fda decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to class ii devices along with a weak market for sales of these specific products as a result the company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required

the purchased inprocess research and development charge of 527 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of sightline at the date of the acquisition the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility the upfront payment of 500 million plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities was allocated to assets acquired purchased inprocess research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the amount written off as purchased inprocess research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the united states 

the company believes that the technologies acquired in the sightline acquisition will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales however unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a products development prior to commercialization which could have an unfavorable impact on the companys operating results as of december 31 2007 the company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008 

  interest and marketable securities income which is included in other income expense increased to 855 million in 2007 from 414 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006 interest expense which is included in other income expense increased to 222 million in 2007 from 95 million in 2006 primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions

upon adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 the company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with unresolved income tax positions which was accounted for by reducing the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings by 76 million net of income taxes in addition the company reclassified 1792 million from the current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of future income tax payments 

net earnings from continuing operations increased 28 in 2007 to 9867 million from 7714 million in 2006 basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 in 2007 to 241 from 190 in 2006 and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 in 2007 to 237 from 187 in 2006

the purchased inprocess research and development charge of 527 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of sightline the purchased inprocess research and development charge of 159 million recorded in 2005 relates to the acquisition of plasmasol at the date of the plasmasol acquisition the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the fda and therefore had not yet reached technological feasibility the purchase price of 175 million was allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased inprocess research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition the amounts written off as purchased inprocess research and development were not deductible for income tax purposes in the united states 

the company believes that the technologies acquired in both the sightline and plasmasol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales however unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a products development prior to regulatory approval or commercialization which could have an unfavorable impact on the companys operating results as previously described as of december 31 2007 the company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008 as of december 31 2007 the company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the sterilization technologies in 2010 

  interest and marketable securities income which is included in other income expense increased to 414 million in 2006 from 133 million in 2005 primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2006 compared to 2005 interest expense which is included in other income expense increased to 95 million in 2006 from 77 million in 2005 primarily as a result of borrowings in europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005

the companys effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2006 was 295 as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 of 325 the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased inprocess research and development charge associated with the acquisition of sightline the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased inprocess research and development charge associated with the acquisition of plasmasol as well as the additional 274 million of income taxes recorded as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings after considering these factors the companys reported effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 are lower than the us statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax international jurisdictions

net earnings from continuing operations increased 22 in 2006 to 7714 million from 6325 million in 2005 basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21 in 2006 to 190 from 157 in 2005 and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21 in 2006 to 187 from 154 in 2005 

excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased inprocess research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 22 in 2006 to 8241 million from 6758 million in 2005 adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22 in 2006 to 203 from 167 in 2005 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21 in 2006 to 200 from 165 in 2005 

the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures are as follows in millions except per share amounts

   

  the weightedaverage basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these nongaap financial measures are the same as the weightedaverage shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  the companys working capital at december 31 2007 increased 13891 million to 35719 million from 21828 million at december 31 2006 the increase in working capital resulted from growth in the companys overall business the proceeds from the sale of physiotherapy associates and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable inventories and prepaid expenses accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at both december 31 2007 and 2006 and days sales in inventory decreased one day to 137 days at december 31 2007 from 138 days at december 31 2006

  the company generated cash of 10283 million from operations in 2007 compared with 8673 million in 2006 the increase in cash from operations in 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by growth in the working capital accounts primarily accounts receivable and inventories

  in 2007 the company borrowed an additional 1037 million and used cash of 1029 million for payments on borrowings the company also used cash of 1877 million for capital expenditures including 143 million related to the implementation of erp systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities 139 million for facility expansions and 70 million to complete the construction of the homer stryker center for education and clinical research in mahwah new jersey in addition the company used 548 million for acquisitions and 897 million for the payment of dividends the company also purchased and sold marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale investments in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  

  the company had 2905 million in cash and cash equivalents and 21203 million in marketable securities at december 31 2007 the company also had outstanding borrowings totaling 168 million at that date all of which were classified as current obligations the company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches required debt repayments and the payment of dividends 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 9 of the companys investments in availableforsale securities were held in triple a rated per standard  poors assetbacked debt securities of which the majority related to investments in automobile loans at december 31 2007 less than 1 of the companys investments in marketable securities were exposed to a risk of loss related to the declining value of the subprimemortgage securities market

  should additional funds be required the company had 10473 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities including the companys 10000 million 5year nonamortizing revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in november 2010 in addition the company had the entire 2000 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at december 31 2007

the companys additional borrowing capacity along with the expected expiration period of the commitments is summarized as follows in millions

 

 critical accounting policies   

  the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results

inventory reserves 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters

 

 39 

  

to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

 

 

other matters   

 

the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the us dollar the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases when the us dollar strengthens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

  the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings

  at december 31 2007 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 4279 million and sell 2577 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 4 to 101 days at december 31 2006 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 3879 million and sell 2270 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would change the december 31 2007 fair value by approximately 74 million the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 

  the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2007 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity by 1527 million to 2723 million from 1196 million at december 31 2006

 

the company is partially selfinsured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its selfinsured retention limits the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events

  

  in 2003 the company announced that it received a subpoena from the us attorneys office for the district of massachusetts in connection with a us department of justice investigation of physiotherapy associates billing and coding practices under the terms of the physiotherapy sale agreement stryker retained responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with this investigation the companys liability for such damages was fixed under the sale agreement with interest to be accrued through the date of payment which occurred in 2007 liabilities previously recorded by the company were sufficient to cover these obligations

 

 40 

 

  in 2007 the company disclosed that the us securities and exchange commission has made an informal inquiry of the company regarding possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries subsequently in 2008 the company received a subpoena from the us department of justice criminal division requesting certain documents for the period january 1 2000 through the present in connection with the us securities and exchange commission inquiry in 2006 the company announced that it received a subpoena from the us department of justice antitrust division requesting documents for the period january 2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law including possible violation of the antitrust laws relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices the company is fully cooperating with the us department of justice and the us securities and exchange commission regarding these matters

 

  in 2007 the company received two warning letters from the fda regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities one letter for its facility in cork ireland and another for its facility in mahwah new jersey the company takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the fda to address their observations

the companys backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding of its business

orthopaedic implants 

orthopaedic implants are designed and manufactured by stryker orthopaedics stryker osteosynthesis stryker spine and stryker biotech and consist of such products as implants used in joint replacement trauma craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries bone cement and the bone growth factor op1 artificial joints are made of cobalt chromium titanium alloys ceramics or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by arthritis osteoporosis other diseases or injury the companys op1 bone growth factor which induces the formation of new bone when implanted into bone is composed of recombinant human op1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix   

minimally invasive surgery 

 

many of strykers technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to minimally invasive surgery mis procedures that are intended to reduce softtissue damage and pain while hastening return to function the company supports surgeons with technology procedural development and specialized instrumentation as they develop new mis techniques 

in 2006 the company began the initial launch of a hip resurfacing product in certain international markets this product represents a less invasive option for younger patients with the potential for enhanced stability and range of motion in hip resurfacing procedures very little bone is removed from the femoral head the femoral neck is preserved and the femoral canal is spared 

in order to facilitate emerging procedural approaches the company has also developed instrumentation for mis total hip arthroplasty the companys surgical navigation systems are frequently used in mis procedures to improve the accuracy of measurements and to position the implant

 6 

stryker osteosynthesis has a market leadership position in the intramedullary im hip screw market due to the minimally invasive nature of the gamma nail in 2004 stryker launched a new version of the gamma nail that can be implanted through an even smaller incision in addition surgeons are testing the use of the companys surgical navigation systems for this procedure as well as in surgery for pelvic fractures

the companys scorpio total knee minimally invasive instrumentation is designed to complement the unique minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by a leading orthopaedic surgeon this technique can reduce the length of the incision by approximately 70 because of the companys commitment to responsible science a multicenter study was conducted to validate the techniques reproducibility and potential benefits such as reduced pain and earlier return to function 

the eius unicondylar knee and the avon patellofemoral joint are resurfacing boneconserving designs that are used to treat disease isolated to one compartment of the knee these pretotal knee treatment options can also be implanted using minimally invasive techniques

the company believes that the technologies acquired in both the sightline and plasmasol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales however factors including regulatory delays safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these potential new products additionally unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a products development prior to regulatory approval the company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper fda approval as of december 31 2006 the company has not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies and the sterilization technologies in 2007 and 2008 respectively

cost of sales represented 353 of sales in 2005 compared with 355 in 2004 the lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the companys products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin medsurg equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth

  research development and engineering expenses represented 58 of sales in 2005 compared with 50 in 2004 these expenses increased 32 in 2005 to 2847 million the higher spending level is the result of the companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies together with beginning in the third quarter of 2004 spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from spinecore new product introductions in 2005 in the orthopaedic implants segment included x3 polyethylene the companys nextgeneration highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements and the

  selling general and administrative expenses increased 10 in 2005 and represented 380 of sales compared with 395 in 2004 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the companys growth in net sales these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14 growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets

critical accounting policies 

  

  the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable writeoffs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results

 

inventory reserves 

 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

 

income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters these income tax accruals are included 

 

 37 

 

within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

 

 

other matters 

  

  the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases when the united states dollar strengthens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

  the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies all forward currency exchange contracts are markedtomarket each period with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings

  at december 31 2006 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 3879 million and sell 2270 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days at december 31 2005 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 2176 million and sell 1961 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar would change the december 31 2006 fair value by approximately 97 million the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

  the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity for the year ended december 31 2006 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity by 1026 million to 1196 million from 170 million at december 31 2005

the company is partially selfinsured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its selfinsured retention limits the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events

  in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements the interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of tax positions interest and penalties and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis the company plans to adopt the provisions of the interpretation effective january 1 2007 as required the company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of the interpretation will have on the financial position of the company but does not anticipate a material impact any difference between the amounts recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of the interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of retained earnings on january 1 2007 and will not require restatement of prior periods

cost of sales represented 352 of sales in 2005 compared with 354 in 2004 the lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the companys products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin medsurg equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth

  research development and engineering expenses represented 57 of sales in 2005 compared with 50 in 2004 these expenses increased 33 in 2005 to 2798 million the higher spending level is the result of the companys continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies together with beginning in the third quarter of 2004 spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from spinecore new product introductions in 2005 in the orthopaedic implants segment included x3 polyethylene the companys nextgeneration highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements and the posteriorstabilized version of the triathlon knee system in the united states europe canada and the pacific region within the medsurg equipment segment new product introductions in 2005 included the maestro drill which expanded the companys line of micro powered instruments for spine neurology and ear nose and throat applications 

 

 

  selling general and administrative expenses increased 10 in 2005 and represented 372 of sales compared with 388 in 2004 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the companys growth in net sales these decreases are partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14 growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets

  the company generated cash of 8638 million from operations in 2005 compared with 5933 million in 2004 the increase in cash from operations in 2005 compared with the prior year is primarily due to higher net earnings in 2005 and the elimination of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of 1500 million in 2004 along with the improvements in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory

 the companys additional borrowing capacity along with the expected expiration period of the commitments is summarized as follows in millions

 critical accounting policies   

  the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable writeoffs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results

inventory reserves 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive with new products and surgical procedures being introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

 

 

income taxes   the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters these income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

other matters   

  the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases when the united states dollar strengthens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

  the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies

  at december 31 2005 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 1316 million and sell 921 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the december 31 2005 fair value by approximately 02 million the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

  the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity for the year ended december 31 2005 the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related deferred gain in shareholders equity by 1929 million to 170 million

the company is partially selfinsured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its selfinsured retention limits the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events

the company is one of four leading competitors in the united states for orthopaedic reconstructive products the three other leading competitors are depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson zimmer holdings inc and biomet inc while competition abroad varies from area to area the company believes it is also a leading player in the international markets with these same companies as its principal competitors

 

in the trauma implant segment stryker is one of five leaders competing principally with synthesstratec smith  nephew orthopaedics a division of smith  nephew plc zimmer holdings inc and depuy orthopaedics inc

 

in the spinal implant segment the company is one of four leaders including the principal competitors medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy spine inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson and synthesstratec

 

in the craniomaxillofacial segment stryker is one of four leaders together with the principal competitors synthesstratec walter lorenz surgical inc a subsidiary of biomet inc and kls martin lp 

 

the company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of hard and soft tissues that would compete with the companys op1 product medtronic sofamor danek has received fda approval for its recombinant bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp2 for certain spine trauma and orthopaedic indications including the treatment of acute open fractures of the tibial shaft and spinal fusion surgeries a number of companies currently provide various other therapies including allografts bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue the company believes that its op1 product which is approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical trials for other indications would ultimately compete with these products and with traditional therapies such as autograft and allograft

 

in the powered surgical instruments segment stryker is one of three leaders together with the principal domestic competitors medtronic midas rex inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc and linvatec inc a subsidiary of conmed corporation these companies are also competitors in the international segments along with aesculapwerke ag a division of b braun melsungen ag a large european manufacturer

research development and engineering expenses represented 50 of sales in 2003 compared with 47 in 2002 the higher spending level was the result of final development spending in advance of the companys product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches new product introductions in 2003 included the trident ceramic acetabular system simplex p with tobramycin bone cement and the core platform of micropowered surgical instruments in the united states market and the system 5 heavyduty batterypowered surgical instruments in europe

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 22 in 2003 and represented 391 of sales compared with 387 in 2002 the 22 increase in selling general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20 increase in net sales in 2003 in addition the company incurred a 140 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums charged by thirdparty insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in other matters  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 was primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of orthopaedic implants increased amortization of loaner instrument sets the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the companys previously announced patient education campaign

 

the increase in intangibles amortization to 454 million in 2003 from 289 million in 2002 was primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result of the july 1 2002 acquisition of the surgical dynamics inc spinal implant business sdi from tyco international ltd in addition the company recorded a 65 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of 2003 the branding initiative is intended to improve the companys customers and other stakeholders overall awareness of strykers capabilities the charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings

interest expense declined to 226 million in 2003 from 403 million in 2002 primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances other income was 38 million in 2003 compared with 05 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year and higher interest income

 

the effective income tax rate was 305 in 2003 compared with 318 in 2002 the companys effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as ireland and puerto rico

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the companys working capital at december 31 2004 increased 4659 million to 10291 million from 5632 million at december 31 2003 the increase in working capital resulted from growth in the companys overall business and the use of cash earnings to fully repay amounts outstanding under the companys accounts receivable securitization program and to fund increases in accounts receivable inventory prepaid expenses and loaner instrumentation for surgical implants accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2004 as a result of the growth in the business higher obligations for sales commissions royalties nonincomebased taxes increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities accounts receivable days sales outstanding excluding the effect of amounts outstanding 0 at december 31 2004 and 1500 million at december 31 2003 under the companys 2000 million accounts receivable securitization facility was 58 days at both december 31 2004 and 2003 days sales in inventory increased 2 days to 122 days at december 31 2004 from 120 days at december 31 2003 the higher days sales in inventory is partially due to increased inventories to support 2004 and anticipated 2005 product launches

 

the company generated cash of 5933 million from operations in 2004 compared with 6485 million in 2003 the reduction in cash from operations in 2004 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the repayment of all amounts previously outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of 1500 million in 2004 compared with an operating cash source of 200 million in 2003 the generation of cash of 5933 million in 2004 is the result of cash earnings and increases in accounts payable current income taxes payable and accrued expenses these items were partially offset by the aforementioned repayment of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility and increases in loaner instrumentation and accounts receivable from increased sales in 2004 the company used cash of 1447 million for acquisitions 1878 million for capital expenditures and 280 million for the payment of dividends during 2004 the company repaid the remaining 155 million of debt outstanding under the companys unsecured credit facility from the howmedica acquisition total borrowings declined by 161 million after adjusting for the effects of foreign currency translation

the company had 3494 million in cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 the company also had outstanding borrowings totaling 100 million at that date current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2004 are 93 million the company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures and future acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings should additional funds be required the company had 8260 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities including the companys 7500 million fiveyear nonamortizing revolving credit agreement that expires in december 2006 in addition the company had 2000 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2004

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the

circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable writeoffs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results

 

inventory reserves 

 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause some of the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

 

income taxes 

the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the company records accruals representing managements best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

 

 

other matters 

 

the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases when the united states dollar strengthens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

 

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate

to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies

 

at december 31 2004 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 1377 million and sell 1731 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the december 31 2004 fair value by approximately 61 million the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

  

the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity for the year ended december 31 2004 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related deferred gain in stockholders equity by 1022 million to 2099 million

 

the company is partially selfinsured for product liability claims in 2003 the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the united states to manage its selfinsured retention limits the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 

 

in december 2003 the company announced that its subsidiary physiotherapy associates inc and stryker received a subpoena from the united states attorneys office in boston massachusetts in connection with a department of justice investigation of physiotherapy associates billing and coding practices physiotherapy associates provides physical occupational and speech therapy services to patients through 428 outpatient centers in the united states as of december 31 2004 and represented 6 of strykers net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 revenues derived from billings to us federal healthcare programs approximated 14 of physiotherapy associates revenues during these periods the company is fully cooperating with the department of justice regarding this matter

 

on october 22 2004 the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act the act creates a temporary incentive for united states corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by providing an 85 dividendsreceived deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and significant uncertainty remains about the way to interpret numerous provisions in the act due to these factors the company is not yet in a position to determine whether and to what extent it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the united states based on its current analysis the company may repatriate up to 8000 million with a related income tax expense and liability of up to 560 million the company plans to finalize its assessment after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision

 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement no 123 sharebased payment  this revision supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance this revision requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grantdate fair value pursuant to their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options typically the vesting period pursuant to the requirements of the statement the company plans to adopt the provisions of the standard during the third quarter of 2005 using the modifiedretrospective transition method provided in the statement under this method the company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis the company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share

op1 

two decades ago stryker saw the potential that biologic products held for orthopaedics in an aging world and began a longterm investment in op1 a proprietary recombinant version of the bone growth factor osteogenic protein1 in 1991 the company received fda approval to begin human clinical trials of op1 which was developed in collaboration with creative biomolecules inc a company that subsequently merged into curis inc as part of a longterm research program funded by stryker the op1 device is composed of recombinant human op1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix op1 is naturally present in the human body and directs a cascade of cellular events that result in bone growth in preclinical studies op1 induced the formation

 7 

of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites the initial human clinical study which began in 1992 compared the efficacy of op1 with autograft the current standard bone graft procedure for the treatment of tibial nonunion fractures which uses bone chips removed from a patients hip in a second operation in the repair of nonunion fractures of the tibia in 1995 the fda allowed the company to enlarge the scope of the clinical trials for expanded indications of nonunion fractures in all long bones the study demonstrated that op1 patients had outcomes of comparable clinical success to those of the autograft patients this eliminated the need for a second invasive procedure to harvest autograft from the hip there were three prospectively determined clinical trial outcomes defined in the study weight bearing level of pain with weight bearing and radiographic assessment of cortical andor trabecular bridging the study design predicted 80 success at nine months postsurgery both the op1 and autograft groups met this prediction for the clinical outcomes of weight bearing and pain and both groups had comparable results the blinded radiographic assessment by an independent panel of radiologists showed that neither group achieved the 80 criteria for bridging although bridging was higher for the autograft group

the pma application for op1 was filed and accepted by the fda in june 1999 the company received a not approvable letter from the fda on january 29 2001 that cited the failure of the pivotal clinical trial to meet the study endpoint of noninferiority of op1 compared with the autograft control on a combined clinical and radiographic basis in 2001 stryker filed an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde from the fda the fda granted this approval in october 2001 this approval in the united states is for the use of op1 as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant longbone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed under the hde op1 was made available as a humanitarian device defined by the fda as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4000 individuals per year in the united states as of december 31 2003 more than 500 hospitals have received institutional review board irb approval to implant op1 in the united states under the hde

the company also filed a marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines evaluation agency emea for certain op1 uses and the maa was accepted for filing in july 1999 on december 14 2000 the committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp in europe voted unanimously to recommend market authorization for op1 for the indication of nonunions of the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft is not feasible final european approval was obtained in may 2001 for this indication a new drug application with the therapeutic goods administration tga in australia was filed in december 1999 and in february 2001 the australian drug evaluation committee adec adopted a positive opinion to recommend the granting of marketing authorization for op1 for treatment of longbone nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone formation approval from the tga was received in april 2001 in february 2002 the company received approval to market op1 in canada for the clinical indication of longbone nonunions

with these global approvals the first of their kind the company began to market op1 in 2002 and 2003 the increase in the number of patients treated demonstrated the success of its sales effort and the trust that surgeons have developed in the product based on favorable patient outcomes in the united states demand increased significantly during each quarter of 2003

stryker is committed to the further development of op1 for spinal indications including spinal stenosis this degenerative condition which is widespread in the over65 population causes severe pain in the lower back and legs as a result of abnormal movement in the lower spine spinal fusion is used to stabilize the spine and reduce stenosis pain fusing the spine with op1 can eliminate the need for a preliminary surgery to take bone from the patients hip to use in the fusion process

currently the company is conducting a multicenter pivotal trial in the united states and canada for posterolateral spine fusion using a new product op1 putty to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis in 2003 the company completed enrollment in this trial the company currently anticipates that the followup on the 297 enrolled patients will be completed in 2005 in japan the company completed enrollment in a 32patient phase ii trial for a similar indication using op1 in conjunction with rods and screws to fuse the spine 

in october 2002 the company entered into an agreement with curis inc which eliminated all royalties payable to curis relating to future stryker sales of op1 under the terms of the agreement the company made a 

 8 

onetime cash payment of 140 million to curis stryker owns the patents on its osteogenic protein technology and has exclusive worldwide rights under those patents to develop market and sell op1 for treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue 

the company has a royaltyfree crosslicense agreement with genetics institute inc a wholly owned subsidiary of wyeth which holds patents covering a molecule different from op1 that may produce similar effects the agreement enables stryker to commercialize op1 unencumbered by patent litigation with this competitor others also are attempting to develop osteogenic proteins and bioresorbable carriers for the treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue these other companies have filed and obtained patents in the united states and elsewhere claiming such compounds and methods of making them and using them and may in the future file and obtain other such patents the company can provide no assurance that it will not need a license under one or more of those patents to further expand the op1 program or whether such licenses will be available

   2003 compared with 2002 

stryker corporations net sales increased 20 in 2003 to 36253 million from 30116 million in 2002 net sales grew by 12 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 2 related to higher selling prices 5 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 1 as a result of acquired businesses 

domestic sales were 23334 million for 2003 representing an increase of 18 as a result of strong shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment and higher revenue from physical therapy services international sales were 12919 million for 2003 representing an increase of 24 as a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment the impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by 1459 million for 2003 excluding the impact of foreign currency international sales increased 10 in 2003

research development and engineering expenses represented 50 of sales in 2003 compared to 47 in 2002 the higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the companys product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches new product introductions in 2003 included the trident ceramic acetabular system simplex p with tobramycin bone cement and the core platform of micro powered surgical instruments in the united states market and the system 5 heavyduty batterypowered surgical instruments in europe

selling general and administrative expenses increased 22 in 2003 and represented 391 of sales compared with 387 in 2002 the 22 increase in selling general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20 increase in net sales in 2003 in addition the company incurred a 140 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums 

 20 

charged by thirdparty insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in other matters the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 is primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of orthopaedic implants increased amortization of loaner instrument sets the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the companys previously announced patient education campaign

the effective income tax rate was 305 in 2003 compared with 318 in 2002 the companys effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as ireland and puerto rico

cost of sales represented 369 of sales compared with 370 in 2001 the slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 was due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin orthopaedic implant products offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches

while research development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts they decreased to 47 of sales from 55 in 2001 research development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of op1 which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001 following the launch in 2002 stryker biotech recorded a portion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses compared with 2001 when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research development and engineering increased spending from the companys continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research development and engineering expenses related to stryker biotech new product introductions in 2002 included scorpioflex knee

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes on an ongoing basis management evaluates these estimates estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management additional accounts receivable writeoffs may be necessary which could unfavorably affect future operating results

inventory reserves 

the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant the

other matters 

the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases when the united states dollar strengthens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

the company follows the provisions of fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 137 and no 138 in accounting for its derivative financial instruments the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivatives that are not documented and accounted for as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings if a derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies

at december 31 2003 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 1239 million and sell 1549 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days at december 31 2002 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 820 million and sell 977 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted by current forward points a hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2003 fair value by approximately 21 million and would have changed the 2002 fair value by approximately 05 million

at december 31 2003 the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

the company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates as a result of its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility the company managed a portion of its interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements which had fixed the base rate on a 2500 million notional amount of the variablerate borrowings during 2003 these interest rate swap agreements expired during 2003 if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1 more than they did in 2003 the companys 2003

interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have increased and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by 07 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did during 2003 the companys 2003 interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have decreased and earnings before income taxes would have increased by 07 million if market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1 more than they did in 2003 the companys discount expense would have increased and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by 17 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did in 2003 the companys discount expense would have decreased and earnings before income taxes would have increased by 17 million these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the companys borrowing cost interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes

the companys interest rate swap agreements which matured over various terms ranging from september 2003 through december 2003 effectively converted a portion of its variablerate borrowings to a fixedrate basis thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on interest expense the company designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges gains of 92 million and 93 million and a loss of 220 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively interest rate differentials paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings 

the company has used yendenominated floatingrate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings but were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity net gains losses of 21 million 16 million and 58 million attributable to the yendenominated floatingrate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2003 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets by 1763 million this gain eliminated the previously recorded cumulative loss of 686 million that had been deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity at december 31 2002

on july 1 2002 the company acquired sdi from tyco international ltd for 1350 million in cash the acquisition expanded the companys spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the united states market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices the acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities the acquisition of sdi was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the results of operations for the acquired business are included in the companys consolidated financial statements beginning july 1 2002 the companys pro forma consolidated financial results in 2002 did not differ significantly as a result of the sdi acquisition

the company is partially selfinsured for product liability claims in 2003 the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the us to manage its selfinsured retention limits the captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 

during the second quarter of 2003 the company issued 50000 shares of restricted stock to its newly appointed president and chief operating officer the stock vests ratably on the first five anniversary dates of the grant provided that the recipient is still employed by the company the aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of 34 million as measured at the quoted price of the companys common stock has been recorded as deferred stockbased compensation a separate component of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the fiveyear vesting period

op1 

two decades ago stryker saw the potential that biologic products held for orthopaedics in an aging world and began a longterm investment in op1 a proprietary recombinant version of the bone growth factor osteogenic protein1 in 1991 the company received fda approval to begin human clinical trials of op1 which was developed in collaboration with creative biomolecules inc a company that subsequently merged into curis inc as part of a longterm research program funded by stryker since 1985 this device is composed of recombinant human op1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix op1 is naturally present in the human body and directs a cascade of cellular events that result in bone growth in preclinical studies op1 induced the formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites the initial human clinical study which began in 1992 compared the efficacy of op1 with autograft the current standard bone graft procedure for the treatment of tibial nonunion fractures which uses bone chips removed from a patients hip in a second operation in the repair of nonunion fractures of the tibia in 1995 the fda allowed the company to enlarge the scope of the clinical trials for expanded indications of nonunion fractures in all long bones the study demonstrated that op1 patients had outcomes of comparable clinical success to those of the autograft patients without the need for a second invasive procedure to harvest autograft from the hip there were three prospectively determined clinical trial outcomes defined in the study weightbearing level of pain with weightbearing and radiographic assessment of cortical andor trabecular bridging the study design predicted 80 success at nine months postsurgery both the op1 and autograft groups met this prediction for the clinical outcomes of weightbearing and pain and both groups had comparable results the blinded radiographic assessment by an independent panel of radiologists showed that neither group achieved the 80 criteria for bridging although bridging was higher for the autograft group

the pma application for op1 was filed and accepted by the fda in june 1999 the company received a not approvable letter from the fda on january 29 2001 that cited the failure of the pivotal clinical trial to meet the study endpoint of noninferiority of op1 compared with the autograft control on a combined clinical and radiographic basis in 2001 stryker biotech filed an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde from the fda the fda granted this approval in october 2001 this approval in the united states is for the use of op1 as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant longbone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed under the hde op1 was made available as a humanitarian device defined by the fda as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4000 individuals per year in the united states during the course of 2002 more than 200 hospitals received institutional review board irb approval to implant op1 in the united states under the hde

the company also filed a marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines evaluation agency emea for certain op1 uses which was accepted for filing in july 1999 on december 14 2000 the committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp in europe voted unanimously to recommend market authorization for op1 for the indication of nonunions of the tibia that have failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft is not feasible final european approval was obtained in may 2001 for this indication a new drug application with the therapeutic goods administration tga in australia was filed in december 1999 and in february 2001 the australian drug evaluation committee adec adopted a positive opinion to recommend the granting of marketing authorization for op1 for treatment of longbone nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone formation approval from the tga was received in april 2001 in february 2002 the company received approval to market op1 in canada for the clinical indication of longbone nonunions

with these global approvals the first of their kind the company began to market op1 in 2002 the increase in the number of patients treated demonstrated the success of its sales effort and the trust surgeons have developed in the product based on favorable patient outcomes during 2002 more than 2000 patients worldwide received implants of op1 more than the combined total from 1992 through 2001 in the united states demand increased significantly during each quarter of 2002 and op1 is now used at more than 250 institutions with multiple users at many of these sites

stryker is committed to the further development of op1 for spinal indications including spinal stenosis this degenerative condition which is widespread in the over65 population causes severe pain in the lower back and legs as a result of abnormal movement in the lower spine spinal fusion is used to stabilize the spine and reduce stenosis pain fusing the spine with op1 can eliminate the need for a preliminary surgery to take bone from the patients hip to use in the fusion process

currently the company is conducting a multicenter pivotal trial in the united states and canada for posterolateral spine fusion using a new product op1 putty to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis patients were actively enrolled during 2002 in the 312 patient study conducted at 25 hospital sites the company currently anticipates enrollment will be completed in 2003 and that the trial will be completed in 2005 in japan the company won approval from the ministry for health labor and welfare to conduct a multicenter phase ii trial for the same indication and began enrolling patients in 2002 in the japanese trial op1 is being used in conjunction with screw and rod systems to fuse the spine 

in october 2002 the company entered into an agreement with curis inc which eliminated all royalties payable to curis relating to future stryker sales of op1 under the terms of the agreement the company made a onetime cash payment of 140 million to curis stryker owns the patents on its osteogenic protein technology and has exclusive worldwide rights under those patents to develop market and sell op1 for treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue 

the company has a royaltyfree crosslicense agreement with genetics institute inc a wholly owned subsidiary of wyeth which holds patents covering a molecule different from op1 that may produce similar effects the agreement will enable stryker to commercialize op1 unencumbered by patent litigation with this competitor others also are attempting to develop osteogenic proteins and bioresorbable carriers for the treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue these other companies have filed and obtained patents in the united states and elsewhere claiming such compounds and methods of making them and using them and may in the future file and obtain other such patents the company can provide no assurance that it will not need a license under one or more of those patents to further expand the op1 program or whether such licenses will be available

the companys business is generally not seasonal in nature however the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months

competition 

the company is one of four leading competitors in the united states for orthopaedic reconstructive products the three other leading competitors are depuy orthopaedics inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson zimmer holdings inc and biomet inc while competition abroad varies from area to area the company believes it is also a leading player in the international markets with these same companies and centerpulse orthopedics inc a subsidiary of centerpulse ltd as its principal competitors

in the trauma segment stryker is one of four leaders competing principally with synthesstratec smith  nephew orthopaedics a division of smith  nephew plc and depuy orthopaedics inc

in the spinal implant segment the company is one of five leaders including the principal competitors medtronic sofamor danek inc a subsidiary of medtronic inc depuy acromed inc a subsidiary of johnson  johnson synthesstratec and centerpulse spinetech inc a subsidiary of centerpulse ltd

in the united states outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation market the companys primary competitors are independent therapistowned practices and hospitalbased services in addition to other national rehabilitation companies including healthsouth corporation and novacare rehabilitation a division of select medical corporation

the company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of hard and soft tissues that would compete with the companys op1 product wyeth has completed human clinical trials of a recombinant bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp2 for repair of orthopaedic and other skeletal defects and has awarded certain distribution rights to medtronic sofamor danek for rhbmp2 in the united states and europe a number of companies currently provide various other therapies including allografts bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue the company believes that its op1 product which is approved for limited trauma indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical trials for other indications would ultimately compete with these products and traditional therapies such as autograft

the principal factors that the company believes differentiate it in these highly competitive market segments and enable it to compete effectively are innovation reliability service and reputation the company is not able to predict the effect that continuing efforts to reduce healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular will have on the future sales of its products or its competitive position see regulation and product quality the company believes that its competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on the new products and improvements in existing products it is able to develop while the company does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive success patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent or trademark protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features stryker seeks to obtain patent protection whenever possible on its products the company currently has approximately 730 united states patents and 1190 international patents

manufacturing and sources of supply 

the companys manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining metal fabrication and assembly operations and the forging and investment casting of cobalt chrome and finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium approximately 12 of the companys cost of sales in 2002 represented finished products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers the company also purchases parts and components such as forgings castings gears bearings casters and electrical components and uses outside sources for certain finishing operations such as plating hardening and coating of machined components and sterilization of certain products the principal raw materials used by the company are stainless steel aluminum cobalt chrome and titanium alloys in all purchased parts and components from outside sources were approximately 40 of the total cost of sales in 2002

the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the safe medical devices act of 1990 and regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of the companys products

the fdas quality system regulations set forth standards for the companys product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of the companys facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the companys products the company believes that the manufacturing and quality control procedures it employs meet the requirements of these regulations 

most of the companys new products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k the companys op1 product requires extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by a pma application for a specific surgical indication 

stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical devices of each country in which the company manufactures or sells products the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain community european ce marks for their products stryker has authorization to apply the ce mark to its hip knee upper extremity spinal implant and trauma products and to its endoscopy instruments leibinger and medical division products the companys op1 product has been considered a drug under the regulations for europe australia and japan

government agencies legislative bodies and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in markets where the company does business including the united states europe and japan it is impossible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on the companys future business

  2002 compared with 2001 

stryker corporations net sales increased 16 in 2002 to 30116 million from 26023 million in 2001 net sales grew by 11 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 3 related to higher selling prices and 2 as a result of acquired businesses 

domestic sales were 19737 million for 2002 representing an increase of 17 as a result of strong shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment and higher revenue from physical therapy services the july 1 2002 acquisition of the surgical dynamics inc spinal implant business sdi from tyco international ltd added 228 million to domestic sales for 2002 international sales were 10379 million for 2002 representing an increase of 14 as a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment the acquisition of sdi added 25 million to international sales for 2002 the impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by 137 million for 2002 excluding the impact of foreign currency international sales increased 12 in 2002

cost of sales represented 369 of sales compared with 370 in 2001 the slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 is due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the companys manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin orthopaedic implant products offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches

while research development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts they decreased to 47 of sales from 55 in 2001 research development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of the osteogenic protein1 op1 product which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001 following the launch in 2002 stryker biotech recorded a greater proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses compared with 2001 when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research development and engineering increased spending from the companys continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research development and engineering expenses related to stryker biotech new product introductions in 2002 included scorpioflex knee for the united states market super securfit plus hip for the japanese market trident ceramic acetabular hip system in canada xia ii spinal system system 5 heavyduty batterypowered system tps saber drill sdc pro 2 surgical dvd documentation system painpump2 precision system for percutaneous cement delivery fluoroscopic software module for the stryker navigation system and go bed 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 18 in 2002 and represented 387 of sales compared with 379 in 2001 the increase in selling general and administrative expense is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 16 increase in net sales in 2002 in addition the company incurred an 89 million increase in insurance costs during 2002 the change in classification of certain stryker biotech expenses as discussed above also contributed to the increase in selling general and administrative expenses discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program which is included in selling general and administrative expenses declined to 27 million in 2002 from 58 million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates

the company recognized charges of 172 million in continuing operations 115 million net of income taxes relating to restructuring and acquisitionrelated items in the third quarter of 2002 and restructuring and acquisitionrelated charges of 06 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 the 2002 restructuring and acquisitionrelated items include a charge of 210 million 141 million net of income taxes for employmentrelated costs to close the companys rutherford new jersey manufacturing facility partially offset by a credit of 38 million 26 million net of income taxes to reverse certain howmedica restructuring and acquisitionrelated costs to reflect actual final payments required the 210 million restructuring charge relates to the shutdown agreement reached between the company and the employee bargaining unit to close the howmedica osteonics implant manufacturing facility in rutherford new jersey which was ratified by the members of the iuecwa local 485 on august 23 2002 under the agreement laidoff employees will receive significantly more benefits than they would have under the collective bargaining agreement that was set to expire on august 31 2002 in addition at least 80 qualified employees from the rutherford facility will be offered employment at the new howmedica osteonics facility in mahwah new jersey the charge covers employmentrelated severance costs for approximately 400 employees the company expects the rutherford facility to be closed over the next 12 months with final severance payments to be made in 2004 as howmedica osteonics prepares to permanently cease manufacturing in rutherford it will transition production to its facilities in mahwah new jersey as well as cork and limerick ireland

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recognized charges of 06 million in continuing operations related to various restructuring and acquisitionrelated events the 2001 restructuring and acquisitionrelated charges included 24 million of charges partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling 18 million see the following comparison of 2001 results to 2000 results for additional information

interest expense declined to 403 million in 2002 from 679 million in 2001 primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances the decrease in intangibles amortization to 289 million in 2002 from 384 million in 2001 is primarily the result of the companys adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  which prohibits the amortization of goodwill if the nonamortization provisions of statement no 142 had been applied in the prior year amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by 181 million and net earnings would have increased by 121 million 06 per diluted share other expense was 05 million in 2002 compared with 16 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year partially offset by higher interest income

2001 compared with 2000 

stryker corporations net sales increased 14 in 2001 to 26023 million from 22894 million in 2000 net sales grew by 12 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 3 related to higher selling prices 1 as a result of acquired businesses and 1 related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001 freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000 these increases were partially offset by a 3 decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

the companys domestic sales increased 20 in 2001 to 16884 million from 14082 million in 2000 the domestic sales gain was the result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants medsurg equipment and higher revenue from physical therapy services international sales increased 4 for the year to 9139 million from 8812 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment the impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by 621 million for the year excluding the impact of foreign currency international sales increased 11 in 2001 

worldwide sales of orthopaedic implants were 14472 million for 2001 representing an increase of 10 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive hip knee and shoulder trauma and spinal implants excluding the impact of foreign currency sales of orthopaedic implants increased 13 in 2001 worldwide sales of medsurg equipment were 9742 million for 2001 representing an increase of 18 based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments endoscopic systems hospital beds and stretchers and leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and imageguided surgical systems excluding the impact of foreign currency sales of medsurg equipment increased 20 in 2001 physical therapy services revenues were 1809 million for 2001 representing an increase of 23 as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers

cost of sales represented 370 of sales compared with 356 in 2000 the higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in the prior year the cost of sales percentage increased approximately 10 in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs cost of sales for 2001 was also higher by approximately 04 due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the companys manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels the company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost inventory management and expected sales growth a slight increase in orthopaedic implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lowermargin medsurg equipment products and physical therapy services

research development and engineering expenses increased 16 in 2001 and represented 55 of sales compared with 53 in 2000 the increase in research development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued companywide focus on new product development new product introductions in 2001 included the accolade cemented hip stem eius knee t2 intramedullary nail system reflex anterior cervical plate percutaneous cement delivery system elite attachments for tps cordless driver ii stryker knee navigation system sdc pro 2 surgical documentation system 988 digital camera go bed trio mobile surgery platform and an enhanced secure ii bed in the second quarter of 2001 the company received marketing approval for its op1 product in australia and the european union the approved indication in australia was for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation the approved indication in europe was for tibial nonunions of ninemonth duration secondary to trauma in skeletally mature patients in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company was granted humanitarian device exemption hde status for op1 by the united states food and drug administration fda the approved indication in the united states was for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed under the hde op1 has been made available as a humanitarian device defined by the fda as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4000 individuals per year in the united states the first commercial sales of op1 in australia began in midmay 2001 and the commercial launch of op1 in select markets of the european union began in august the first sales of op1 in the united states under the hde began in november the commercial launch of op1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001

selling general and administrative expenses increased 11 in 2001 and represented 379 of sales compared with 387 in 2000 the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 04 in 2001 in addition discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program which was included in selling general and administrative expenses declined to 58 million in 2001 from 71 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates

the company recognized charges of 06 million in continuing operations relating to various restructuring and acquisitionrelated events in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized restructuring and acquisitionrelated credits of 10 million in 2000 the 2001 restructuring and acquisitionrelated charges include 24 million of charges partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling 18 million the 24 million in 2001 charges included a 09 million acquisitionrelated charge for severance and related costs associated with the reorganization of the companys sales structure in italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from the companys independent italian distributor the reorganization established a direct sales force in italy that distributes the companys full product portfolio the 09 million charge covered severance costs for three employees in italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents the reorganization of the sales structure in italy was completed in the first quarter of 2002 the 2001 charge also included a 07 million charge related to the reorganization of the companys distribution channels in latin america and 08 million for severance costs for 10 employees in europe the 07 million charge reflected the cost to terminate a distributor and was based on contractual terms planned european workforce reductions were completed in the first quarter of 2002 the 18 million in credits included 14 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the companys european and japanese distribution operations the 2001 credits also included 04 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves established in japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999

interest expense declined to 679 million in 2001 from 966 million in 2000 primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances the increase in intangibles amortization to 384 million in 2001 from 347 million in 2000 related primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the second half of 2000 other income increased to 16 million in 2001 from other expense of 12 million in 2000 primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000 partially offset by lower interest income the effective income tax rate for 2001 was 330 compared with a 340 effective income tax rate in 2000 the decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions 

earnings before extraordinary item increased 23 to 2718 million in 2001 from 2210 million in 2000 basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22 to 138 in 2001 from 113 in 2000 and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22 to 134 in 2001 from 110 in 2000 in december 2001 the company refinanced and prepaid the remaining 6427 million outstanding under the 16500 million senior secured credit facilities established in 1998 in connection with the howmedica acquisition the prepayment of the 1998 facilities resulted in the writeoff of related unamortized deferred loan costs of 71 million which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of 48 million net of income taxes of 23 million 02 per basic and diluted share net earnings were 2670 million basic and diluted net earnings per share of 136 and 132 respectively compared with 2210 million basic and diluted net earnings per share of 113 and 110 respectively in 2000

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys working capital at december 31 2002 decreased 159 million to 4438 million from 4597 million at december 31 2001 the working capital decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances additional liabilities resulting from restructuring and acquisitionrelated items recorded during 2002 and increases in other accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories the additional liabilities from restructuring and acquisitionrelated items is the result of the aforementioned pending closure of the companys rutherford new jersey manufacturing facility other accrued liabilities increased in 2002 as a result of higher obligations for thirdparty sales agent commissions thirdparty royalties nonincome based taxes and general increases in other accrued liabilities accounts receivable days sales outstanding excluding the effect of the companys 1300 million accounts receivable securitization program decreased 1 day to 58 days at december 31 2002 from 59 days at december 31 2001 the lower days sales outstanding at december 31 2002 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in europe and latin america days sales in inventory decreased 12 days to 126 days at december 31 2002 from 138 days at december 31 2001 the lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches

the company generated cash of 5039 million from operations in 2002 compared with 4683 million in 2001 the generation of cash in 2002 is the result of strong cash earnings net earnings plus noncash adjustments and increases in accrued expenses and income tax liabilities and decreases in the accounts receivable and inventory days mentioned previously these items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of 84 million attributable to restructuring and acquisitionrelated liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities in 2002 the company used cash of 1736 million for business and product line acquisitions 1390 million for capital expenditures and 197 million for the payment of dividends business and product line acquisitions include 1350 million paid to tyco international ltd in the third quarter to acquire sdi 140 million paid to curis inc to eliminate all royalties payable on future sales of op1 and 100 million paid to pain concepts inc to acquire the dekompressor product line as further discussed in other matters in addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions the company borrowed an additional 4380 million under its existing credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2002 and made repayments of 8366 million against the credit facilities total borrowings declined by 2209 million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation

the companys future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows

 the companys additional borrowing capacity along with the expected expiration period of the commitments are summarized as follows

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes on an ongoing basis management evaluates these estimates estimates are based on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements

inventory reserves  the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis such marketplace changes may cause the companys products to become obsolete the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends if actual product life cycles product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results

income taxes  the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states accordingly management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues that may arise require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates the company believes its income tax accruals are adequate to cover exposures related to such potential changes in income allocation between tax jurisdictions to the extent additional information becomes available such accruals are adjusted to reflect revised probable outcomes

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles  the company follows the provisions of fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  in determining the amount if any by which the companys goodwill may be impaired in value the company uses the twostep process prescribed in statement no 142 the first step is a screen for potential impairment the second step if necessary measures the amount of the impairment inherent in the twostep process are certain assumptions and estimates necessary to determine fair values for reportable units as defined in statement no 142 should actual results or changes in future expectations differ from those projected by management goodwill impairment charges may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results see other matters for further discussion regarding the adoption of statement no 142

other matters 

the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies particularly the euro and the british pound when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines when the united states dollar weakens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged that are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2002 the strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in net assets by 794 million this gain reduced the previously recorded cumulative loss from weakening of foreign currencies that is deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity

as of january 1 2001 the company adopted fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 137 and no 138 the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings if a derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies

at december 31 2002 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 820 million and sell 977 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days at december 31 2001 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 974 million and sell 721 million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points a hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2002 fair value by approximately 05 million and would have changed the 2001 fair value by approximately 14 million

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility the company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements which have fixed the base rate on a 2500 million notional amount of the 4869 million of variablerate borrowings outstanding at december 31 2002 if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1 more than they did in 2002 the companys 2002 interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have increased and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by 11 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did during 2002 the companys 2002 interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have decreased and earnings before income taxes would have increased by 11 million if market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1 more than they did in 2002 the companys discount expense would have increased and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by 13 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did in 2002 the companys discount expense would have decreased and earnings before income taxes would have increased by 13 million these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the companys borrowing cost interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

the companys interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variablerate borrowings to a fixedrate basis through 2003 thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense approximately 51 of the companys outstanding variablerate borrowings as of december 31 2002 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges a gain of 93 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in 2002 if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variablerate borrowings would stop the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings based on the maturities of the companys interest rate swap agreements interest expense for the year ending december 31 2003 is expected to be 92 million higher than the interest cost on the variablerate borrowings through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at december 31 2002

the company uses yendenominated floatingrate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the consolidated statements of earnings but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity net gains losses of 16 million 58 million and 77 million attributable to the yendenominated floatingrate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

as of january 1 2002 the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  related to acquisitions completed before july 1 2001 statement no 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires the company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with the statements provisions an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of 55 million as of january 1 2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill in the first quarter of 2002 the company completed the initial impairment test of goodwill and in the fourth quarter of 2002 completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill as prescribed by statement no 142 and determined that recorded goodwill was not impaired and no goodwill writedown was necessary

in the outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation market the companys primary competitors are independent therapistowned practices and hospitalbased services in addition to other national rehabilitation companies including healthsouth corporation and novacare rehabilitation a division of select medical corporation

the company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of hard and soft tissues that would compete with the companys op1 implant including genetics institute inc a subsidiary of american home products corporation which has completed human clinical trials of a recombinant bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp2 for repair of orthopaedic and other skeletal defects based on the results of these studies american home has filed a pma in the united states for the indication of tibial fresh fractures american home received a not approvable letter in 2001 based on problems with the trial design a partner of genetics institute in the spine field medtronic sofamor danek filed a pma for the use of rhbmp2 in an interbody fusion cage medtronic sofamor danek obtained a unanimous approval recommendation from a fda advisory panel in january 2002 this vote will likely lead to fda approval in the first half of 2002 this product is a combination of a medtronic lt cage which is used with a collagen sponge soaked with bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp2 a number of other companies currently provide various other therapies including allografts bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue the company believes that its op1 implant which is approved for limited trauma indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical trials for certain other indications would ultimately compete with these products and traditional therapies such as autografts

the principal factors that the company believes differentiate its products in these highly competitive market segments and enable it to compete effectively are innovative products reliability service and reputation the company is not able to predict the effect that continuing efforts to reduce health care expenses generally and hospital costs in particular will have on the future sales of its products or its competitive position see regulation and product quality the company believes that its competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree upon the new products and improvements in existing products it is able to develop while the company does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive success patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or attribute of a product represents a unique design or process patent or trademark protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique product designs and features stryker seeks to obtain patent protection whenever possible on its products the company currently has approximately 657 us patents and 1015 foreign patents

manufacturing and sources of supply

the companys manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining metal fabrication and assembly operations and the forging and investment casting of cobalt chrome and finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium approximately 13 of the companys cost of sales in 2001 represented finished products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers the company also purchases parts and components such as forgings castings gears bearings casters and electrical components and uses outside sources for certain finishing operations such as plating hardening and coating of machined components and sterilization of certain products the principal raw materials used by the company are stainless steel aluminum cobalt chrome and titanium alloys in all purchases from outside sources were approximately 41 of the total cost of sales in 2001

while the company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and services it believes alternate sources are available if needed the company has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the materials necessary to meet its production schedules

products manufactured by the companys stryker medical division are generally assembled to order while other products are stocked in inventory

regulation and product quality

the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the safe medical devices act of 1990 and regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the fda of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices including most of the companys products

the fdas good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations set forth standards for the companys product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of the companys facilities by the fda there are also certain requirements of state local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the companys products the company believes that the manufacturing and quality control procedures it employs meet the requirements of these regulations 

most of the companys new products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k the companys op1 implant requires extensive clinical testing consisting of safety and efficacy studies followed by a pma application for specific surgical indication 

stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical devices of each country in which the company manufactures or sells products the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain community european ce marks for their products stryker has authorization to apply the ce mark to its hip knee upper extremity spinal implant and trauma products and its endoscopy instruments leibinger and medical division products the companys op1 implant has been considered a drug under the regulations for europe australia and japan

government agencies legislative bodies and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in countries where the company does business including the united states and japan it is impossible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on the companys future business

the table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the yeartoyear percentage change in dollar amounts

  

the table below sets forth domesticinternational and product line sales information

 2001 compared with 2000

stryker corporations net sales increased 14 in 2001 to 26023 million from 22894 million in 2000 net sales grew by 12 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 3 related to higher selling prices 1 as a result of acquired businesses and 1 related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001 freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000 these increases were partially offset by a 3 decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

the companys domestic sales increased 20 in 2001 to 16884 million from 14082 million in 2000 the domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants medsurg equipment and higher revenue from physical therapy services international sales increased 4 for the year to 9139 million from 8812 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment the impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by 621 million for the year excluding the impact of foreign currency international sales increased 11 in 2001 

worldwide sales of orthopaedic implants were 14425 million for 2001 representing an increase of 10 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive hip knee and shoulder trauma and spinal implants excluding the impact of foreign currency sales of orthopaedic implants increased 13 in 2001 worldwide sales of medsurg equipment were 9789 million for 2001 representing an increase of 18 based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments endoscopic systems hospital beds and stretchers and leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and imageguided surgical systems excluding the impact of foreign currency sales of medsurg equipment increased 20 in 2001 physical therapy services revenues were 1809 million for 2001 representing an increase of 23 as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers

cost of sales represented 370 of sales compared with 356 in 2000 the higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in the prior year the cost of sales percentage increased approximately 10 in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs cost of sales for 2001 were also higher by approximately 04 due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the companys manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels the company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost inventory management and expected sales growth a slight increase in orthopaedic implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lowermargin medsurg equipment products and physical therapy services

research development and engineering expenses increased 16 in 2001 and represented 55 of sales compared with 53 in 2000 the increase in research development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued companywide focus on new product development new product introductions in 2001 included the accolade cemented hip stem eius knee t2 intramedullary nail system reflex anterior cervical plate percutaneous cement delivery system elite attachments for tps cordless driver ii stryker knee navigation system sdc pro ii surgical documentation system 988 digital camera go bed trio mobile surgery platform and an enhanced secure ii bed in the second quarter of 2001 the company received marketing approval for its op1 implant product in australia and the european union the approved indication in australia is for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation the approved indication in europe is for tibial nonunions of ninemonth duration secondary to trauma in skeletally mature patients in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company was granted humanitarian device exemption hde status for op1 implant by the us food and drug administration fda the approved indication in the us is for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed under the hde op1 implant will be made available as a humanitarian device defined by the fda as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4000 individuals per year in the us the first commercial sales of op1 in australia began in midmay and the commercial launch of op1 in select markets of the european union began in august the first sales of op1 in the us under the hde began in november the commercial launch of op1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001 and the company cannot predict the impact on sales in future years

selling general and administrative expenses increased 11 in 2001 and represented 379 of sales compared with 387 in 2000 the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 04 in 2001 in addition discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program which is included in selling general and administrative expenses declined to 58 million in 2001 from 71 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates

interest expense declined to 679 million in 2001 from 966 million in 2000 primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances the increase in intangibles amortization to 384 million in 2001 from 347 million in 2000 relates primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the last half of 2000 other income increased to 16 million in 2001 from other expense of 12 million in 2000 primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000 partially offset by lower interest income the effective income tax rate for 2001 was 330 compared with a 340 effective income tax rate in 2000 the decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions 

earnings before extraordinary item increased 23 to 2718 million from 2210 million in 2000 basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22 to 138 in 2001 from 113 in 2000 and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22 to 134 in 2001 from 110 in 2000 in december 2001 the company refinanced and prepaid the remaining 6427 million outstanding under the 16500 million senior secured credit facilities established in 1998 in connection with the howmedica acquisition the prepayment of the 1998 facilities resulted in the writeoff of related unamortized deferred loan costs of 71 million which has been reflected as an extraordinary loss of 48 million net of income taxes of 23 million 02 per basic and diluted share net earnings were 2670 million basic and diluted net earnings per share of 136 and 132 respectively compared with 2210 million basic and diluted net earnings per share of 113 and 110 respectively in 2000

2000 compared with 1999

stryker corporations net sales increased 9 in 2000 to 22894 million from 21037 million in 1999 net sales grew by 9 as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix 1 related to higher selling prices and 1 as a result of acquired businesses these increases were partially offset by a 2 decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

the companys domestic sales increased 15 in 2000 compared with 1999 the domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants medsurg equipment and higher revenue from physical therapy services international sales increased 1 for the year as a result of higher shipments of orthopaedic implants and medsurg equipment the impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by 430 million for the year sales of discontinued products in 1999 were 77 million excluding the impact of foreign currency and discontinued products international sales increased 7 in 2000

cost of sales represented 356 of sales compared with 470 in 1999 the higher cost of sales percentage in 1999 resulted from 1982 million of additional nonrecurring cost of sales for inventory sold in 1999 that was steppedup to fair value in connection with the acquisition of howmedica compared with no inventory stepup included in 2000 cost of sales excluding the nonrecurring cost of sales charges for inventory stepup cost of sales would have declined from 376 of sales in 1999 to 356 in 2000 the decline is primarily the result of the realization of cost savings from cost reduction plans implemented at former howmedica manufacturing plants and of slightly higher selling prices in 2000

research development and engineering expenses increased 16 in 2000 and represented 53 of sales compared with 50 in 1999 the increase in research development and engineering spending in 2000 resulted from continued companywide focus on new product development new product introductions in 2000 included crossfire highly crosslinked polyethylene for howmedica implants the scorpio ts revision knee system stryker instruments tps u2 drill the sterishield t4 personal protection system the stryker navigation system the antigraderetrograde intramedullary nail the opus spinal system resorbable craniomaxillofacial plates and screws and in certain international markets simplex p bone cement with tobramycin

selling general and administrative expenses increased 10 in 2000 and represented 387 of sales compared with 384 in 1999 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were comparable in both years after considering the inclusion of 71 million in 2000 and 06 million in 1999 of discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program established in november 1999

liquidity and capital resources

the companys working capital at december 31 2001 increased 801 million to 4597 million from 3796 million at december 31 2000 the working capital increase is due primarily to the reduction in current maturities of longterm debt of 1343 million partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities and accrued expenses the reduction in current maturities of longterm debt is due to the establishment of a new revolving credit facility as described in more detail below in december 2001 which does not require principal repayments in 2002 accounts receivable days sales outstanding excluding the effect of the securitization program decreased 10 days to 59 days at the end of 2001 from 69 days at december 31 2000 the lower days sales outstanding at december 31 2001 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in latin america and europe days sales in inventory decreased to 138 days at december 31 2001 from 166 days at december 31 2000 the lower days sales in inventory at december 31 2001 is primarily the result of improved inventory management

the company generated cash of 4683 million from operations in 2001 compared with 3318 million in 2000 the generation of cash in 2001 is the result of strong cash earnings net earnings plus noncash adjustments and increases in accrued expenses income tax liabilities and accounts payable these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable inventories and deferred charges and payments of 112 million attributable to acquisitionrelated and restructuring charges and acquisition purchase liabilities in 2001 the company used cash of 1619 million for capital expenditures 430 million for business acquisitions and 157 million for the payment of dividends capital expenditures included 878 million to terminate a synthetic lease and purchase the companys mahwah new jersey manufacturing and distribution facility business acquisitions include 272 million paid to pfizer inc for final settlement of a working capital adjustment relating to the howmedica purchase price 

in december 2001 the company established 10000 million in unsecured credit facilities these facilities replaced the 16500 million senior secured credit facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of howmedica the unsecured credit facilities include a 2500 million 364day revolving credit agreement and a 7500 million fiveyear nonamortizing revolving credit agreement a total of 7305 million was drawn under the new credit facilities of which 6427 million prepaid the debt outstanding under the 1998 facilities and 878 million was used to terminate the companys synthetic lease and purchase its mahwah new jersey manufacturing and distribution facility in addition to the refinancing the company borrowed 2053 million under credit facilities to fund cash flow needs at various times during 2001 and made repayments of 5687 million against credit facilities during 2001 total debt declined by 2899 million during 2001

in november 1999 the company established a securitization facility under which certain domestic accounts receivable are sold on an ongoing basis to a specialpurpose subsidiary that in turn may sell up to a 1300 million interest in such receivables to a third party the accounts receivable securitization facility was established to reduce the companys overall cost of borrowing the accounts receivable securitization facility provided 27 million of proceeds during 2001 with the programtodate proceeds totaling 1300 million as of december 31 2001 the proceeds have been used to reduce the companys longterm debt

the company had 501 million in cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2001 the company also had outstanding borrowings totaling 7226 million at that date current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2001 are 17 million and will decrease to 02 million in 2003 and 01 million in 2004 the companys 2500 million 364day revolving credit agreement expires in december 2002 and is renewable at the companys and the lenders discretion the companys 7500 million fiveyear nonamortizing revolving credit agreement expires in december 2006 the company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments should additional funds be required the company had 3462 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at december 31 2001

other matters

the company finalized its plan to integrate howmedica and stryker in 1999 as the integration plan evolved and was implemented during 1999 the company made certain adjustments to the purchase liabilities recorded in the preliminary purchase price allocation the additional purchase liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of howmedica totaled 1265 million at december 31 2001 there were 41 million in additional purchase liabilities remaining to be paid out certain obligations such as those related to lease commitments for facility closures will result in payments extending to 2008

the company distributes its products throughout the world as a result the companys financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets the companys operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies in particular the euro and the british pound when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines when the us dollar weakens the opposite situation occurs the company manufactures its products in the united states france germany ireland switzerland canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the companys cost of sales

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies

at december 31 2001 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 974 million and sell 721 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities principally ranging from 30 to 180 days at december 31 2000 the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase 827 million and sell 338 million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from 30 to 180 days the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at monthend spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points a hypothetical 10 change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2001 fair value by approximately 14 million and would have changed the 2000 fair value by approximately 16 million

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility the company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements which have fixed the base rate on a 5500 million notional amount of the 7172 million of variablerate borrowings outstanding at december 31 2001 if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1 more than they did in 2001 the companys 2001 interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have increased and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by 28 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did during 2001 the companys 2001 interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps would have decreased and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by 28 million if market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1 more than they did in 2001 the companys discount expense would have increased and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by 13 million by comparison if market interest rates had averaged 1 less than they did in 2001 the companys discount expense would have decreased and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by 13 million these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the companys borrowing cost interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

as of january 1 2001 the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 137 and no 138 the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings if a derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 

the companys interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variablerate borrowings to a fixedrate basis through 2003 thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense approximately 77 of the companys outstanding variablerate borrowings as of december 31 2001 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges upon adoption of the statements on january 1 2001 the company recognized a gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change of 35 million in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss related to the interest rate swap agreements a loss of 220 million attributable to a decrease in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in 2001 if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variablerate borrowings would stop the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized gains losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings based on the maturities of the companys interest rate swap agreements interest expense for the year ending december 31 2002 is expected to increase by 82 million through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at december 31 2001

the company uses yendenominated floatingrate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the consolidated statements of earnings but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity net gains losses of 58 million 77 million and 74 million attributable to the yendenominated floatingrate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively 

in june 2001 the fasb issued statement no 141 business combinations and statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets statement no 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 statement no 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires the company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis it is effective for business combinations completed after june 30 2001 the company began applying the provisions of statement no 142 to acquisitions completed subsequent to june 30 2001 the goodwill recorded as a result of those acquisitions is not being amortized for goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations completed before july 1 2001 the company is required to apply the provisions of statement no 142 beginning on january 1 2002 in accordance with the statement provisions an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of 55 million will be reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill at that date application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement in the year ending december 31 2002 is expected to reduce intangibles amortization by approximately 16 million and increase net earnings by approximately 11 million 05 per diluted share 

in the first quarter of 2002 the company will perform the initial impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of january 1 2002 the company will test for impairment using the twostep process prescribed in statement no 142 the first step is a screen for potential impairment the second step if necessary measures the amount of the impairment any impairment charge resulting from these initial impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002 the company has not yet determined what effect the tests will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position the company will perform a subsequent impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and then at least annually thereafter

as discussed in liquidity and capital resources the company established 10000 million in unsecured credit facilities in december 2001 these facilities replaced the 16500 million secured senior credit facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of howmedica interest expense for 2002 is expected to be reduced by approximately 9 million as a result of the refinancing

as a result of changed conditions in the insurance industry including less favorable experience factors within the orthopaedic industry the companys cost for insurance coverage will increase substantially in 2002 the increase in insurance premiums will offset the 9 million in interest expense savings from the december 2001 debt refinancing
