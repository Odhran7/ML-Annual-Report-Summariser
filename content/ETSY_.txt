our strategy 

as illustrated below our strategy is focused around 

• building a sustainable competitive advantage  our “right to win” 

• growing the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies and 

• leveraging our marketplace playbook across our “house of brands” 

building a sustainable competitive advantage  our “right to win” 

our “right to win” is centered on four key elements that we believe make etsycom a better place to shop and sell and which in turn will bring more buyers lead to increased frequency and size of purchases and build trust in the etsy marketplace we believe that when executed effectively these elements can create a multiplier effect that will drive future growth 

our sellers’ collection of unique items  the foundation of etsycom’s competitive advantage is our sellers’ collection of millions of unique items sellers choose to list their collections of unique items on our marketplace because they believe that we are the best place for them to start and grow a creative business and that we have created a community that attracts supports and retains some of the world’s most talented makers the unique nature of our sellers’ items requires that we invest in the other three elements of our strategy search and discovery human connections and our trusted brand in order to deliver a bestinclass marketplace experience 

bestinclass search and discovery  we are focused on continuing to develop a search and discovery experience that unlocks the value of the unique items that can be found on the etsy marketplace with millions of items listed on etsycom that don’t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit “sku” our challenge is delivering worldclass search and discovery technology that surfaces the right unique product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive sales and buyer satisfaction we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help personalize the search experience and enable etsy buyers to more easily browse filter and find the items they desire we’re investing in multiple areas focused on understanding buyer tastes and preferences as we strive to anticipate and inspire their next purchase 

the power of human connections  our mission to “keep commerce human” is a vital part of our strategy we continue to emphasize the role that humans play in every aspect of our business what makes the etsy marketplace special isn’t just the unique items in our marketplace it’s also the stories of how those items were brought to life by the hands of real people our buyer experience allows etsy buyers to work with etsy sellers to personalize or customize items to their exact specifications we believe that fostering and elevating the quality of these human connections will continue to enable us to drive buyer engagement loyalty and purchase frequency thus differentiating etsycom from other places you can shop 

our trusted brand  we will continue to focus on being a reliable brand that inspires trust along the buyer journey — when buyers search purchase anticipate and receive their special items and all the steps in between since etsy sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items we aim to ensure that the etsy brand is recognized and valued for providing an excellent endtoend experience there are two key elements to being a trusted brand standing for something that buyers understand and rely on and delivering a purchasing experience that feels efficient and safe our goal is to bolster trust in the etsy brand etsy sellers the items available on etsy and in the overall etsy experience 

growing the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies 

we are focused on growing the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies as illustrated above while we have sellers and buyers around the world we define our core geographies as locations that meet any of the following criteria 

• represent our most attractive buyer gms opportunities 

• where we currently have or believe we can create a vibrant twosided marketplace or 

• where we’re making strategic investments in domestic growth 

we will also continue to evaluate additional geographies for strategic investments 

leveraging our marketplace playbook across our “house of brands” 

we now have four valuesaligned ecommerce marketplaces offering noncommoditized items in our “house of brands” etsy reverb depop and elo7 which stand for creativity community and “special” our goal is that all four marketplaces will benefit from shared expertise in product marketing technology and customer support and that the sum of the whole over time will equal more than its individual parts 

we believe our marketplaces all share key elements central to success including 

• analytical frameworks product experiment and measurement approaches and operating rhythms that prioritize resource allocation towards the most impactful outcomes 

• sophisticated search and discovery technology 

• compelling onsite customer experiences 

• efficient payment platforms 

• valueadded seller services such as advertising platforms and effective shipping options 

• strong brand and performance marketing capabilities and 

• a commitment to investments that protect the marketplace 

we have created crossfunctional crossmarketplace initiatives designed to accelerate value creation across our newly acquired marketplaces enabled by the deep subject matter expertise developed over the past several years within the etsy leadership team each of these initiatives apply marketplace best practices to each brand’s specialty or demographic we will monitor these early collaborations through the year and adjust depending upon the needs and market dynamics of each brand 

lastly etsy’s strategy to a lesser extent also includes selectively pursuing acquisitions of businesses or technologies that complement our marketplaces or align with our overall growth strategy such acquisitions could help us expand our geographic reach enter or deepen our exposure to product categories or expand our technology portfolio or offering 

how we make money 

we see our business model as a virtuous circle  we connect sellers and buyers enable their transactions receive fees for our services and then reinvest in customer experiences to further grow etsy and our sellers’ revenue we generate revenue primarily from marketplace activities including transaction listing and payments processing fees and fees for optional seller services which include onsite advertising and shipping labels for more information see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— components of our results of operations—revenue” 



our “house of brands” marketplaces 

the etsy marketplace 

buyers come to the etsy marketplace for meaningful oneofakind items handcrafted and curated with passion and expertise by our creative entrepreneurs we are focused on attracting potential buyers to etsy for everyday items that have meaning and those “special” purchase occasions that happen throughout the year these include items that reflect an individual’s unique style gifting that demonstrates thought and care and celebrations that express creativity and fun 

etsy purchase occasions can happen frequently throughout the year  when a buyer is decorating a home selecting an outfit for a special event planning a celebration for a special moment or buying a gift for someone else in fact according to a 2021 etsy buyer survey 

• 87 of buyers say “ etsy has items i can’t find anywhere else” 

• 72 of buyers agree “ there is no other store or website similar to etsy” and 

• when asked the reasons for their most recent visit to etsy buyers were asked to indicate all that apply 55 of buyers said “ to look for a specific unique item to purchase for myself” 36 said “ to look for a gift for someone else” 23 said “ to treat myself with a purchase” 20 said “to browse or seek inspiration” and 9 said “to celebrate a major life event” 

beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2021 the covid19 pandemic and other global macroeconomic factors drove a significant shift to online purchasing in many retail categories millions of buyers found etsy for the first time or discovered us again for many everyday items including those that at the beginning of the pandemic were temporarily unavailable elsewhere our sellers’ ability to provide these items to buyers enabled etsy to reinforce our brand messaging aligning handcrafted and “special” with everyday purchase occasions we’ve developed a thoughtful and powerful strategy to define what “everyday” means for etsy bringing it to life in our marketing and product experiences we’ve also continued to deepen our brand’s connection to small businesses and the dynamic unique inventory available on etsy 

throughout 2021 we focused on deepening our engagement with buyers encouraging them to consider etsy as a starting point for their purchase or inspiration journeys across many retail categories and shopping occasions as a result we’ve seen a meaningful increase in overall buyer frequency and habitual buyers our most loyal are the fastest growing buyer segment in fact gms from existing etsy buyers grew 34 yearoveryear in 2021 and represented approximately 87 of overall etsycom gms you can read more about the performance of our buyer segments below 

we believe the etsy marketplace is characterized by several unique qualities including 

• a brand that stands for “intentional shopping” in a world of increasing automation and commoditization etsycom is a marketplace where creativity lives and thrives because it’s powered by people we help our community of sellers turn their ideas into successful businesses our platform connects them with millions of buyers looking for an alternative—something special that expresses their taste and values 

• unique products etsy boasts a large assortment of handmade customized personalized vintage and craft supply products from all over the world as of december 31 2021 there were nearly 100 million i tems listed on the etsy marketplace and approximately 23 of our 2021 gms was from custom or madetoorder merchandise 

• global reach in 2021 42 of etsy sellers were located outside the united states and 43 of our gms was generated between an etsy seller etsy buyer or both located outside of the united states our platform makes it easy for etsy buyers and sellers to interact across borders even if they do not speak the same language and wish to transact in different currencies we use innovative machine translation technology to translate listings reviews etsy ads and conversations between buyers and sellers we invest in localization particularly within our core nonus markets to create a more localized experience such as browse features and shipping filters which has resulted in more buyers purchasing from sellers within their own country in fact our fastest growing trade route is between buyers and sellers in the same nonus country and in 2021 over 70 of gms in the united kingdom and germany was from domestic sales 

• organic traffic base the unique nature of our sellers’ inventory and power of our brand have enabled us to organically build a loyal global base of etsy buyers on the platform in 2021  81 o f our gms was generated through organic channels including a large portion from buyers visiting etsy directly as well as from nonpaid channels such as search social email and push notifications 

• connection between etsy buyers and sellers as of december 31 2021 901 million buyers and 53 million sellers were active on the etsy marketplace we emphasize that the items listed for sale on the etsy marketplace are brought to life by real people and that buyers can connect directly with sellers in order to ask questions and personalize or customize items to their specifications  one example of how we are enabling buyers and sellers to engage in new more human ways is our use of listing videos where sellers showcase their expertise in making and bringing their products to life approximately 13 million seller videos were uploaded as of december 31 2021 

• connected experience across all devices we want to engage etsy buyers wherever they are and provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience regardless of the format our mobile website and our etsy mobile app for etsy buyers “buy on etsy” include search and discovery curation personalization augmented reality and social shopping features for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 64 of etsycom gms was generated on a mobile device through product investments that drive buyers to our app we’ve been able to increase app downloads by 47 in 2021 which is beneficial to conversion rat e as our mobile app channel has the highest conversion rate among devices 

• buyer intent people come to the etsy marketplace to browse and be inspired our platform is designed to provide a personalized search experience to etsy buyers adjusting results and recommendations based on transaction data and previous browsing history we are continuing to build more sophisticated algorithms that allow us to deliver more personalized results to our buyers utilizing browsing and transaction data to surface items buyers didn’t know they wanted i n 2021 we launched a proprietary capability we call “xwalk” a largescale realtime graph retrieval engine that dramatically expands the available data processed to capture semantic meaning and to improve conversion rate by showing more relevant inventory to buyers 

the reverb marketplace 

reverb headquartered in chicago is a unique twosided marketplace founded in 2013 on the principle that buying and selling musical instruments should be easy reverb connects buyers and sellers of new used and vintage musical gear from all over the world uniting music makers with the gear that inspires them as of december 31 2021 our reverb marketplace had 847 thousand active buyers and 210 thousand active sellers reverb’s buyers and sellers range from beginning musicians looking for their first instruments to professional musicians that utilize the platform to expand their tools local music stores that use reverb to do more business online and the largest music retailers in the world that use reverb to reach an even larger audience in 2021 over 65 of reverb’s active sellers also bought on reverb and those that bought and sold gear spent two times more than those that bought gear on reverb but did not sell on reverb 

reverb’s unique characteristics include the depth and breadth of its sellers’ inventory 16 million listings as of december 31 2021 range of sellers including retailers manufacturers and individual sellers distributed across the globe one of the largest musical instrument databases with historical pricing data in the world and a large and passionate community of musicians and music gear lovers in 2021 reverb invested in improving platform engagement optimizing conversion rate improving the user experience advertising and driving international growth 

after a very strong growth year in 2020 reverb again grew gms in 2021 up 16 year over year despite other musical instruments sales channels being reopened further reverb significantly outpaced the growth of the musical instruments market on a twoyear basis reverb’s growth strategy continues to be focused on making it easier to sell and ship gear becoming the best destination for special gear and expanding internationally 

the depop marketplace 

depop headquartered in london  is dedicated to building the world’s most diverse and progressive home of fashion since its founding in 2011 depop has evolved to become a communitypowered fashion marketplace to buy and sell unique fashion with approximately 26 million registered users depop had approximat ely 37 million active buyers and 20 million a ctive sellers at december 31 2021 approximately 6 0 of depop sellers who made a sale in 2021 also made at least one purchase in 2021 which we believe shows the strong engagement of depop’s user base approximately 90 o f depop’s gms is in the apparel category depop had approximately 166 million listings as of december 31 2021  

depop is a place for anyone to discover and celebrate their style on their own terms and to feel good about their fashion choices by extending the lives of millions of garments we believe depop has a meaningful growth opportunity given its strong user engagement metrics leading resale market position with the “generation z” “gen z” consumer demographic and strong brand awareness in its core markets united kingdom and united states as of december 31 2021 the majority of depop’s users were gen z the demographic cohort succeeding millennials and known as “digital natives” as they are the first social generation to have grown up with access to the internet and portable digital technology from a young age according to a 2021 thredup annual resale report which looked at trailing twelve month “ttm” data ove r 40 of gen z and millennial shoppers shopped secondhand fashion in 2020 

depop’s gms is incremental to etsy’s consolidated results for the periods we owned the business in 2021 depop experienced very strong growth in 2020 followed by reopening headwinds in 2021 i n 2022 depop will be focused on making investments in product and marketing designed to reignite growth and drive engagement and conversion rate and exploring valueadded services to drive monetization and improved profitability 

the elo7 marketplace 

elo7 known as the “etsy of brazil” was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in são paulo brazil elo7 specializes in custom and madetoorder merchandise connecting approximately 55 thousand active sellers and 18 million a ctive buyers and had approximately 99 million items for sale as of december 31 2021 approximately 70 of elo7’s gms is from repeat buyers 

elo7s marketplace includes items in over 40 retail categories with a significant amount of gms from special event and life moment categories in 2021 elo7’s top categories were paper and party supplies housewares and home furnishings baby and kids apparel weddings and craft supplies elo7 is ranked as a top 10 ecommerce site in br azil according to conversion ecommerce report in brazil april 2021 providing us with a strong local brand in the largest latin american ecommerce regio n 

given its exposure to the “special events and life moment” category whose celebrations were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic elo7 underperformed the broader ecommerce sector in 2020 and 2021 elo 7’s nearterm priorities are focused on optimizing conversion rate leveraging etsy’s knowhow to further invest in product and marketing with a disciplined return on investment lens and giving sellers tools to help them grow including access to more options for fast and affordable shipping that buyers can rely on similar to etsy we believe that elo7 can expand its “consideration set” in the mind of brazilian consumers becoming a destination they turn to more frequently for more of life’s special moments 

primary business drivers 

we leverage technology to connect people around the world through commerce among other things we invest in our technology and infrastructure product development marketing trust and safety member support and seller tools and education as we strive to continuously improve our marketplaces for our buyers and sellers while the discussion below focuses on the primary drivers of the etsy marketplace there are similar business drivers at each of our marketplaces 

technology infrastructure 

our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices this team writes deploys and operates the software and services that enable us to run our business including the web and mobile products we deploy externally and internally and maintains our cloud environment and local office networks and more etsy also makes significant investments in areas such as foundational infrastructure our payments platform cyber security internal information technology data enablement and system architecture 

we collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and test features on our website our use of machine learning algorithms on the etsy marketplace creates an engaging shopping experience and helps etsy sellers and etsy buyers connect across our platform we apply proprietary machine learning artificial intelligence and human curation to personalize the search and recommendations experiences and enable buyers to more easily browse filter and buy that perfect item even when they may not have something specific in mind machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our etsy marketplace which we believe significantly increases the items available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and gives etsy sellers access to a truly global audience 

in addition our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform since the etsy marketplace’s migration to google cloud completed in 2020 we’ve increased engineering efficiency shifting the focus from maintaining onpremise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic as the covid19 pandemic shifted consumer shopping habits to more online commerce traffic volume increased dramatically and the cloud migration enabled us to dynamically flex our infrastructure in addition to its flexible capacity we also believe the cloud has enhanced our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble technology on an as needed basis our subsidiary marketplaces reverb depop and elo7 also operate their marketplaces in the cloud and make similar technical development investments with amazon web services “aws” 

product development 

etsy’s product development and engineering organization is built around the core belief that we can create connections between our sellers and buyers that are personal and fundamentally different from those in other places you can shop or sell we believe we have a novel approach to product development which we call our product development culture an evolving set of key principles mindsets and habits that guide how our teams work experiment and interact as we develop great experiences for our customers and business our teams are organized around a collection of initiatives that support a common strategy aligned with our “right to win” with cross functional teams focused on a single key performance indicator “kpi” and set of objectives and key results all meant to solve key customer friction points product and engineering groups work across all areas that matter to our buyers and sellers  the core buyer and seller experience search and ads payments fulfillment member support and more our approach to solving customer challenges include deep research ab testing exploratory analysis product management design engineering and product marketing gotomarket strategies 

just a few examples of our 2021 product and engineering investments include our work to build buyer confidence in etsy purchases including improvements to the postpurchase experience and greater transparency into expected delivery date and order status as of december 31 2021 67 of sellers’ items on the etsy marketplace offered free shipping to us buyers and 46 of global orders were delivered with free shipping we also made significant improvements in shipping transparency as of december 31 2021 nearly 100 of us listing views had an expected delivery date additional examples of product investments launched in 2021 to drive frequency include new personalized buyer onboarding and investments in our updates tab which prompts buyer actions such as favoriting 

etsy also shares aspects of its product development culture and strategies with our other brands we are early in this effort and believe that over time increased focus on experimentation search recommendations and fulfillment will improve the customer experience across all of our marketplaces 

marketing 

we believe that our approach to investments in marketing are somewhat different from some other players in ecommerce and we continue to evolve and refine these activities as a core component of our business we’ve evolved our marketing strategy to reinforce our core brand promise in the minds of etsy buyers and we’ve strengthened our capabilities by employing a fullfunnel marketing approach optimizing our investments in each area of the funnel our two primary types of marketing investments performance and brand  where we spent approximately 431 million and 126 million respectively on a consolidated basis in 2021  are discussed below 

performance marketing in 2021 the percentage of consolidated gms attributed to performance marketing paid gms was 19 our investments in performance marketing which we define as paid media spend related to the digital acquisition and reengagement of buyers adjusts according to demand and scale based on incremental return we do not set fixed budgets for our marketing team our investment philosophy for performance marketing is to invest until the marginal return on investment “roi” on the next dollar spent is below our target minimum roi increases in buyer lifetime value “ltv” driven by visits conversion rate incremental revenue and frequency shifts the return curve enabling us to spend more in marketing the vast majority of return comes inperiod although some does fall into subsequent quarters our performance marketing spend naturally adjusts with demand which we believe has worked well for us through changing demand and pricing for thirdparty marketing channels 

in may 2020 we launched our innovative advertising program for etsy marketplace sellers called offsite ads in this offering etsy pays the upfront costs to promote etsy sellers’ listings on multiple internet platform and sellers only pay an additional fee when they make a sale when a shopper clicks on an offsite ad featuring a seller’s listing and purchases from the seller’s shop within 30 days of that click the seller pays etsy a transaction fee on that order we believe our offsite ads program is a winwin for etsy and our sellers because sellers only pay a fee when they make a sale and the additional fee enables etsy to expand the ltv as outlined above enabling us to spend deeper to drive more visits to our marketplace in 2021 revenue from offsite ads offset approximately 33 of our performance marketing spend 

brand marketing since 2018 etsy has leaned more heavily into “upper funnel” brand marketing strategies through tv digital video and paid social to create a flywheel designed to elevate the effectiveness of our other marketing channels our strategies have significantly improved brand awareness and loyalty our us etsy buyer surveys indicate that since the fourth quarter of 2018 we have nearly doubled buyers’ loyalty prompted awareness is up 11 percentage points and unprompted awareness is up 8 percentage points in addition purchase intent has grown over 100 and visit intent has nearly doubled in that same time period we believe that etsy still has significant room to build “top of mind awareness” and consideration in the minds of buyers within the data cited above there was strong positive movement across the brand survey from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the 

fourth quarter of 2021 we are seeing great movement in our brand funnel metrics in the other two core markets where we are investing in top of the funnel marketing in the united kingdom unprompted awareness is up 10 percentage points year over year and in germany that same metric has more than doubled 

we anticipate that brand marketing will continue to increase as a percentage of our spend lengthening the payback period for our marketing investments overall to measure the impact of tv we use a blended approach that combines our own internal analysis with multiple thirdparty methodologies as well as tracking brand metrics such as awareness and preference 

in addition we’re expanding into new marketing channels such as influencer collaborations to reach new buyers and drive deeper engagement with existing buyers through these collaborations which include cocreated items and custom curated favorites etsy and our sellers partner with celebrities and influencers who are passionate about etsy to drive engagement reach impressions and visits our marketing strategy also includes sophisticated customer relationship management tools that enable us to segment and target our buyers for engagement on and off etsy “mid funnel” advertising such as on social media channels and corporate marketing partnerships to target specific buyer demographics we also build our brand globally through earned media that features etsy as a trendsetter and global destination for conscious shopping that supports small business 

our other marketplaces are not yet as sophisticated as etsycom in either performance or brand marketing and we see further opportunity following early collaborations to share expertise through projects and personnel across our brands we believe increased collaboration has the potential to drive future growth 

trust  safety 

the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business our policies are designed to encourage transparency among our members by clearly outlining the rights and responsibilities of sellers and buyers participating on our platforms 

on etsycom we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain standards which starts with our policies fundamentally we require that goods listed on etsy be handmade whether by the seller alone or with the help of a production partner vintage or craft supplies etsy is an unjuried marketplace meaning sellers run their own shops create sell and ship their own products and are responsible for complying with our robust seller policy items on etsy do not have barcodes or skus and etsy does not ever touch or possess the items for sale on our marketplace the unique nature of etsy sellers’ product inventory combined with the constantly evolving nature of policy interpretation necessitates expert human involvement in content moderation which we combine with the power of cuttingedge tools and technology our teams continuously reevaluate content on etsycom in the context of emerging trends to determine whether such content violates our house rules or terms of use including our prohibited items policy etsycom has a zero tolerance approach for items that promote support or glorify hate or violence or that perpetuate the spread of harmful misinformation 

beyond prohibited content detection and removal we have grounded our content moderation program and product roadmap in ensuring that buyers can trust their experience and have the information they need to make informed purchase decisions and that sellers can understand what is required of them including whether their listing is permitted under our policies we remain committed to ensuring that any member can easily alert etsy about potential violations of our policies we have also taken steps to ensure that etsy sellers are positioned for success by making our policies easy to understand refining our violation notification process and providing resources to help sellers when they have compliance questions 

as the etsy marketplace has experienced significant growth over the last few years we have increased our investments and resources dedicated to trust and safety this includes scaling our teams and investing in new tools and advanced technologies to enable these teams to more effectively and efficiently do their jobs this included growing our content moderation team adding a new handmade and counterfeit team dedicated to fighting counterfeits and violations of our handmade policy and creating a dedicated trust and safety machine learning engineering team 

we publish an annual transparency report which details our policy enforcement for the year on intellectual property prohibited items and requests for member information policies we have shared this report on our corporate website annually since 2015 and believe that publicly reporting on our enforcement efforts builds trust in our marketplace and community 

our other marketplaces – depop reverb and elo7 – also care about running trustworthy marketplaces and maintain robust community guidelines and prohibited items policies you can read more about their respective policies and procedures by visiting their marketplace websites 

member support 

as the etsy marketplace has scaled so have our investments in member support when customers need assistance on etsycom we jump in and work to help resolve problems quickly as the primary touch point for our vibrant community of buyers and sellers our member services team serves as both the voice of the etsy brand and an important advocate for our community when an issue arises or a user has a question we want to ensure they get support quickly and easily in 2021 we made specific improvements to our case management system and we invested in selfservice better dashboards and education for our sellers so they can more quickly resolve issues without our intervention here are some other examples of improvements we have made 

• chat is an increasingly preferred option among many etsy users we have significantly expanded our live chat support in recent years and we’ll continue to dedicate more resources to this feature 

• we’ve eliminated the hassle of lengthy hold times for those buyers who prefer to speak with someone on the phone by introducing a “call back” option 

• we are harnessing the power of machine learning to help our teams prioritize the most pressing requests 

our other marketplaces also require similar member support activities and we believe our experience can be leveraged across our brands to help drive their future growth and customer satisfaction

etsy new seller gms retention 



in the above tables each new seller cohort includes the aggregate gms from all sellers that created and were billed for their first listing on etsycom in the designated year the gms retention rate reflects the gms generated by each cohort as a percentage of the total gms generated by that cohort in their initial year the gms for each seller is calculated from the date of their first listing fee such that “year 1” represents the gms within 365 days of their first listing fee as a result we do not yet have a full “year 2” data set for the 2020 new seller cohort as sellers who incurred their first listing fee later in 2020 have not yet had two years to age 

in addition to the growth in gms per seller as outlined earlier in this section this seller cohort data shows that newer vintage seller cohorts on the etsy platform are generating more gms in their first year on the platform than prior vintage seller cohorts and that all seller cohorts are retaining more gms in subsequent years 

etsy buyers 

the etsy marketplace supports a community of approximately 90 million buyers who value selfexpression unique items and buying directly from creative artisans and entrepreneurs etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with etsy sellers they can also purchase customized items vintage merchandise and craft supplies from etsy sellers by shopping on the etsy marketplace etsy buyers are supporting creative artisans and entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world we are focused on driving more new buyers to the platform and driving engagement so they purchase more often 

the covid19 pandemic and other global macroeconomic factors were catalysts for significant change in how buyers engage with etsycom below we provide detail supporting our belief that we have been able to retain much of the positive impact we’ve seen from the dramatic adoption of ecommerce during the past two years the “pandemic cohort” has been sticky  53 of all buyers who made a purchase on the etsy marketplace in 2020 made another purchase in 2021 and 37 of new buyers in 2020 made a purchase in 2021 

for the etsy marketplace our number of active buyers  those buyers who have made a purchase within the trailing twelve months  has grown at a 282 compound annual growth rate cagr since 2017 as shown in the chart below 

gms per active buyer  we believe that one of the most useful ways to track the success of our efforts to drive buyer retention frequency and purchases is to look at gms per active buyer on a trailing twelve month basis you can see the progression of this metric for the etsycom marketplace below 

new buyers  we believe that we have a significant opportunity to attract those who have never shopped on etsycom before since a buyer is separately identified by a unique email address a buyer is considered new if they use a unique email address that has never been used for a purchase on the etsy marketplace during 2021 we had almost 35 million new etsycom buyers down 9 compared to 2020 while the growth in new buyers decelerated from the pandemicdriven peak levels achieved during 2020 new buyer acquisition remained meaningfully elevated when compared to prepandemic periods gms from new etsycom buyers was up 3 yearoveryear and represented approximately 13 of overall etsycom gms in 2021 



in the above tables each new buyer cohort includes the aggregate gms from all buyers that made their first purchase on etsycom in the designated year the gms retention rate reflects the gms purchased by each cohort as a percentage of the gms purchased by that cohort in their initial year each buyer’s gms is calculated from the date of their first purchase such that “year 1” represents the gms purchased by a buyer within 365 days of their first purchase as a result we do not yet have a full “year 2” data set for the 2020 new buyer cohort as buyers who bought later in 2020 have not had two years to age 

given the dramatic change in etsy’s business over the past two years we are providing a revised view of buyer retention than in our prior annual reports this view focuses on gms retention which we believe is the best way to evaluate etsy buyer behavior over a multiyear period the chart on the left above shows the retention of gms from new buyers as a percent of the gms from their first purchase year etsy has seen an uptick in gms retention for our older 2017 and 2018 cohorts and the 2019 cohort has started off with stronger gms retention than its predecessor cohorts the righthand chart shows the same gms retention rates and includes the first purchase year gms for each cohort this is the base from which the retention rate is calculated etsy’s product and marketing investments are focused on continuing to drive frequency among existing buyers which we believe leads to higher rates of gms retention over time 

reactivated buyers  we’ve also made significant strides in reactivating lapsed buyers generating purchases from buyers who hadn’t made a purchase in a year or more we had over 21 million reactivated buyers in 2021 a decrease of 4 compared to 2020 when we reactivated 22 million buyers while in 2021 the pool of lapsed buyers decreased the number of reactivated lapsed buyers remained very high compared to prepandemic levels we continue to see buyer reactivation as a key to our longterm growth because buyers often “lapse” in their etsycom purchases the strategies outlined above are intended to reengage buyers and build top of mind awareness and consideration 

repeat buyers repeat etsy buyers represent shoppers who made purchase s on two or more days in the previous 12 months we believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2021 on the etsy marketplace approximat ely 49 of our active buyers were repeat buyers representing continued steady improvement in this metric over the past few years the average number of times per year that buyers are purchasing has also increased  from 46 times per year in 2019 to 52 times per year in 2021 

habitual buyers we are particularly focused on converting our repeat buyers into habitual buyers or etsy buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months as of december 31 2021 habitual buyers grew to 81 million  an increase of 26 compared to 2020 the growth in habitual buyers is faster than overall active buyer growth indicating our efforts to convert buyers into more loyal shoppers on the etsy marketplace a re seeing meaningful signs of success growth in habitual buyers in nonus geographies is outpacing the us growth with 73 and 17 growth respectively from 2020 to 2021 habitual buyers represented approximately 45 of our gms in 2021 and we believe that focusing on creating more habitual buyers and building additional loyalty with these buyers is key to our future growth 

summary of active buyers by purchase type the below chart represents a summary of active buyer behavior according to the number of days they purchase and the amount they spend on etsy during a twelve month period 

our opportunity 

we believe that the nature of commerce is continuing to evolve more people are choosing to purchase goods online and many consumers are looking for special items as an alternative to mass produced goods further the covid19 pandemic has shifted behavior for buyers around the globe leading to a surge in ecommerce and accelerated digital transformation consumers are increasingly “going digital” providing and purchasing more goods and services online raising ecommerce’s share of global retail trade from approximately 138 in 2019 to approximately 196 in 2021 according to emarketer many anticipate that new shopping habits the continued rapid growth of mobile devices convenience wide selection and other factors will continue to drive shoppers to shop online more and more furthermore we believe that the lines between online and offline shopping are blurring for many consumers and that etsy has the opportunity to continue to gain share within the context of the broader retail marketplace we expect that our future success hinges on our ability to execute on the growth strategies outlined above bringing more buyers to the marketplace driving frequency of purchasing and the amount of spend on etsy 

in 2019 etsy conducted a market opportunity analysis at that time we estimated that the online market size across all relevant retail categories for the etsy marketplace within etsy’s then six core geographic markets united states united kingdom germany canada australia and france represented a 249 billion market opportunity and a 17 trillion market opportunity when offline is included included in this analysis of “relevant retail categories” was apparel and footwear beauty and personal care home and living craft supplies paper and party art and collectibles personal accessories and eyewear pet care and toys and games 

we recently updated this market opportunity analysis to incorporate the growth of ecommerce adoption over the past two years we now estimate that the online market size across all relevant retail categories for the etsy marketplace within our seven core geographic markets now including india represents a 466 billion market opportunity and a 20 trillion market opportunity when offline is included 

for the last few years the growth of the etsy marketplace has outpaced the growth of ecommerce and we have gained market share yet our 2021 etsy marketplace gms only represented approximately 26 of the online only portion outlined above we continue to focus on our goal of growing at a faster rate than ecommerce overall and on gaining share through further penetration of certain categories and driving frequency of purchases on etsy from existing and new buyers since our analysis is focused on our core geographies and retail categories additional upside to this opportunity could come from further geographic andor category expansion for etsycom 

in addition since our 2019 market opportunity analysis etsy has taken several important strategic actions that deepen or enhance our total market opportunity these include our purchases of reverb musical instruments depop expanding our apparel category opportunity into the resale sector and elo7 which brings etsy into the brazilian ecommerce market 

esg reporting our impact goals strategy  progress 

we have developed an impact strategy and goals that reflect the positive impact we want to have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy and we are pleased to provide this update on our progress 

our approach to impact reporting 

since announcing our impact strategy in 2017 we have continued to evolve and update many of our goals to be more specific measurable and time bound all while continuing to expand the transparency of our reporting on these activities we apply the same focus discipline and accountability to our impact metrics as we do our financial metrics and together they make us stronger and more resilient we expect to continue to use our required filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as our investor relations website and etsy news blog as our primary communications channels for information relating to our impact strategy and progress in this annual report etsy continues to report our impact metrics using the sustainability accounting standards board “sasb” and task force on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” frameworks reporting under the sasb and tcfd framework can be found on pages 3032 and 3336 respectively 

our “house of brands” 

we expect to continue to evolve our impact strategy and disclosures in the future as we grow and incorporate our recently acquired marketplaces into our environmental social and governance “esg” strategy and as our impact work matures except where specifically noted our discussion of impact and impact data includes the operations of our reverb marketplace but does not include the operations of depop or elo7 which were acquired in 2021 it is our intention to further integrate our new subsidiary brands in our esg reporting in the future 

transition to “esg” nomenclature 

in this report etsy has transitioned our impact reporting to the more commonly used environmental social and governance nomenclature we believe this change has provided us with an opportunity to take a fresh look at our focus areas will make it easier for our various stakeholders to track and interpret our progress and better align our reporting with emerging global standards below on page 19 please see a chart outlining our new framework and objectives across each esg pillar 



2021 impact highlights 

creating economic impact through entrepreneurship 

we are committed to growing sustainably by aligning our mission and business strategy to help create economic impact through entrepreneurship and therefore create value for all our stakeholders in 2021 etsy sellers contributed 143 billion to the us economy a 167 increase from our baseline of 537 billion in 2018 furthermore etsy sellers created 38 million jobs in the independent worker economy enough jobs to employ almost all of the city of los angeles california population 397 million and generated 38 billion in income etsy sellers produced over 8 billion in additional economic value by harnessing their creativity and bringing unique products to market 

 to calculate these results etsy commissioned its third economic impact study with econorthwest an independent economic consulting firm to explore the ways etsy sellers in the united states contribute to the national economic landscape 



how we drive impact 

underpinning our impact strategy is a set of levers we employ to achieve our ambitions 

business integration 

responsibility and accountability for implementing our impact strategy is integrated and owned across our company through many cross functional teams our impact strategy is approved annually by our executive team and each of our impact goals has an executive sponsor our board of directors also has oversight of these activities 

marketplace integration 

we are working to integrate our impact ambitions into how our marketplace platforms are designed and operated and how our sellers and buyers experience our marketplaces by making it easier for sellers and buyers to understand their personal and collective impact we aim to influence more sustainable practices on the seller side while helping buyers make more informed decisions we are building product features to enhance inclusivity and accessibility and we are conscious about using marketing data and marketing images in responsible and ethical ways 

valuesaligned resource allocation 

we’re putting our resources behind positive change to enable the communities we are a part of to thrive here are some examples 

philanthropy in 2021 we invested over 29 million in philanthropic donations including for covid19 relief to asian americans and pacific islanders “aapi” led organizations and to organizations driving access to opportunity in stem education and the technology industry 

contributing to our communities collectively etsy enabled employees to donate 2490 hours of paid volunteer time off in their communities through etsy’s impact hours program 

purchasing power we aim to drive positive impact in our supply chain by investing in strong relationships with our suppliers we engage on priority impact areas such as supplier diversity greenhouse gas emissions fair wages and employee benefits programs at crucial touch points throughout the supplier lifecycle we conduct regular reviews audits and conversations to confirm suppliers are upholding agreed upon practices and to identify further areas where we can engage with suppliers we have a supplier code of conduct designed to ensure that our suppliers are committed to our standards 

public policy  advocating for creative entrepreneurs and the planet 

we aim to leverage our engagement with policymakers to advance our commitments to economic empowerment for creative entrepreneurs equity and ecological sustainability a key aspect of this work is activating the power of our seller community during 2021 over 35000 etsy sellers advocated on these issues in the united states united kingdom and the european union and generated over 50000 messages to lawmakers on behalf of our community 

in 2021 we continued to advocate for public policies aligned with the needs of creative entrepreneurs including covid19 relief for the selfemployed and sole proprietors portable benefits support for the us postal service sensible platform regulation and economic justice policies to support microbusinesses operated by women indigenous community members and people of color we also took the following actions in support of policy solutions to help drive carbon reduction in the long term including advocating for national and regional policies with the potential to accelerate the decarbonization of the transportation sector and drive significant market transformation supporting national goalsetting efforts that stand to expand electrification infrastructure and increase environmental justice and continuing to collaborate with peers vendors and nongovernment organizations on industrywide efforts to drive efficiency and resilience in the shipping and logistics sector 



1 scope 1 emissions include direct emissions such as natural gas and refrigerants used at our facilities scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from the generation of electricity steam heating and cooling that we may purchase for our facilities scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in our value chain such as business travel employee commuting and the goods and services we purchase

the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures 

etsy treats climate change and its related impacts seriously as part of our deepening management of climate impacts in 2020 we began providing enhanced climaterelated disclosures using the recommendations of the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” as a guide the following section reflects our climatespecific reporting aligned with the tcfd while we have identified and disclosed a number of relevant climaterelated risks we have determined that at this time none of these risks represent a material shortterm risk to our business for a discussion of certain of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

tcfd provides a framework with four thematic areas — governance strategy risk management and metrics and targets — and eleven recommended disclosures the following disclosures provide information intended to address each recommendation including references to other publicly available sources for related information unless otherwise noted as relating to etsycom information in this section applies to etsy inc and all of its subsidiaries 

governance 

board of directors oversight of climaterelated risks  opportunities 

etsy’s full board of directors has overall responsibility for oversight of risk management at etsy including management of climate risk the charter of the nominating and corporate governance committee the “ncgc” of our board of directors provides that the ncgc has responsibility for periodic review of our environmental and social impact goals and our progress towards those goals we report on our progress towards our impact goals to the ncgc or the full board of directors two times a year the full board of directors also receives briefings generally quarterly on risk managementrelated topics including reports on the activities of etsy’s risk steering committee for a description of the risk steering committee’s activities see below the full board of directors is responsible for reviewing significant acquisitions and other large scale capital expenditures one of the criteria we use when evaluating acquisition opportunities is whether the transaction aligns with our mission strategy and values including our impact focus 

in addition the audit committee of the board of directors oversees the disclosure in our annual report which includes these climaterelated and impact disclosures and our auditor’s review of our impact disclosures one member of our board of directors is experienced in advancing sustainability accounting practices and is a sustainability accounting standards board “sasb” fsa credential holder information about etsy inc’s board of directors and its committees including their charters and membership is available in the governance section of our investor relations website 

management’s role in assessing and managing climaterelated risks and opportunities 

our executive team including our ceo and cfo review our environmental goals annually our cfo approves material capital expenditures including those related to climaterelated issues such as renewable energy projects and investments in verified emissions reductions 

oversight of climate risk at etsycom is supported by the risk steering committee a cross functional management team which includes our ceo and cfo this committee meets at least quarterly to review and discuss the significant risks facing etsycom including any material climaterelated risks and reports on those risks to the full board of directors 

etsy inc’s sustainability team led by the senior director of impact and sustainability the “is sr director” oversees etsy’s sustainability strategy and implementation which includes climate impacts the is sr director reports to the vp of workplace and strategic sourcing who reports to the chief operations strategy  people officer who is the executive sponsor for etsy’s impact strategy the is sr director presents progress on environmental metrics each quarter to the senior leadership team including the ceo and cfo the impact strategy coordination group a crossfunctional working group led by the is sr director coordinates esg strategy and initiatives and meets biweekly etsy also has four crossfunctional impact working groups that all meet at least quarterly to manage the implementation of impact projects and reporting 

etsycom engages employees from across the company on climate and esg topics through internal programming such as an external speaker series and office hours with the sustainability team the ceo includes climate progress updates in companywide presentations at least once per year ensuring all employees are aware of etsy’s sustainability priorities and initiatives 

strategy 

climaterelated risks and opportunities identified  impact on strategy 

etsy’s climate strategy is informed by periodic identification and prioritization of climaterelated risks and opportunities our 2021 etsycom climate impact analysis considered transition and physical impacts across seven key geographic markets and one key commodity and both our physical operations as well as the etsycom marketplace for transition impacts we reviewed clean energy transportation and lowcarbon building technologies and policies for physical impacts we evaluated a range of acute and chronic hazards several potential climate issues were initially identified through desk research peer benchmarking and workshops with experts across etsycom’s business including engineering fulfillment corporate strategic sourcing advocacy legal strategy and operations investor relations and research these issues were evaluated based on stakeholder awareness operational impact and strategic impact to determine the shortlist for further analysis 

our 2021 climate impact analysis did not identify any risks with material shortterm impact on financial or strategic business operations we believe that this is largely due to etsycom’s marketplace model the wide geographic distribution of our seller and buyer base and our longstanding work to mitigate climate risks however due to the systemic nature of climate change and its intensifying global impacts we are continuing to monitor and manage both climaterelated risks and opportunities 

the following disclosures highlight the identified climaterelated impacts as well as the ways in which our esg strategy seeks to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities we define shortterm impacts as those expected to occur within 02 years mediumterm impacts as those expected to occur within 25 years and longterm impacts as those expected to occur after 5 or more years etsy’s 2022 esg goalsetting process considered these climaterelated impacts 

identified climate opportunities  management response 



identified climate risks  management response 



resilience of strategy across different climaterelated scenarios 

to understand how our top climaterelated risks and opportunities might change under different temperature pathways over time in 2021 we engaged a consulting partner manifest climate to conduct a qualitative scenario analysis across seven key geographic markets as part of this process exposure pathways were mapped for prioritized climaterelated issues based on etsycom’s business model data availability and internal stakeholder input manifest used a range of representative concentration pathway “rcp” scenarios with the lowest emissions scenario being rcp26 and the highest emission scenario being rcp85 as well as models and reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change “ipcc” to assess netzero transition impacts we leveraged policy insights from the international energy agency “iea” and inevitable policy response “ipr” available climate scenario inputs and results were then collated and overlaid with etsycom’s seller and buyer information in key geographies allowing the analysis to pinpoint areas of concern 

through this analysis we found that all key geographies are expected to face some degree of climate risk under different scenarios for example buyers and sellers in australia may be subject to more intense heat waves and wildfires while buyers and sellers in germany may be vulnerable to increasing frequency and severity of floods however because etsycom’s buyer and seller base is distributed globally we did not find climate risks in any one geography that disproportionately impact etsycom’s business under any scenario we aim to continue improving our data collection and analysis on these topics to update our strategic planning 

risk management 

processes for identifying and assessing climaterelated risks 

our climate risk identification and assessment process is integrated into our companywide risk management process our sustainability team including the is sr director and the senior sustainability manager engages with key business functions to identify and evaluate climate risks that could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the organization at least annually the sustainability team and internal subject matter experts analyze risks in the context of our business develop recommendations as appropriate and escalate them for oversight by senior management through etsy inc’s risk steering committee see governance in this section above for more detail for example the sustainability team collaborates with the advocacy team to review climate policy proposals at the federal and state level that might impact etsy and if relevant presents new climaterelated regulations that could increase etsy inc’s or its sellers’ operating costs to the risk steering committee the sustainability team also leverages data from the market research team to monitor the impact of weather events on seller operations 

processes for managing climaterelated risks 

the sustainability team works crossfunctionally to develop management plans to address potential climaterelated impacts they develop and propose updates to environmental goals on an annual basis including goals designed to mitigate climate risks which are reviewed and approved by our executive team for example our goal to source 100 renewable electricity for office operations and computing load which was achieved for 2020 reduces our exposure to carbon pricing and increased fossil fuel costs the sustainability team developed the goal proposed shortterm targets and strategies to measure and reach those targets and solicited approval from the executive team who ensured resources were provisioned and lines of accountability were appropriately set see the strategy section above for a discussion of actions taken in response to other identified climate risks 

processes for integrating climaterelated risks into the overall risk management 

at etsy inc climaterelated risks are included within esg risks and are seen as underlying drivers of other types of risks these risks as well as their drivers are monitored by the risk steering committee the is sr director provides a written status update on potential esg risks including climate risks to etsy’s risk steering committee every two months and presents to the risk steering committee as needed the work of the risk steering committee helps inform which risks are reported to the board of directors 

metrics and targets 

metrics used to assess climaterelated risks and opportunities in line with strategy and risk management process 

we monitor metrics related to total energy consumed renewable energy percent grid electricity percent total ghg footprint of scope 1 2 and 3 emissions including product shipments packaging enduser energy use water and outgoing waste material streams for a historical view of our metrics please view pages 3032 of this annual report 

since 2019 etsycom has been a carbon neutral business offsetting 100 of our unabated carbon emissions across all measured scope 1 2 and 3 categories each year our commitment to maintain carbon neutrality effectively acts as an internal price on our emissions creating a financial incentive to support business decisions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from driving operational efficiencies to integrating sustainability into our procurement process 

we continue to act in support of solutions that will help drive carbon reduction in the long term including advocating at the federal and state level for comprehensive climate and carbon reduction policies and collaborating with peers on industrywide efforts to drive efficiency and resilience in the shipping and logistics sector 

for all of our teams compensation is tied to the company’s financial performance as well as individual contributions while responsibility for delivering on our impact goals is distributed across the company each goal owner is responsible for incorporating work associated with advancing their goal into team members’ individual goals which is in turn directly tied to compensation members of our executive team also serve as executive sponsors for specific impact goals to help ensure teams stay on track and have the value of executive leadership as plans are executed 

scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and the related risks 

please view pages 2223 and 3032 of this annual report for our ghg emissions summary 

targets used to manage climaterelated risks and opportunities and performance against targets 

etsy has five climaterelated targets sciencebased emissions reduction carbon neutrality renewable energy total energy use and waste details of these targets including actions taken to achieve them and performance against each can be found on pages 2223 of this annual report 

competition 

for all of our marketplaces sellers may choose to list their goods for sale with online retailers or sell their goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram they may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover their goods in our marketplaces or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling sellers to sell from their own website or otherwise run their business independently of our platforms we are able to compete for sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our marketplaces and the breadth of our online presence our meaningful investments in marketing that benefit our sellers and their growth the number and engagement of our buyers our seller tools and services our seller education resources our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers of all shapes and sizes for the attention of our buyers a buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces national retail chains local consignment and vintage stores resale marketplaces or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for buyers based on the unique goods that sellers list in our marketplaces our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience customer service our reputation for trustworthiness the positive impact buyers can make by shopping from the creative entrepreneurs on our platform our mobile apps the availability of fair and free shipping offered by sellers ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws including patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws in the united states and abroad we also use confidentiality procedures defensive licensing and acquisitions nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect us and our intellectual property 

we file patents and register domain names trademarks copyrights and service marks in the united states and abroad we rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks we also use internal and external brand protection mechanisms that are intended to protect our brands from misuse by third parties 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant amounts of management time and focus in addition in both the united states and abroad laws and regulations relating to the liability of online marketplaces for activities of their sellers and other third parties are being tested by a number of proceedings 

laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example federal and state laws in the united states eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments and consumer protection other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country 

we are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of consumer information our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use storage transmission and disclosure of personal information including buyer and seller data any failure by us to comply with our policies or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others which could harm our business 

many jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement this growing focus on data privacy and regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on sellers and could subject us to significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business further any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy and data of our sellers and buyers could result in a loss of confidence in our marketplaces which could adversely affect our business 

in addition some of these requirements may introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platforms and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact our business and future outlook additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws noncompliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability see part i item ia “risk factors — regulatory compliance and legal risks” 

seasonality 

etsycom sellers experience increased sales and use more services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased gms and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower gms and revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2021 decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quartertoquarter for all periods within 2021 other than the first quarter of 2021 generally corresponding to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue and gms growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results

we experienced rapid growth in our business in the number of buyers and sellers and purchase frequency during 2020 our revenue growth may not be sustainable while our growth continued in 2021 our rate of growth decelerated as compared to the rapid growth we experienced in 2020 which was driven at least in part by the pandemicrelated shift to online purchasing even if our revenue continues to grow we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future in addition our costs may increase as we continue to invest in the development of our marketplaces including our services and technological enhancements and as we increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and hire additional employees further the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational compliance payments and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial compliance payments and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures to support our current and future growth 

our rapid growth has made and may continue to make us a more attractive target to bad actors and fraudsters targeting our marketplaces and our communities civil litigants and those seeking to enforce often questionable intellectual property rights our increased visibility has led and may continue to lead to attempts to misrepresent or mischaracterize us or our marketplaces such as on social media or via individual or coordinated campaigns we may not be successful in defending against these types of claims which if successful could damage our brands and our business even if we are successful in defending against these types of claims we may be required to spend significant resources in those efforts which may distract our management and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations in addition the recent increased scrutiny and regulation of marketplace platforms even though focused on other large platforms has and may continue to create burdens on both etsy and its communities of buyers and sellers this may lead to increased risks that shift more quickly than our policies enforcement mechanisms and systems can react 

if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed in addition our revenue may decline and our revenue growth rate may continue to decelerate for a number of reasons including the abatement of the covid19 pandemic and other factors described elsewhere in these risk factors for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—revenue” you should not rely on growth rates of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 

the unprecedented ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted our gms and results of operations and the pandemic may continue to impact our gms or our results of operations in numerous volatile and unpredictable ways 

uncertainty caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted and may to continue to impact the global economy ecommerce at large and global macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending while covid19 vaccination efforts are ongoing the timing speed acceptance and efficacy of vaccinations along with the imposition of movement restrictions and closures vary from location to location is evolving and to varying degrees across locations still remains unpredictable in addition the covid19 pandemic and related government and private sector responsive actions have affected the broader economies and financial markets and have at points adversely affected and could again adversely affect demand for products sold in our marketplaces it is impossible to predict all the effects and the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic as the situation continues to evolve the covid19 pandemic has also disrupted the global supply chain and various preventative and protective measures currently in place or which may be instituted or reinstituted in the future such as quarantines closures and movement restrictions may interfere with the ability of our sellers to deliver products to our buyers if delivery services are delayed or shut down or become more expensive our gms and revenue could be negatively impacted 

our results of operations may be materially affected by adverse conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the united states and internationally uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of 

discretionary items across all of our product categories and demand for products available in our marketplaces may be reduced our results of operations have also been positively impacted by several trends related to the covid19 pandemic including the shift from offline to online shopping fast moving dynamics in the ecommerce space retail business closures and reopenings stimulus checks and “stay at home” practices or mandates however we have seen demand for certain items like handmade masks diminish significantly with the rollout of vaccines and as medical grade masks became more widely available it is also difficult to predict how our business might be impacted by changing consumer spending patterns as the pandemic runs its course as pandemicrelated restrictions on movement ease competition may intensify as buyers return to traditional brick and mortar retail stores additionally our sales may decline if pentup demand for other discretionary spending replaces demand for online shopping other factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make discretionary purchases include among others levels of employment interest and core inflation rates tax rates housing costs the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and any future stimulus checks in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession significant inflation or increased supply chain shortages impacting our communities of sellers and the economy as a whole consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected gms revenue net income and adjusted ebitda 

as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic our employees remain almost fully remote and a significant number will continue to work remotely as we transition to a hybrid work model it is possible that these arrangements could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations if a natural disaster power outage connectivity issue or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely were to occur it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time the increase in remote working for employees vendors or contractors may also result in increased consumer privacy it security and fraud concerns further as certain businesses return to onsite operations and we transition to a hybrid work model we may experience disruptions if our employees or thirdparty service providers’ employees become ill despite the availability of vaccines and are unable to perform their duties such disruptions may impact our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers 

the uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions and the lifting or imposition of travel restrictions in the united states and other areas of the world and consumers’ responses to these developments may adversely impact the national andor global economy and negatively impact consumer discretionary spending even in the ecommerce space which experienced growth during the initial phases of the pandemic the full extent of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on our operations key metrics and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable including the timing acceptance and efficacy of vaccinations and possible achievement of herd immunity in various locations the timing of further relaxation elimination or imposition of movement and travel restrictions the occurrence of virus mutations and variants the pandemic’s impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the virus vaccines and containment all of which may vary across regions any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and ability to execute and capitalize on our strategies 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control including 

• fluctuations in gms or revenue including as a result of uncertainty or changing spending patterns resulting from the covid19 pandemic the impact or the waning of the impact of any government actions the seasonality of market transactions and our sellers’ use of services 

• our ability to convert marketplace visits into sales for our sellers 

• the amount and timing of our operating expenses 

• our success in attracting and retaining sellers and buyers 

• our success in executing on our strategy and the impact of any changes in our strategy 

• the timing and success of product launches including new services and features we may introduce 

• the success of our marketing efforts 

• the success of our acquired businesses such as depop and elo7 each of which we acquired in july 2021 and reverb which we acquired in 2019 

• our ability to integrate depop and elo7 and implement our “house of brands” strategy 

• adverse economic and market conditions including those related to the current covid19 pandemic currency fluctuations rapidly rising inflation and adverse global events 

• disruptions or defects in our marketplaces such as privacy or data security breaches errors in our software or other incidents that impact the availability reliability or performance of our platforms 

• the impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments 

• our ability to manage our business and future growth and 

• our ability to recruit and retain employees 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results key metrics and the price of our common stock may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment due to the uncertainty caused by and the unprecedented nature of the current covid19 pandemic consumer spending patterns and the impacts of reopening of the offline economy and lessening or elimination of restrictions on movement fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate and the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on quartertoquarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results which would cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time we release earnings guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls quarterly and annual earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release for example we historically have provided annual guidance but we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance on april 2 2020 given the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic and have been providing only quarterly guidance since 

on february 24 2022 we provided guidance for the first quarter of 2022  this guidance includes forwardlooking statements based on projections prepared by our management projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are based on information known when they are issued and while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies relating to our business many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change some of those key assumptions include the impact of the covid19 pandemic and its duration particularly as sarscov2 variants spread covid19 vaccines and therapies become widely available and restrictions on movement are lifted or reinstated future consumer spending patterns and the associated economic uncertainty on our business these assumptions are inherently difficult to predict particularly in the long term in addition we completed the acquisition of elo7 on july 2 2021 and depop on july 12 2021 while all guidance is necessarily speculative in nature guidance relating to the anticipated results of operations of a recently acquired business is inherently more speculative in nature than other guidance as management will necessarily be less familiar with the business procedures and operations of the recently acquired business it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions regarding depop and elo7 underlying any guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges furthermore analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business which may form a consensus about our future performance our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the impacts of reduced movement or the removal of restrictions on movement which could adversely affect our business and future operating results there are no comparable recent events that provide insights on the probable effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we are relying on the reports and models of economic and medical experts in making assumptions relating to the duration of this crisis lifting or imposition of restrictions on movement in various regions and predictions as to timing and pace of any future economic recovery if these models are incorrect or incomplete or if we fail to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing covid19 pandemic will have on all aspects of our business or the duration of those impacts the guidance and other forwardlooking statements we provide may also be incorrect or incomplete furthermore if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts investors or other interested parties the price of our common stock could decline 

given the uncertainty surrounding the impacts and duration of the covid19 pandemic the efficacy of vaccines the impacts of current or new variants of the sarscov2 virus and the timing and impact of the easing or reimposition of restrictions on movement we may continue to provide more limited quarterly guidance as we did in 2020 and 2021 guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not 

materialize or will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this risk factors section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material 

if we experience a technology disruption or failure that results in a loss of information if personal data or sensitive information about members of our communities or employees is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are unable to protect against software and hardware vulnerabilities service interruptions cyber incidents ransomware security incidents or security breaches then members of our communities may curtail use of our platforms we may be exposed to liability or incur additional expenses and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services we are vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins intentional or accidental actions or inactions by employees or others with authorized access to our networks phishing attacks denialofservice attacks ransomware and other cyber incidents any of these occurrences could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of one or more of our platforms loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personal or financial information of our members or employees as we grow our business expand internationally and gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we have integrated a variety of recovery systems security protocols network protection mechanisms and other security measures into our systems networks and physical facilities which are designed to protect against detect and minimize security breaches including security testing encryption of sensitive information and authentication technology we cannot assure you that such measures will be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption system failure data loss or theft or other material adverse consequences particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers organized cyber criminals and cyber terrorists while we are investing in recovery systems security and access controls and assessments of our vendors’ security for us and our recently acquired subsidiaries these systems and controls are not yet fully in place and even when in place have not always been in the past and in the future may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a cyber attack system failure or security breach 

in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future technology disruptions cyber incidents and security breaches including intentional inadvertent or social engineering breaches occurring through our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers as in the past if our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers fail to comply with our internal security policies and practices member or employee data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

our security and access controls for our systems may not be adequate which may heighten the risk of a cyber attack or security breach among other things our applications systems networks software and physical facilities could have material vulnerabilities be breached or the personal or confidential information that we store could be otherwise compromised due to employee error or malfeasance if for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or our members to disclose information or user names andor passwords or otherwise compromise the security of our networks systems andor physical facilities as in the past employees or service providers may inadvertently misconfigure resources or misdirect certain communications in manners that may lead to security incidents on which we must then expend effort and expenses to correct 

we moved to a fully remote work environment due to the covid19 pandemic and are transitioning to a hybrid work environment where a portion of our workforce will remain fully remote in addition the industry is generally moving to online remote infrastructure for core work as a result we and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property or user data 

a successful cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected because the techniques used by hackers change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition because any investigation of a cybersecurity incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators members of our communities and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident applicable rules regarding how to respond required notices to users and reporting to regulators vary by jurisdiction and may subject etsy to additional liability and reputational harm 

our production systems rely on internal technology along with cloud services and software provided by our thirdparty service providers and other entities in our supply chain in the event of a cyberincident even partial unavailability of our production systems could impair our ability to serve our customers manage transactions or operate our marketplaces we have implemented disaster recovery mechanisms including systems to back up key data and production systems but these systems may be inadequate or incomplete for example these disaster recovery systems may be susceptible to cyberincidents if not 

sufficiently separated from primary systems not comprehensive or not at a scale sufficient to replace our primary systems insufficient production and disaster recovery systems could in the event of a cyberincident harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted marketplaces 

the costs and effort to respond to a security breach andor to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions delays cessation of service negative publicity and other harm to our business and our competitive position we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices in response to a security breach or related regulatory actions or litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers and other entities in our supply chain experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss compromise or unauthorized disclosure of personal data or other sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing sellers and buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face damage to our reputation potential liability regulatory investigations in multiple jurisdictions and costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by and which may impact our future access to insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted marketplaces 

we are also reliant on the security practices of our third party service providers which may be outside of our direct control additionally some of our third party service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to payment card information and other confidential and sensitive member data we may have contractual and regulatory obligations to supervise the security and privacy practices of our thirdparty service providers despite our best efforts if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or as has occurred from time to time in the past experience a cyber incident or attack such as a breach of their networks our members’ data may be rendered unavailable improperly accessed used or disclosed more generally our thirdparty service providers may not have adequate security and privacy controls may not properly exercise their compliance regulatory or notification requirements including as to personal data or may not have the resources to properly respond to an incident many of our service providers continue to operate in a partial or fully remote work environment and may as a result be more vulnerable to cyber attacks consequently a security incident at any of such service providers or others in our supply chain could result in the loss compromise or unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive or personal data of our buyers or sellers 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platforms is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we frequently release software code to our platforms for the etsy marketplace platform we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platforms which can impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplaces additionally due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platforms updates to parts of our code third party code and apis on which we rely and that maintain the functionality of our marketplaces and business could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platforms that negatively impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplaces in some cases such as our mobile apps errors may only be correctable through updates distributed through slower third party mechanisms such as app stores and may need to comply with third party policies and procedures to be made available which may add additional delays due to app review and user delay in updating their mobile apps in addition our systems are increasingly reliant on machine learning systems which are complex and may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable these systems may inadvertently reduce the efficiency of our systems or may cause unintentional or unexpected outputs that are incorrect do not match our business goals do not comply with our policies or otherwise are inconsistent with our brands guiding principles and mission any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could also result in damage to our reputation loss of members of our communities loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

we rely on google cloud for a substantial portion of the computing storage data processing networking and other services for etsycom 

google cloud platform provides a distributed computing infrastructure as a service platform for business operations and we have migrated etsycom’s primary production environment and data centers to google cloud increasing our reliance on cloud infrastructure any transition of the cloud services currently provided by google cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and would cause us to incur significant time and expense our products and services are in significant part reliant on continued access to and the continued stability reliability and flexibility of google cloud any significant disruption of or interference with our use of google cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed in addition if hosting costs increase over time and if we require more computing or storage capacity our costs could increase disproportionately if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of google or similar providers our business and financial condition could be adversely affected reverb depop and elo7 rely on amazon web services for some business operations and those marketplaces are thus subject to analogous risks 

the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections within our communities are important to our success if we are unable to retain our existing buyers and sellers and activate new ones our financial performance could decline 

we are focused on ensuring that our marketplaces embody our mission and values and that we deliver trust and reliability throughout the buyer and seller experiences our reputation and brands depend in part upon our ability to maintain trustworthy marketplaces and also upon our sellers the quality of their offerings their adherence to our policies and their ability to deliver a trusted purchasing experience we view the trustworthiness and reliability of our marketplaces as well as the connections we foster in our buyerseller communities to be cornerstones of our business and key to our success many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

• complaints or negative publicity about us our platforms or our policies and guidelines even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents 

• an inability to gain the trust of prospective buyers 

• disruptions or defects in our marketplaces privacy or data security incidents website outages payment disruptions or other incidents that impact the reliability of our platforms 

• lack of awareness of our policies or confusion about how they are applied 

• changes to our policies that members of our communities perceive as inconsistent with their best interests or our mission or that are not clearly articulated 

• inadequacies in our house rules or terms of use 

• frequent product launches updates and experiments that could deteriorate member trust 

• a failure to enforce our policies effectively consistently and transparently including for example by allowing the repeated widespread listing of prohibited items in our marketplaces 

• inadequate or unsatisfactory customer service experiences 

• a failure on the part of our sellers to fulfill their orders in accordance with our policies their own shopspecific policies or buyer expectations 

• a failure to respond to feedback from our communities or 

• a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our guiding principles and mission 

creating trusted brands is one of the key elements of our strategy in particular we are focused on enhancing the customer experience for both sellers and buyers we continue to evolve our offerings and invest to improve our customer experience on our marketplaces if our efforts are unsuccessful or if our customer service platforms or our trust and safety program fail to meet our requirements legal requirements or our customers’ requirements we may need to quickly invest significant additional resources if we are unable to do so our ability to maintain trustworthy marketplaces attract buyers and sellers and maintain our trusted brands could be harmed 

our business financial performance and growth depends on our ability to attract and retain active and engaged communities of buyers and sellers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active buyers and active sellers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers and buyer engagement as well as the number of active sellers and seller engagement if we are not successful in encouraging buyers to return to us and purchase items in our marketplaces more frequently and sellers to list items for sale and use our services our financial performance may be negatively impacted 

our gms and revenue is concentrated in our most active buyers and sellers the early part of the pandemic fueled an unprecedented increase in the growth of new buyers and reactivated lapsed buyers although in recent quarters we have seen the growth rate decline on a yearoveryear basis we have also seen a higher than recent historic grow th rate of new sellers if we lose a significant number of those buyers or sellers due to the abatement of pandemic restrictions increased seller fees or otherwise our financial performance and growth could be harmed even if we are able to attract new buyers and sellers to replace the ones that we lose we may not be able to do so at recent levels they may not maintain the same level of activity and the gms and revenue generated from new buyers and sellers may not be as high as the gms and revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplaces if we are unable to retain existing buyers and sellers and attract new buyers and sellers who contribute to active communities our business financial performance and growth could be harmed 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our marketplaces is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures or due to other macro events if demand for the goods that our sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain our buyers and our business could be harmed a shift in trends away from sociallyconscious consumerism secondhand fashio n or unique or vintage goods could also make it more difficult to attract new buyers and sellers our growth would also be harmed if the shift from brick and mortar retail to ecommerce does not continue or reverses when the covid19 pandemic abates we believe that many new buyers and sellers find us by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing buyers and sellers if existing buyers do not find our platforms appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of competitive shipping costs delayed shipping times inadequate customer service lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by our sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us likewise if existing sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platforms or feel they have more attractive alternatives they may stop listing items in our marketplaces and using our services and may stop referring others to us under any of these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new buyers and sellers without incurring additional expense 

we rely on our sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to our buyers 

a small portion of buyers complain to us about their experience on our platforms as a pure marketplace our sellers manage their shops most policies products and product descriptions shipping and returns as a result we may not have the ability to control important aspects of buyers’ experiences on our platforms for example buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by a seller or that a seller has not been responsive to their questions similarly we occasionally identify sellers who are unable to fulfill orders in a time frame or manner consistent with buyer expectations popular or trending sellers may experience an influx of orders that may be beyond their ability to fulfill in a timely manner while we have procedures designed to mitigate spikes in orders we cannot guarantee those procedures will be effective 

negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints or any associated enforcement action taken against sellers could reduce our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers or damage our reputation we take action against sellers who we are aware may have violated our policies however our actions may be insufficient may not be timely and may not be effective in creating a good purchase experience for our buyers or avoiding negative publicity 

as our marketplaces grow our controls over fraud and policy violations are important to maintaining user trust but they may not be adequate and may not be sufficient to keep up with quicklyshifting techniques used by those attempting to undertake fraudulent activity on our platforms while we regularly update our processes for handling complaints and detecting policy violations these processes are by their nature imperfect in a dynamic quickly growing marketplace and include risk to us our sellers and our buyers from both underenforcement and overenforcement 

a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for our sellers and buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse our buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation while we take steps such as requiring reserves including to cover such reimbursements from some sellers based on indicia they may not be able to fulfill orders we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements when we do recover funds used to reimburse buyers from sellers it may increase general seller dissatisfaction and reduce their desire to continue selling using our platforms although we are focused on enhancing customer service our efforts may be unsuccessful and our sellers and buyers may be disappointed in their experience and not return 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to our buyers could harm our sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of our sellers such as interruptions in 

order or payment processing interruptions in sellers’ supply chain transportation disruptions customs delays natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest for example a number of countries continue to experience delays in shipping due to the covid19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions and shipping delays may become more widespread if buyers have a negative purchase experience whether due to delay or other reasons our reputation could be damaged 

our business depends on third party services and technology which we utilize to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platforms and our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon a number of thirdparty service providers such as cloud service providers marketing platforms and providers payments and shipping providers and contingent labor teams and network and mobile infrastructure providers any disruption in their services any failure on their part to deliver their services in accordance with our scale and expectations or any failure on our part to maintain appropriate oversight on these thirdparty providers during the course of our engagement with them could significantly harm our business 

we are unable to exercise significant oversight over some of these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide such as technical failures deprecation of key services privacy or security concerns our efforts to update our infrastructure or supply chain may not be successful as we may not sufficiently distribute our risk across providers or geographies or our efforts to do so may take longer than anticipated if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or supply chain or do not expand our technology infrastructure or supply chain successfully then our ability to run our marketplaces could be significantly impacted which could harm our business 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to third party services platforms and infrastructure that we rely upon to maintain and scale our platforms 

our sellers and buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplaces internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platforms or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platforms in addition we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

outside of the united states governments of one or more countries have in the past and may continue to seek to censor content available on our platforms attempt to apply their local requirements extraterritorially or may even attempt to block access to our platforms if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

in addition our sellers rely on continued and unimpeded access to postal services and shipping carriers to deliver their goods reliably and timely to buyers as a result of the covid19 pandemic and other factors our sellers have experienced increased delays in delivery of their goods if these shipping delays continue or worsen or if shipping rates increase significantly our sellers may have increased costs andor our buyers may have a poor purchasing experience and may lose trust in our marketplaces which could negatively impact our business financial performance and growth 

our payments systems have both operational and compliance risks including inhouse execution risk dependency on thirdparty providers and a complex landscape of evolving laws regulations rules and standards 

the payment offerings provided on each of our marketplaces differ and as such are subject to varying degrees and types of risk in particular each payment offering has a different level of reliance on third parties to perform certain aspects of its services we plan to invest ongoing internal resources into our payments tools and infrastructure to maintain existing availability expand into additional markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers if we fail to invest adequate resources into our payments platforms or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable our payments services may not function properly keep pace with competitive offerings or comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements any of which could negatively impact their usage and our marketplaces as well as our trusted brands which in turn could adversely affect our gms and results of operations 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform key components of our payments platforms including payments processing and payments disbursing compliance currency exchange identity verification sanctions screening tax collection and fraud analysis if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to change or terminate it could negatively affect our sellers’ ability to receive orders or payments our buyers’ ability to complete purchases and our ability to operate our payments program including maintaining certain compliance measures including fraud prevention and detection tools this could decrease revenue increase costs lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our brands and business if we or a thirdparty payment processor suffer a security breach affecting payment card information we could be subjected to fines penalties and assessments arising out of the major card brands’ rules and 

regulations contractual indemnification obligations or other obligations contained in merchant agreements and similar contracts and we may lose our ability to accept payment cards as payment for our services and our sellers’ goods and services 

in addition we and our thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that negatively impact payments on our platforms we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such paymentsrelated service outages and if we are unable to promptly remedy or provide an alternative payment solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses or those of our sellers could increase and it could negatively impact our sellers’ businesses or our business 

further our ability to expand our payments services into additional countries is dependent upon the thirdparty providers we use to support these services as we expand the availability of our payments services to additional markets or offer new payment methods to our sellers and buyers in the future we along with our sellers may become subject to additional and evolving regulations compliance requirements and may be exposed to heightened fraud risk which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses 

various laws and regulations govern payments and these laws are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally moreover even in regions where such laws have been harmonized regulatory interpretations of such laws may differ as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort determining whether various licensing and registration laws relating to payments apply to us as our business strategy and operations evolve in addition should one of our subsidiaries become regulated as a financial services entity in any jurisdiction we would be subject to additional regulation any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources result in liabilities cause us significant reputational damage or force us to stop offering our payments services in certain markets additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments systems noncompliant andor less profitable 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payments service providers we are and could be subject to evolving rules and certification requirements including for example the payment card industry data security standard or other contractual requirements that may materially negatively impact our payments business failure to comply with these rules and requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines or negatively impact our relationship with our thirdparty payments processors 

we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements including as a result of a change in our designation by major payment card providers could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply and could require a change in our business operations in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules or payment card provider rules could lead to increased fees for us or our sellers which may negatively impact payments on our platforms usage of our payments services and our marketplaces 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns inflation natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic political crises geopolitical changes or other macroeconomic conditions which have in the past and may in the future negatively impact our business and financial performance 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available on our platforms may be reduced this would cause our marketplace and services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and we have seen significant and rapid shifts in consumer purchasing behavior as this pandemic has evolved particularly as it relates to items sought on etsy other factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make discretionary purchases include among others levels of employment interest and core inflation rates tax rates housing costs the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and any future stimulus checks it is difficult to predict how our business might be impacted by changing consumer spending patterns 

if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of sellers offering their goods in our marketplaces and the number of goods listed in our marketplaces could decline in addition currency exchange rates may directly and indirectly impact our business if the us dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies particularly if there is short term volatility our foreign currency denominated gms and revenue when translated into us dollars could fluctuate significantly currency exchange rates may also dampen demand for crossborder purchases which could impact gms and revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 74 of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

any events causing significant disruption or distraction to the public or to our workforce such as natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises supply chain disruptions political instability or crises terrorist attacks war social unrest or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers these events if they occur may impact buyer demand for discretionary goods impact sellers’ ability to run their businesses on our marketplaces and ship their goods and impact our ability to execute on our strategy any of which could negatively impact our business and financial performance 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

• complying with different and sometimes conflicting laws and regulatory standards particularly including those related to the use and disclosure of personal information online payments and money transmission intellectual property product liability consumer protection online platform liability ecommerce marketplace regulation labor and employment laws business practices including those related to the environment and taxation of income goods and services sometimes with attempts to apply these laws and regulatory standards extraterritorially 

• defending our marketplaces against international litigation including in jurisdictions that may not offer judicial norms or protections similar to those found in the united states 

• conforming to local business or cultural norms 

• barriers to international trade such as tariffs customs or other taxes or when applicable crossborder limits placed on us technology companies 

• uncertainties on the continuing impact of pandemicrelated quarantines closures delayed or shut down delivery services supply chain delays and movement restrictions on operations and geopolitical events such as natural disasters pandemics terrorism and acts of war 

• varying levels of internet ecommerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure 

• potentially heightened risk of fraudulent or other illegal transactions 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds 

• exposure to liabilities under anticorruption antimoney laundering and export control laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the uk bribery act of 2010 trade controls and sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control of the us treasury department and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

• our ability to enforce contracts our terms of use and policies and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states 

• fluctuations of foreign exchange rates and 

• uncertainties and instability in uk and eu markets caused by ongoing negotiations of crossborder service agreements triggered by brexit 

our sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if our sellers are not our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to recruit and retain a diverse group of employees and retain key employees is important to our success significant attrition or turnover could impact our ability to grow our business 

our ability to attract retain and motivate a diverse group of employees including our management team is important to our success we strive to attract retain and motivate our employees from our office administrators to our engineers to our management team who share our dedication to our communities and our mission to “keep commerce human” we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the number or caliber of employees we need to maintain our competitive position particularly in the uncertainty of the current macroeconomic environment we may not meet our impact goal of building diverse and inclusive workforces that are broadly representative of their communities 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

• skepticism regarding our ability to accelerate gms growth in the future 

• continuing ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits 

• evolving expectations regarding the ability to work remotely 

• enhancing engagement levels among existing employees and supporting their worklife balance 

• attracting high quality talent in a timely fashion 

• retaining qualified employees who support our mission and guiding principles including employees of recently acquired companies such as depop and elo7 and continuing to do so in a remote or hybrid work environment 

• continuing to find promotion opportunities to retain key employees for leadership positions 

• hiring employees in multiple locations globally and building a diverse equitable and inclusive workforce and 

• responding to competitive pressures and changing business conditions in ways that do not divert us from our guiding principles 

filling key strategic roles including engineering and product management particularly in new york city san francisco dublin and chicago is challenging and may be challenging in london são paulo and mexico city as well as competition for engineering talent continues to increase rapidly qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop retain and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines particularly in this volatile macroeconomic environment it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 

most of our employees are currently working on a fully remote or very nearly fully remote basis even though we have started to reopen our offices as we continue reopening our offices we are planning to migrate towards a hybrid work model in which some of our employees will remain fully remote and others will return to our offices with a flexible schedule if our needs are not aligned with our employees’ preferences it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain employees if we continue to operate with most of our employees located outside of our offices such arrangements may negatively impact our company culture 

in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief technology officer or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business further if members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties we may not be able to execute on our business strategy andor our operations may be negatively impacted other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

if we experience increased voluntary attrition in the future andor if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees in a timely fashion or on reasonable terms particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed 

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of copyright trademark and patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions we also rely on trade secret protection for parts of our technology and intellectual property the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property patent filings may not be adequate alone to protect our intellectual property and may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies from time to time we acquire intellectual property from third parties but these acquired assets like our internally developed intellectual property may be held invalid be unenforceable or may otherwise not be effective in protecting our platforms 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even when we do detect violations we have in the past and may in the future need to engage in litigation use of takedowns and similar procedures or licensing to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world particularly as to technologies used in ecommerce and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights our business could be harmed 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the united states and in numerous other foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense including indirect taxes based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable or likely settlements of tax audits we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including tax collection obligations due to changes in tax law such as digital services taxes or online sales taxes in 2021 the administration of president joseph r biden as well as several members 

of congress through the fiscal budget reconciliation process released proposed legislation that includes several significant modifications to key income tax provisions as well as introduced new provisions to the us internal revenue code the proposed legislation includes among other things an increase to us tax on certain foreign earnings an increase to the limitation of deductible interest expense and an increase to the disallowance of a deduction for certain named executive officers’ compensation although it is uncertain if some or all of the identified provisions will be enacted a change in us tax law would likely materially and adversely impact our income tax liability deferred tax asset or liability balances provision for income taxes and effective tax rate we may also be subject to increased requirements for marketplaces to report collect remit and hold liability for their customers’ direct and indirect tax obligations or as a result of changes to regulations administrative practices outcomes of court cases and changes to the global tax framework our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by results of our business operations including changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions acquisitions investments entry into new geographies the relative amount of foreign earnings changes in foreign currency exchanges rates changes in our stock price intercompany transactions changes to accounting rules expectation of future profits changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our assessment of their realizability and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in the ordinary course of our business there are numerous transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our tax positions and related provisions reflected in the financial statements are fully supportable we recognize that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates our effective tax rate can be adversely affected 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding its filing positions timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differs from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and tax liabilities 

at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we could be subject to higher than anticipated tax liabilities as well as ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as audits close and exposures are reevaluated 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility while the indentures governing our outstanding convertible notes do not include material restrictions on our ability to pursue our business strategy our credit facility requires us to comply with and future debt instruments may require us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as disposing of assets completing mergers or acquisitions incurring additional indebtedness encumbering our properties or assets paying dividends making other distributions or repurchasing our common stock making specified investments and engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

our insurance may not cover or mitigate all the risks facing our business 

while we have insurance coverage for most aspects of our business risk this insurance coverage may be incomplete or inadequate or in some cases may not be available our business has evolving risks that may be unpredictable for certain risks we face we may be required to or may elect to selfinsure or rely on insurance held by third parties legal defenses and immunities indemnification agreements or limits on liability which may be insufficient 

for example we may not have adequate insurance coverage related to the actions of sellers on our platforms in evolving areas such as platform products liability recent court decisions such as mcmillan v amazon in texas and loomis v amazon and bolger v amazon in california suggest that different jurisdictions may take differing positions on the scope of ecommerce platform liability for seller products in some circumstances a platform might be held liable for violations of applicable legal regimes by sellers and their products such as intellectual property laws privacy and security laws product regulation or consumer protection laws court decisions and regulatory changes in these areas may shift quickly both in the united states and worldwide and our insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to protect us from existing or newly developing legal risks 

finally while some sellers on our platforms may be insured for some or all of these risks many small businesses do not carry any or sufficient insurance and even if a seller is insured the insurance may not cover the relevant loss 

these factors may lead to increased costs for insurance our increased liability increased liability or requirements on sellers on our platforms changes to our marketplaces or business model or other damage to our brands and reputation 

strategic risks related to our business and industry 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

operating ecommerce marketplaces is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain sellers and buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for sellers with marketplaces retailers social media commerce and companies that sell software and services to small businesses for example in addition to listing her goods for sale on the etsy marketplace a seller can list her goods with online retailers such as amazon ebay google or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook instagram and tiktok she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplaces or otherwise we similarly compete for sellers on our other marketplaces depop reverb and elo7 which sellers may list their goods with online retailers such as vinted thredup or poshmark in the case of depop sweetwater in the case of reverb or mercadolibre in the case of elo7 among others or sell through other venues marketplaces retailers or commerce channels 

we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling a seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platforms or enabling her to sell through multiple channels such as bigcommerce wix and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain sellers based on many factors including 

• the value and awareness of our brands 

• the effectiveness of our product and marketing investments 

• the effectiveness of our scaled member support and trust and safety practices and policies 

• the global scale of our marketplaces and the breadth of our online presence 

• our tools education and services which support a seller in running her business 

• the number and engagement of buyers 

• our policies and fees 

• the ability of a seller to scale her business 

• the effectiveness of our mobile apps 

• the strength of our communities and 

• our mission 

in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of buyers a buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer including large ecommerce marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba national retail chains such as west elm walmart or target local consignment and vintage stores social commerce channels like instagram or facebook eventdriven platforms and vertical experiences like zola and wayfair resale commerce and streaming video commerce sites and apps and other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for our sellers to match as pandemicrelated restrictions and habits evolve competition may intensify as buyers return to traditional brick and mortar retail stores 

we compete to attract engage and retain buyers based on many factors including 

• the breadth and quality of items that sellers list in our marketplaces 

• the ease of finding items 

• the value and awareness of our brands 

• the effectiveness of our marketing 

• the persontoperson commerce experience 

• customer service 

• our reputation for trustworthiness 

• the effectiveness of our mobile apps 

• the availability of timely fair and free shipping offered by sellers to buyers 

• ease of payment 

• localization and experiences targeted based on regional preferences and 

• the availability and reliability of our platforms 

many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do large widely adopted platforms may benefit from significant user bases access to user or industrywide data the ability to unilaterally set policies and standards and control over complementary services such as fulfillment advertising or onplatform apps or ecommerce transactions to the extent etsy and our sellers may rely on these competitors’ services such services may be integrated into site functionality and these competitors may have access to substantial data about etsy and its communities of buyers and sellers as a result they may have the ability to reduce our ability to service our users reduce our ability to obtain analytics or information to optimize advertising or intentionally seek to disintermediate etsy 

we believe that it is and that it should continue to be relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship however as the technology space is increasingly subject to regulation there is a risk that legislation and regulatory or competition inquiries even if focused on large widely adopted platforms may inadvertently impede smaller platforms and small businesses including us and our sellers for example legislation and inquiries may result in obligations with which only large platforms are situated to comply if legislation or regulatory inquiries even if focused on other entities requires us to expend significant resources in response or results in the imposition of new obligations our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

depop’s growth and profitability depends on its ability to attract new buyers and sellers expand internationally and to compete effectively in new and existing markets 

depop provides an online platform for resale of used and vintage apparel and accessories to grow gms and profitability depop must grow its active seller and buyer communities in the united states and the united kingdom expand into new geographies and compete effectively in the increasingly competitive resale sector 

the markets for resale and secondhand items are highly competitive in addition depop competes with vendors of new and secondhand items including branded goods stores local national and global department stores traditional brickandmortar consignment and thrift stores specialty retailers directtoconsumer retailers discount chains independent retail stores the online offerings of traditional retail competitors and resale sellers specializing in niche or narrow categories as well as online marketplaces that may offer the same or similar goods and services that depop offers competitors offering secondhand apparel include other online marketplaces such as ebay vinted thredup poshmark and the realreal other competitors include large online and traditional retailers such as amazon hm kohl’s and walmart offprice retailers such as burlington stores ross stores and the tjx companies and lowcost fastfashion retailers such as shein we believe depop’s ability to compete depends on many factors many of which are beyond its control including 

• attracting and retaining active buyers and sellers and increasing the volume of secondhand items they buy and sell 

• sellers offering a broad selection of desirable and highquality secondhand items on depop’s marketplace 

• continuing appeal of secondhand fashion to gen z and other demographics 

• growing favorable brand recognition in new and existing markets 

• the speed and cost at which depop sellers ship purchased items to buyers and 

• the ease with which depop buyers and sellers can purchase supply and return secondhand items 

as resale markets continue to evolve and expand we anticipate competition in this sector to increase moreover consumer preferences may change or growth in consumer demand for used items may decelerate or even decrease and buyers may not purchase through depop’s marketplace as frequently or spend as much with depop sellers as they have historically relatedly an inability to attract and retain buyers could harm our ability to attract and retain sellers who may decide to resell their items through alternative platforms or marketplaces 

if we are not able to keep pace with technological changes and enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers our business financial performance and growth may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands and preferences and we are not able to predict the effect of these changes on our business the technologies that we currently use to support our platforms may become inadequate or obsolete and the cost of incorporating new technologies into our products and services may be substantial our sellers and buyers however may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs or create value for them additionally as we invest in and experiment with new offerings or changes to our platforms our sellers and buyers may find these changes to be disruptive and may perceive them negatively in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for public launch is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive gms or revenue growth may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy sellers and buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may not drive the gms or revenue that we anticipate may have lower margins than we anticipate or than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing and maintaining them which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

if the widely adopted mobile social search andor advertising solutions that we our sellers and our buyers rely on as part of our key offering are no longer available or effective or if access to these major platforms is limited the use of our marketplaces could decline 

we are dependent on widelyadopted third party platforms to reach our customers such as popular mobile social search and advertising offerings if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on these platforms or if our or our sellers’ access to these platforms is limited or if these large platforms implement features that compete with us or our sellers then our products and marketing efforts may suffer and our sellers’ ability to manage and scale their business may be harmed in addition we may not be able to deliver a rewarding experience we may have limited access to or we may be unable to invest significant time and resources towards integration with and offering our services through new or updated devices operating system versions social networks or search platforms including internet of things “iot” based or voice based platforms if our solutions and integrations are ineffective or unavailable such as when impacted or limited by a change imposed by a third party platform then our products and marketing efforts may suffer and our sellers’ ability to manage and scale their business may be harmed as a consequence our sellers may choose to sell elsewhere and our business may suffer 

conversion rates differ between web mobile web and mobile app traffic if visits to our platforms from sources with lower conversion rates such as mobile web for the etsycom marketplace were to increase as a percentage of overall visits it could adversely impact our conversion rate and reduce gms on our platforms which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

the success of our marketplaces could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as actions taken by providers of mobile and desktop operating systems social networks or search and advertising platforms including 

• policy changes that interfere with add tolls to or otherwise limit our ability to provide users with a full experience of our platforms such as for our mobile apps or social network presence 

• unfavorable treatment received by our platforms especially as compared to competing platforms such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store 

• increased costs to distribute or use our platforms via mobile apps social networks or established search and advertising systems 

• changes in mobile operating systems such as ios and android that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps our understanding of the usage or our services or that give preferential treatment to competitive products 

• changes to social networks that degrade the ecommerce functionality features or marketing of us or our sellers’ shops and products or 

• implementation and interpretation of regulatory or industry standards by these widely adopted platforms that as a side effect degrade the ecommerce functionality features or marketing of us or our sellers’ shops and products 

if sellers and buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our marketplaces through these widely adopted access providers our business financial performance and growth may be adversely affected 

expanding our operations outside of the united states is part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

we are focused on growing our business both inside and outside of the united states although we have a significant number of sellers and buyers outside of the united states we are a usbased company with less experience developing local markets internationally and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing operations and people over diverse geographic areas with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platforms and business operations to local markets 

our ability to grow our international operations may also be adversely affected by any circumstances that reduce or hinder crossborder trade for example the shipping of goods crossborder is typically more expensive and slower than domestic shipping and often involves complex customs and duty inspections and the dependency of national postal carrier systems if jurisdictions become increasingly fragmented with additional regulation of small sellers and platforms tariffs certifications representative requirements and customs requirements that increase the cost or complexity of crossborder trade whether on the seller’s sourcing of materials or between the seller and buyer our business could be adversely impacted in addition our international growth strategy may be adversely affected by the extent to which the covid19 pandemic outside the united states results in further quarantines closures delayed or terminated delivery services and movement restriction 

our success outside the united states also depends upon our ability to attract sellers and buyers from the same countries in order to enable the growth of local markets an inability to develop our communities globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets along with regulations that may favor local companies some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

despite our execution efforts the goods that sellers list on our etsy and reverb marketplaces may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy and reverb brands as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to our etsy and reverb marketplaces from buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of a strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that most of the goods listed on these platforms are denominated in us dollars similarly nonuk consumers may be less familiar with depop or find the listed items less appealing than consumers in the united kingdom and nonbrazilian consumers may be less familiar with elo7 or find the listed items less appealing than consumers in brazil 

continued international expansion may also require significant financial investment for example etsy has made investments to address growth opportunities in india a dynamic market where we have limited operating experience and acquired elo7 which extends etsy’s reach in latin america to facilitate continued international expansion we plan to continue investing in seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring additional companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect or unsuccessful 

our recent acquisitions of depop and elo7 may create strains on our management technology and operational resources and may prove to be costlier and take longer to integrate than we anticipate which may ultimately reduce or eliminate the benefits to etsy of the acquisitions 

we expect that our acquisitions of depop and elo7 will continue to require significant attention and resources from our management team and workforce including our technology operations accounting and human resource units devoting resources to the integration of depop and elo7 means that these resources will be redeployed to varying degrees from their normal daytoday activities supporting existing etsy functions this could impair our effectiveness and efficiency in serving existing etsy sellers and buyers and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for example 

to the extent our products and marketing teams are involved in supporting depop and elo7 they may be unable to devote sufficient time to product and marketing efforts relating to the etsy and reverb marketplaces which may materially impact our business growth or results of operations 

we incurred substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with our acquisitions of depop and elo7 and may experience difficulty in realizing the expected benefits of the acquisitions 

we incurred significant nonrecurring expenses in connection with our acquisition of depop and to a lesser extent our acquisition of elo7 including legal accounting filing financial advisory and integration planning and other expenses additionally while we intend to operate depop and elo7 as standalone marketplaces we may continue to incur significant expenses as we invest to grow their respective businesses and implement public company compliance policies and procedures including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as well as information privacy controls 

also the success of the depop and elo7 acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to apply etsy’s technological marketing and operational expertise to help scale their growth in a profitable efficient and effective manner including maintaining relationships with their respective sellers buyers and third party service providers because our business and the depop and elo7 businesses differ in certain respects we may not be able to manage these businesses smoothly or successfully and may experience difficulty in realizing the expected benefits of the acquisitions 

potential difficulties that may be encountered include the following 

• the loss of key employees 

• challenges in executing on depop’s and elo7’s business plans and 

• potential unknown liabilities unforeseen expenses and other complexities associated with integrating depop and elo7 into and managing our “house of brands” 

in addition we recorded approximately 11 billion and 1572 million of goodwill from our acquisitions of depop and elo7 respectively we review goodwill for impairment at least annually impairment may result from among other things deterioration in performance adverse market conditions including adverse market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations challenges applying etsy’s technological marketing and operational expertise to help scale the depop and elo7 marketplaces in a profitable efficient and effective manner and a variety of other factors the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully integrate depop and elo7 into our “house of brands” strategy we may be unable to realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of these acquisitions as a result our business growth andor results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may have limited redress with respect to claims under the depop and elo7 acquisition agreements 

the agreements pursuant to which we acquired depop and elo7 contain representations warranties and covenants that are customary for transactions of their nature as well as limitations on the obligations and liabilities of the former equityholders of depop and elo7 as applicable including in the case of the depop acquisition no recourse directly against depop’s former shareholders for a breach of the businessrelated representations and warranties in connection with the depop acquisition we have obtained customary representation and warranty insurance to insure against losses that may arise from breaches of certain representation and warranties included in the depop acquisition agreement which policy is itself subject to specified limitations and exclusions under the elo7 agreement an indemnity escrow was established our ability to make claims and recover against the escrow and the sellers may be contractually timebarred under the elo7 merger agreement depending on the nature of the claim our ability to make claims will expire between 18 month and six years from the date of the acquisition there can be no assurance that in the event of a claim made in connection with the depop acquisition the policy would cover the relevant losses nor can there be any assurance that the proceeds that are recoverable under the policy if any in the case of the depop acquisition or the proceeds that are recoverable from the indemnity escrow if available in the case of the elo7 acquisition would be sufficient to compensate us for any losses incurred therefore we may have no or limited recourse with respect to claims for breach of the representations warranties covenants or other provisions contained in the depop and elo7 acquisition agreements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the due diligence undertaken by us in connection with the depop and elo7 acquisitions may not have revealed all relevant considerations or liabilities of depop andor elo7 which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

although we conducted due diligence in connection with our acquisitions of depop and elo7 we cannot assure you that this due diligence revealed all relevant facts necessary to fully evaluate depop and elo7 furthermore the information provided during due diligence may have been incomplete inadequate or inaccurate as part of each due diligence process and our evaluation of the relevant opportunity we also made subjective judgments regarding the results of operations financial condition and prospects of depop and elo7 if the due diligence investigation failed to correctly or completely identify material issues and liabilities that may be present in depop or elo7 or if we considered certain risks to be commercially acceptable relative to the respective opportunity we may incur substantial unexpected or greater than anticipated expense should such issues liabilities or risks materialize in addition we may be subject to significant previously undisclosed liabilities of depop and elo7 that were not identified during due diligence and that could contribute to poor financial or operational performance and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may expand our business through additional acquisitions of other businesses or assets or strategic partnerships and investments which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of businesses in the past including our recent acquisitions of depop and elo7 in july 2021 and may acquire additional businesses or technologies or enter into strategic partnerships in the future we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or any partnerships and possible future acquisitions or relationships may disrupt our business and divert management’s time and attention acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky any future acquisitions or partnerships may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 

• integrating new businesses and technologies into our infrastructure 

• clearing any required regulatory review that may be complex costly time consuming or place additional requirements on the business 

• implementing growth initiatives 

• integrating administrative functions 

• hiring retaining and integrating key employees 

• supporting and enhancing morale and culture 

• retaining key customers merchants vendors and other key business partners 

• maintaining or developing controls procedures and policies including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as well as information privacy controls and 

• assuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before and after the acquisition including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations intellectual property infringement commercial disputes cyber attacks taxes and other matters 

we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition or partnership which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions or partnerships could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our communities 

our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplaces and services is important to our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers one of the key parts of our strategy for the etsy marketplace is to bring more new buyers to the marketplace and create more habitual buyers by inspiring more frequent purchases across multiple categories and purchase occasions we continue to iterate on and invest in our marketing strategies for each of our marketplaces which may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans 

our performance marketing efforts currently include search engine optimization search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as social media mobile push notifications and email marketing if we fail to scale and deliver an effective return on investment in any of these marketing efforts it may harm our business we also engage with celebrities and influencers as part of our marketing efforts and our perceived affiliation with these individuals could cause us brand or reputational damage in the event they undertake actions inconsistent with our brands and values 

additionally we invest significantly in brand advertising via channels such as television and digital video advertising if we do not produce effective content or purchase effective air time and placement for that content it could fail to deliver a return on our investment and damage our brands andor business many of our marketing efforts include our sellers and products from their shops selected via automated systems these automated systems may not always operate effectively while both our manual and automated systems have tools and procedures designed to account for our and our partners’ policies despite our best efforts we may inadvertently include in our marketing efforts sellers or their products inconsistent with our policies brands and values which could result in failure to deliver a return on our investment media or regulatory scrutiny and damage to our brands andor business 

we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search alter analytics or search engine optimization data available to us or make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplaces and reduce the number of visits or otherwise negatively impact our marketing efforts 

we also obtain a significant number of visits from social media platforms such as facebook instagram and pinterest search engines social networks and other third parties typically require compliance with their policies and procedures which may be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities including marketing services for our sellers gms and revenue etsyprovided controls for users to limit third party advertising features the growing use of online adblocking software and technological changes to browsers and mobile operating systems impact the effectiveness of or our visibility and insights into our marketing efforts as a result we may fail to bring more buyers or fail to increase frequency of visits to our platforms in addition ongoing legal and regulatory changes in the data privacy sphere such as the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” the california privacy rights act of 2020 “cpra” and additional laws being passed or considered in us states and countries throughout the world may impact the scope and effectiveness of marketing and advertising services generally including those used on our platforms 

we also obtain a significant number of visits through email marketing if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our sellers and buyers if our email subscription tools do not function correctly or if our sellers and buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected as ecommerce search and social networking as well as related regulatory regimes evolve we must continue to evolve our marketing tactics and technology accordingly and if we are unable to do so our business could be adversely affected 

some providers of consumer devices mobile or desktop operating systems and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective similarly our vendors particularly those providing advertising and analytics products and services have and may continue to modify their products and services based on legal and technical changes relating to privacy in ways that could reduce the efficiency of our marketing efforts and our access to data about use of our platforms any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

enforcement of our marketplace policies may negatively impact our brands reputation andor our financial performance 

we maintain and enforce policies that outline expectations for users while they engage with our services whether as a seller a buyer or a third party and are implementing and enforcing similar policies at depop and elo7 as we integrate them into our marketplace policy program additionally we prohibit a range of items on our marketplaces including but not limited to drugs alcohol tobacco weapons endangered animal products hazardous materials recalled items or those that create an unreasonable risk of harm highlyregulated items items violating intellectual property rights of others illegal products pornography items from federallysanctioned jurisdictions hateful content and items that promote or glorify violence 

we enforce these policies in order to uphold the safety and integrity of our marketplaces engender trust in the use of our services and encourage positive connections among members of our communities we strive to enforce these policies in a consistent and principled manner that is transparent and explicable to stakeholders however even with a principled and objective approach policy enforcement is a combination of human and technological review as a result there could be errors it could be subject to different inconsistent or conflicting regional consensus or regulatory standards in different jurisdictions or it could be perceived to be arbitrary unclear or inconsistent similarly the tools and processes in place with respect to etsy’s recently acquired marketplaces elo7 and depop are not as sophisticated or mature as those used by etsy shortcomings and errors in our ability to enforce our policies across our marketplaces could lead to negative public perception distrust from our members or lack of confidence in the use of our services and could negatively impact the reputation of our brands in particular certain enforcement decisions even those we deem necessary for the health and safety of our marketplaces may be received negatively by stakeholders or the public such as 

• we may choose to limit or prohibit the sale of items in our marketplaces based on our policies even though we could benefit financially from the sale of those items 

• from time to time we may revise our policies in ways that we believe will enhance trust in our platforms even though the changes may be perceived unfavorably such as updates to the way we define handmade 

we are subject to risks related to our environmental social and governance activities and disclosures 

we have developed an impact strategy that focuses on growing sustainably by aligning our mission and business strategy to help create economic impact through entrepreneurship we have also announced a number of goals and initiatives and elected to publicly report on a significant number of environmental and social metrics that we monitor our “esg metrics” and include them in this annual report as a result our business may face heightened scrutiny for these activities see part i item 1 “business—esg reporting our impact goals strategy  progress” while selected metrics receive limited assurance from an independent third party this is inherently a less rigorous process than reasonable assurance sought in connection with a financial statement audit and such review process may not identify errors and may not protect us from potential liability under the securities laws in addition for some of the metrics we report the methodology of computation andor the scope of our value chain assessed continues to evolve from year to year as a result period over period comparisons may not be meaningful 

the implementation of our goals and initiatives may require considerable investments and our goals with all of their contingencies dependencies and in certain cases reliance on thirdparty verification andor performance are complex and ambitious and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them if we do not demonstrate progress against our impact strategy or if our impact strategy is not perceived to be adequate our reputation could be harmed we could also damage our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report and demonstrate that our commitment to our impact strategy enhances our overall financial performance 

additionally there can be no assurance that our current programs reporting frameworks and principles will be in compliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may be promulgated in the united states and elsewhere and the costs of changing any of our current practices to comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and elsewhere may be substantial furthermore industry and market practices may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any new laws and regulations and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay competitive among our peers 

any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could impact employee engagement and retention the willingness of our buyers and sellers and our partners and vendors to do business with us or investors’ willingness to purchase or hold shares of our common stock any of which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

if we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy or if our strategy proves to be ineffective our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

our ability to execute our strategy including our ”house of brands” strategy is dependent on a number of factors including the ability of our senior management team and key team leaders to execute the strategy our ability to iterate in a rapidly evolving ecommerce landscape maintain our pace of product experiments coupled with the success of such initiatives our ability to meet the changing needs of our sellers and buyers and the ability of our employees to perform at a high level if we are unable to execute our strategy if our strategy does not drive the growth that we anticipate if the public perception is that we are not executing on our strategy or if our market opportunity is not as large as we have estimated it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders any debt financing that we may secure in the future could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures repurchasing our stock or declaring dividends it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all weakness and volatility in capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt in the future we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt when due 

our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness including the 0 convertible senior notes due 2023 we issued in march 2018 the “2018 notes” the 0125 convertible senior notes due 2026 we issued in september 2019 the “2019 notes” the 0125 convertible senior notes due 2027 we issued in august 2020 the “2020 notes” and the 025 

convertible senior notes due 2028 we issued in june 2021 the “2021 notes” and together with the 2018 notes the 2019 notes and the 2020 notes the “notes” depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive in addition any required repurchase of the notes for cash as a result of a fundamental change would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business or could require us to obtain additional financing to fund the repurchase our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations based on the daily closing prices of our stock during the quarter ended december 31 2021 holders of the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are eligible to convert their 2018 notes and 2019 notes as applicable during the first quarter of 2021 see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—debt” for more information on the 2018 notes and 2019 notes 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt if for example we incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt these actions may diminish our ability to make payments on our substantial debt when due 

regulatory compliance and legal risks 

failure to deal effectively with constantly evolving fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business 

our operations are subject to anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” which generally prohibit us and our officers employees and third party intermediaries from directly or indirectly offering authorizing or making improper payments to government officials and other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or another advantage our operations are also subject to us and foreign export controls trade sanctions and import laws and regulations such laws may restrict or prohibit the provision of certain products andor services to countries governments and persons targeted by us sanctions we have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to ensure compliance with law including for example anticorruption antimoney laundering export control and trade sanctions requirements and we have measures in place to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity in our marketplaces however those policies procedures and measures may not always be effective further the measures that we use to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity must be dynamic and require significant investment and resources particularly as our marketplaces increase in public visibility and size bad actors constantly apply continually evolving technologies and ways to commit fraud and other illegal activity and regulations requiring marketplaces to detect and limit these activities are increasing our measures may not always keep up with these changes if we fail to limit the impact of illegal activity in our marketplaces we could be subject to penalties fines other enforcement actions andor significant expenses and our business reputation financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform certain compliance services if we or our service providers do not perform adequately our compliance tools may not be effective which could increase our expenses lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business in addition we could be subject to penalties fines other sanctions andor significant expenses 

our brands may be harmed if third parties or members of our communities use or attempt to use our marketplaces as part of their illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our mission and guiding principles makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by our sellers or other members of our communities our seller policies promote legal and ethical business practices etsy expects sellers to work only with manufacturers who comply with all applicable laws who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions we also expect our suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct we expect that once we fully integrate depop and elo7 into our supply chain management program depop and elo7 suppliers will also be subject to the supplier code of conduct although we seek to influence we do not directly control our sellers suppliers or other members of our communities or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our communities engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

we may be subject to claims that items listed by sellers in our marketplaces are counterfeit infringing illegal harmful or otherwise violate our policies 

we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplaces or other usergenerated materials posted on our platforms infringe upon thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplaces along with both proactive and reactive anticounterfeiting measures that we use and continue to develop we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine 

the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplaces and in certain cases closing the shops of sellers who violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability for example on the etsy marketplace we use a combination of automatic and manual tools and depend upon human review in many circumstances no tools and procedures are guaranteed to function completely without error particularly for physical nonstandardized goods our tools and procedures may be subject to error or enforcement failures and may not be adequately staffed and we may be subject to an increasing number of erroneous or fraudulent demands to remove content in addition we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by sellers on our platforms especially outside the united states where laws may offer less protection for intermediaries and platforms than in the united states 

under current us copyright laws such as the digital millennium copyright act § 512 et seq we benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on our platforms by sellers and buyers and we rely upon user content platform protections under 47 usc § 230 commonly referred to as cda § 230 that limits most nonintellectual property law claims against etsy based upon content posted by users on our platforms however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and limits on platform liability for these forms of intellectual property are primarily based upon court decisions similarly laws related to product liability vary by jurisdiction and the liability of marketplace platforms for products and services of sellers while traditionally limited is subject to increasing debate in courts legislatures and legislative proposals and with regulators these safe harbors and court rulings including analogous ones in other state and international jurisdictions have and may change unfavorably moreover changes focused on actions by very large platforms that perform retailerlike functions or handle mass user content may directly or indirectly also impact us our sellers buyers and vendors 

proposed and enacted laws in europe and the united states may change the scope of platform liability and ongoing case law developments may unpredictably increase our liability as platforms for user activity in that event we may be held directly or secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement product compliance deficiencies consumer protection deficiencies privacy and data protection incidents or regulatory issues of our sellers including potentially for their conduct over which we have no control or influence 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit harmful or unlawful goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by sellers on our platforms we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties as in the past claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could seek substantial damages or force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platforms less userfriendly these claims or legal and regulatory changes could require the removal of noninfringing lawful or completely unrelated content which could negatively impact our business and our ability to retain sellers moreover public perception that unlicensed counterfeit harmful or unlawful items are commonly offered by sellers in our marketplaces even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

we have been involved in and in the future may be involved in litigation and regulatory matters that are expensive and time consuming and that may require changes to our strategy the features of our platforms andor how our business operates 

in addition to intellectual property claims we have been involved in other litigation and regulatory matters including matters related to consumer protection product liability security and privacy commercial or stockholder derivative lawsuits either individually or where available on a classaction basis we have been and may in the future be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny inquiries or investigations including with respect to our sellers vendors or third parties relating to both specific inquiries as well as broad industrywide concerns such as antitrust product liability and privacy that could lead to increased expenses or reputational damage for example while we have stated on our etsy marketplace platform that items offered by sellers on etsy such as masks and hand sanitizers are not medicalgrade and that our sellers cannot make substantive medical or health claims we may nevertheless be subject to claims based in whole or in part on the actions of sellers in violation of that directive 

under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters any lawsuit or regulatory action to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we have in the past settled lawsuits and regulatory actions and may decide in the future to settle lawsuits or regulatory actions even if nonmeritorious any such settlements may be on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we limit certain claims against us under our house rules or terms of use including through requirements for arbitration limits on class actions limitations of liability venue selection and indemnification requirements these requirements may be subject to differing interpretations and legal frameworks in different us federal state and foreign jurisdiction courts and may have 

reduced or no enforceability in some jurisdictions where these claim limitations are unavailable to us it could significantly increase our costs require significant resources across multiple jurisdictions result in complex or inconsistent decisions and subject us to forum shopping by third parties seeking jurisdictions amenable to their claims 

lawsuits or other enforcement actions brought against us have resulted in settlements and may result in injunctions damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business although we establish accruals for our litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable there may be a material exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued or in excess of any loss contingencies disclosed as reasonably possible particularly in more uncertain legal or regulatory environments such loss contingencies may not be probable and reasonably estimable until the proceedings have progressed significantly which could take several years and occur close to resolution of the matter 

expanding and evolving regulations in the areas of privacy and user data protection could create technological economic and complex crossborder business impediments to our business and those of our sellers 

we collect receive store process generate use transfer disclose make accessible protect secure dispose of and share personal information confidential information and other sensitive or potentially protected information necessary to provide our service to operate our business for legal and marketing purposes and for other businessrelated purposes 

data protection has become a significant issue in the united states countries in the european union and in many other countries in which we operate in addition to the actual and potential changes in law described elsewhere in these risk factors global developments in privacy and data security regulations are changing some of the ways we our sellers our vendors and other third parties collect use and share personal information and other proprietary or confidential information compliance with these changing regulations has necessitated some specific product changes for our nonus activities and required additional compliance obligations for us and for our relationships with sellers vendors and other third parties 

in the european union the gdpr contains strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals residing in the european economic area “eea” switzerland and in a form frozen as of december 31 2020 and as further separately domestically amended the united kingdom the gdpr seeks to harmonize the data protection regulations throughout these jurisdictions the regulation contains numerous requirements and changes from previous eu law including more robust obligations on data controllers and data processors greater rights for data subjects requiring potentially significant changes to both our technology and operations security and accountability obligations and significantly heavier documentation and recordkeeping requirements for data protection compliance programs specifically the gdpr introduced numerous privacyrelated changes for companies operating in the eea including greater control over personal data by data subjects eg the “right to be forgotten” increased data portability access and redress rights for eu data subjects data breach notification requirements increased rules for online and email marketing compliance requirements related to our sellers vendors and third parties and stronger regulatory enforcement regimes the gdpr is subject to changing interpretations due to decisions of data protection authorities courts and related legislative efforts both euwide and in particular jurisdictions the gdpr requirements apply to some thirdparty transactions such as commercial contracts with partners and vendors and to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including user and employee information gdpr requirements may also apply depending on interpretation of its reach to some users in our worldwide communities of sellers we may experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new eu sellers or current and new sellers may limit their selling into the european union due to the legal requirements compliance cost potential risk exposure and uncertainty for them in respect of their own compliance obligations with respect to gdpr in addition although our sellers are independent businesses it is possible that a privacy authority could deem us jointly and severally liable for actions of our sellers or vendors which would increase our potential liability exposure and costs of compliance which could negatively impact our business we could face potential liability regulatory investigation and costly litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance 

in the united states rules and regulations governing data privacy and security include those promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission act the electronic communications privacy act the computer fraud and abuse act california’s ccpa which became effective january 1 2020 and cpra effective january 1 2023 and other state and federal laws relating to privacy consumer protection and data security the ccpa and cpra introduce new requirements regarding the handling of personal information of california consumers and households including compliance and record keeping obligations the right to request access to and deletion of their personal information and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches 

other jurisdictions in the united states are beginning to expand existing regulations or propose laws similar to the ccpa which will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally for example on march 2 2021 virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act “cdpa” which becomes effective on january 1 2023 and on june 8 2021 colorado enacted the colorado privacy act “cpa” which takes effect on july 1 2023 the cpa and cdpa are similar to the ccpa and cpra but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply if more stringent privacy legislation arises in the united states it could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally other countries outside of europe have enacted or are considering enacting 

similar crossborder data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency and strict limitations to the processing of personal information which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business in the past year for example brazil enacted the general data protection law new zealand enacted the new zealand privacy act china released its draft personal information protection law and canada introduced the digital charter implementation act 

gdpr ccpa and similar laws coming into effect in other jurisdictions may continue to change the data protection landscape globally may be potentially inconsistent or incompatible and could result in potentially significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business some of these requirements introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platforms and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact our business and future outlook complying with the gdpr ccpa cpra cdpa cpa or other laws regulations amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations and contractual or other obligations relating to privacy data protection data transfers data localization or information security may require us to make changes to our services to enable us or our customers to meet new legal requirements incur substantial operational costs modify our data practices and policies and restrict our business operations any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws regulations or other obligations may lead to significant fines penalties regulatory investigations lawsuits significant costs for remediation damage to our reputation or other liabilities beyond gdpr and ccpacpra individual jurisdictions continue to pass laws related to data protection such as data privacy and data breach notification resulting in a diverse set of requirements across states countries and regions noncompliance with these laws could result in proceedings against us by one or more data protection authorities other public authorities third parties or individuals under gdpr alone noncompliance could result in fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company whichever is greater we may not be entirely successful in our compliance efforts due to various factors either within our control such as limited internal resource allocation or outside our control such as a lack of vendor cooperation new regulatory interpretations or lack of regulatory guidance in respect of certain gdpr requirements 

in addition eu data protection laws including the gdpr also generally prohibit the transfer of personal information from europe to the united states and most other countries unless the recipient country has been deemed to have adequate privacy protections in place to protect the personal information parties transferring protected personal data to jurisdictions deemed inadequate must establish a legal basis for and implement specific safeguards for such intraparty or interparty transfers a recent judgment in 2020 of the court of justice of the european union found a common basis for such transfers the euus privacy shield insufficient and a parallel arrangement with switzerland was similarly deemed insufficient in september 2020 while etsy did not rely upon privacy shield for crossborder transfers reverb previously had done so while effective solutions may be available to permit these transfers such as standard contractual clauses “sccs” continuing changes to the rules related to crossborder transfers may nonetheless impede etsy and its subsidiaries’ ability to effectively transfer data between jurisdictions with parties such as partners vendors and users or may make such transfers of personal data more costly in particular another recent decision and related european commission guidance and updates to the sccs may impose additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the sccs and may require significant expense and resources associated with compliance in particular on june 4 2021 the european commission adopted new sccs under the gdpr for personal data transfers outside the eea which may require us to expend significant resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with such obligations transfers by us or our vendors of personal information from europe pursuant to sccs may not comply with eu data protection law may increase our exposure to the gdpr’s heightened sanctions for violations of its crossborder data transfer restrictions and may result in lower sales on our platforms because of difficulty of establishing a lawful basis for personal information transfers out of europe 

we also publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection processing use and disclosure of personal data although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so moreover despite our efforts we may not be successful in achieving compliance such as if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies and documentation we are subject to occasional requests from regulators regarding these efforts failures can subject us to potential international local state and federal action under both data protection and consumer protection laws we are or may also be subject to the terms of our own and third party external and internal privacy and security policies codes representations certifications industry standards publications and frameworks and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy information security including contractual obligations to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with data protection laws or other obligations 

our sellers and vendors may have been and may in the future be subject to similar privacy requirements which may significantly increase costs and resources dedicated to their compliance with such requirements we have varying contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches related to us or in some cases our thirdparty service providers many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals regulatory authorities and others of security breaches involving certain types of data in some circumstances in addition our agreements with certain stakeholders may require us to notify them in the event of such a security breach such mandatory disclosures even if only related to actions of a thirdparty vendor are costly could lead to negative publicity may cause members of our communities to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to andor alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach and may cause us to breach customer contracts our contracts our representations or industry standards to varying extents require us to use industrystandard or reasonable measures to safeguard sensitive personal information or confidential information a cyber incident or security breach could lead to claims by members of our communities or other relevant stakeholders that we have failed to comply with such legal or 

contractual obligations as a result we could be subject to legal action or members of our communities could end their relationships with us there can be no assurance that any indemnifications limitations of liability or other remedies in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches including fines judgments settlements penalties costs attorney fees and other impacts that arise out of incidents or breaches if the impacts of a security incident or breach or the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage is of a type not subject to insurance or results in changes to our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements it could have an adverse effect on our business in addition we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage cyber coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to all or part of any future claim or loss our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand grow our customer base and process store and transmit increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data 

expanding our operations in latin america and india may expose us to additional risks 

we recently acquired elo7 which currently operates principally in brazil and we additionally recently opened offices in mexico and india each of these jurisdictions has a legal framework regulatory environment and culture that differs materially from those of north america and europe where our operations have historically been located in addition the timing and impact of the covid19 pandemic has been materially different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction if we are unable to manage these risks it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth further the success of our elo7 marketplace may be adversely affected by macroeconomic social and political conditions prevailing in brazil and latin america decreases in the growth rate periods of negative growth increases in inflation persistent deflation changes in law regulation policy or future judicial rulings and interpretations of policies involving exchange and capital controls and other matters such as but not limited to currency depreciation foreign exchange regulations inflation interest rates taxation employment and labor laws banking laws anticorruption laws and regulations and other political economic or regulatory developments in or affecting brazil andor other parts of latin america may affect the overall business environment and may in turn adversely impact elo7’s financial condition and results of operations in the future or create obstacles to the successful integration of elo7 into etsy 

our business and our sellers and buyers may be subject to evolving sales and other tax regimes in various jurisdictions which may harm our business 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial tax goods and services tax business tax withholding tax digital service tax gross receipt tax and tax information reporting obligations to businesses like ours and to our sellers and buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear when and how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to our sellers’ businesses in some cases it may be difficult or impossible for us to validate information provided to us by our sellers on which we must rely to ascertain any obligations that may apply to us related to our sellers’ businesses given the intricate nature of these regulations as they apply to particular products or services and that many of the products and services sold in our marketplace are unique or handmade if we are found to be deficient in how we have addressed our tax obligations our business could be adversely impacted 

various jurisdictions including the us states and eu member states are seeking to or have recently imposed additional reporting recordkeeping indirect tax collection and remittance obligations or revenuebased taxes on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce for example the recently enacted american rescue plan act of 2021 included a provision which significantly increases the number of sellers for whom we must report payment transactions if requirements like these become applicable in additional jurisdictions our business collectively with our sellers’ businesses could be harmed for example taxing authorities in many us states and in other countries have targeted ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and have enacted laws and others are considering similar legislation such changes to current law or new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on our marketplaces causes our marketplaces to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers which could materially impact our business and our sellers’ businesses this legislation could also require us or our sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling on our marketplaces less attractive additionally the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to provide information about our buyers sellers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various authorities in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build solutions and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the applicable effective date 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws accessibility requirements and taxation and laws and regulations focused on ecommerce and online marketplaces such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability marketplace seller regulation intellectual property product liability and consumer protection in addition new regulations laws policies and international accords relating to environmental and social matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in europe the united states and elsewhere which may entail specific targetdriven frameworks andor disclosure requirements in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws in some cases nonus privacy data security consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more detailed or comprehensive than those in the united states and in some countries are actively enforced 

these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort in some jurisdictions these laws and regulations subject us to attempts to apply domestic rules worldwide against etsy or its subsidiaries and occasionally may subject us to inconsistent obligations across jurisdictions 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to online marketplaces as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by online marketplaces or ecommerce for example as described elsewhere in these risk factors laws relating to privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements that are applicable to etsy and its marketplaces 

new platform liability laws potential amendments to existing laws and ongoing regulatory and judicial interpretation of these laws imparting liability for conduct by users of a platform may create costs and uncertainty for both etsy and sellers on our platforms this may even be the case for new laws or regulations focused on other technology areas business practices or other third parties that nonetheless indirectly or unintentionally impact us our sellers or our vendors for example the european union’s pending digital services act “dsa” digital markets act “dma” and proposed changes to the general product safety directive “gpsd” may impact us directly as well as impacting our sellers and vendors similarly recently adopted antiwaste regulations in germany and france may directly impact our sellers as well as impose compliance verification obligations on us if we and our sellers are unable to costeffectively comply with new regulatory regimes such as if the regulations place requirements on our sellers that they find difficult or impossible to comply with or require us to take actions at a scale inconsistent with the size investment and operation of our marketplaces our sellers may elect not to ship into or we may be required to restrict shipping into the impacted jurisdictions and our business could be harmed in addition there have been various congressional efforts to require platforms to vet and police sellers restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms for third party user content under intellectual property laws such as the digital millennium copyright act § 512 et seq or limit user content platform protections under 47 usc § 230 commonly referred to as cda § 230 as a result our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could significantly decrease or change we could incur significant costs implementing required changes investigating and defending claims and if we are found liable significant damages 

we also operate under an increasing number of regulatory regimes protecting us and our sellers and buyers worldwide such as intellectual property and anticounterfeiting laws payments and taxation competition marketplace platform regulation hate speech laws and general commerce regulation for example upcoming regulations may impose significant verification certification or additional compliance hurdles on both us and our sellers these laws and court or regulatory interpretations of these laws may shift quickly in the united states and worldwide we may not have the resources or scale to effectively adapt to and comply with any changes to these regulatory regimes which may limit our ability to take advantage of the protections these regimes offer in addition some of these changes may be at least partially inconsistent with how our platforms operate especially if they are adopted in the context of or in a manner best suited for larger platforms which may make it harder for us to utilize these regimes to protect our marketplaces if we are unable to costeffectively protect our platforms sellers and buyers under these regulatory regimes such as if the regulations place requirements on our sellers that they find difficult or impossible to comply with limit the functions or features our marketplaces can offer or require us to take actions at a scale inconsistent with the size investment and operation of our marketplaces our business could be harmed 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments or the inconsistent enforcement of such laws and regulations could impede the growth of ecommerce or online marketplaces which could have a negative impact on our business and operations examples include data localization requirements limitation on marketplace scope or ownership intellectual property intermediary liability rules regulation of online speech limits on network neutrality packaging and recycling requirements seller certification and representative requirements and rules related to security privacy or national security which may impede us our users or our vendors we could also face regulatory challenges or be subject to allegations of discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business we may be subject to regulatory requests for information or testimony related to regulatory challenges of third parties such as our competitors or our vendors which could cause us to incur significant costs and expend significant resources in response and could impact our relationship with those third parties 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not fully comply in the future particularly where the applicable regulatory regimes have not been broadly interpreted if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business our ability to rely on insurance or indemnification and other contractual remedies to limit these liabilities may be insufficient or unavailable in some cases furthermore the circumstances in which we may be held liable for the acts omissions or responsibilities of our sellers is uncertain complex and evolving for example certain laws have recently been enacted seeking to hold marketplaces like ours responsible for certain compliance obligations for which sellers have traditionally been responsible if an increasing number of such laws are passed the resulting compliance costs and potential liability risk could negatively impact our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which even if untrue could be extremely costly to defend damage our brands require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition and scale worldwide we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims third parties may have intellectual property rights that they claim cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings third parties sometimes allege a company is secondarily liable for intellectual property infringement or that it is a joint infringer with another party including claims that etsy is liable either directly indirectly or vicariously for infringement claims against sellers using etsy’s platforms our vendors or other third parties and that statutory judicial or other immunities and defenses do not protect us any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit have been and could in the future be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters for claims against us insurance may be insufficient or unavailable and for claims related to actions of third parties either indemnification or remedies against those parties may be insufficient or unavailable 

some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors patent holding companies and other intellectual property rights holders have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their perceived intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought directly against us or implicating us as part of an action against third parties such as our sellers or vendors could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where we do business we have been and might in the future be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platforms incorporate and we contribute to open source software potentially impairing our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property 

the software powering our platforms incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by us and the internet and technology industries have been interpreted by only a few court decisions and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplaces under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses 

to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software also presents additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platforms and availability of patches or fixes may not be consistent or quickly available as it may be subject to the continued community engagement in a particular open source project additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such 

software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code similarly we may be subject to third party intellectual property claims as a user of or contributor to such open source software any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we have difficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at the businesses we recently acquired or that we may in the future acquire or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and time consuming remedial measures further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud and individuals including employees and contractors could circumvent such controls because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

other risks 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities litigation we have experienced securities class action lawsuits in the past and may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

for example between january 1 2021 and february 18 2022 our common stock’s daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 12696 to a high of 29691 the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 

• variations in our operating results and other financial and operational metrics including the key financial and operating metrics disclosed in this annual report as well as how those results and metrics compare to analyst and investor expectations 

• forwardlooking statements related to our financial guidance or projections our failure to meet or exceed our financial guidance or projections or changes in our financial guidance or projections 

• failure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock or a negative view of our financial guidance or projections and our failure to meet or exceed the estimates of such analysts 

• entry into or exit from stock market indices 

• announcements of new services or enhancements strategic alliances or significant agreements or other developments by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of mergers or acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors 

• the amount and timing of our operating expenses and the success of any costsavings actions we take 

• changes in our board of directors or senior management team 

• disruptions in our marketplaces due to hardware software or network problems security breaches or other issues 

• the strength of the global economy or the economy in the jurisdictions in which we operate particularly during the current covid19 pandemic currency fluctuations and market conditions in our industry and those affecting members of our communities 

• the trading activity of our largest stockholders 

• the number of shares of our common stock that are available for public trading 

• litigation or other claims against us 

• stockholder activism 

• the operating performance of other similar companies 

• changes in legal requirements relating to our business and 

• any other factors discussed in this annual report 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial performance or growth stock prices of many internet and technology companies have historically been highly volatile 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock including upon conversion of our convertible notes could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future including as a result of conversion of the outstanding notes we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of the notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes each series of notes is convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled maturity in the event the conditional conversion features of such series of notes are triggered based on the daily closing prices of our stock during the quarter ended december 31 2021 holders of the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are eligible to convert their 2018 notes and 2019 notes as applicable during the first quarter of 2021 if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely cash to converting holders of such notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock increasing the number of outstanding shares of our common stock the issuance of such shares of common stock and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—debt” for more information on the notes 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law 

• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 

• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty 

• any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law and 

• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine 

this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act furthermore section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such securities act actions accordingly both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims while the delaware courts have determined that choice of forum provisions are facially valid a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than that designated 

in our exclusive forum provision in such instance we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provision of our certificate of incorporation this may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions 

this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

the actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business specifically responding to common actions of an activist stockholder such as requests for special meetings potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming or divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company which may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our ability to continue to commit to our mission guiding principles and culture may also be questioned which could impact our ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

our stock repurchases are discretionary and even if effected they may not achieve the desired objectives 

our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 250 million of our common stock of which approximately 127 million remained available as of december 31 2021 in addition in connection with issuance of the 2021 notes our board of directors approved the repurchase of 1800 million of our common stock and we used approximately 1800 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately 11 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to 17021 the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on june 8 2021 there can be no assurance that either the june 2021 stock repurchases or any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares in addition there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases in the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of recent and future employee stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting or of any issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of notes the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock if our financial condition deteriorates or we decide to use our cash for other purposes we may suspend repurchase activity at any time 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

• provide for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time 

• permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships 

• provide that directors may only be removed for cause 

• require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan 

• eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

• provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws and 

• require advance notice for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings 

these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company by imposing certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company

in june 2021 we issued the 2021 notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” the initial conversion price of the 2021 notes represented a premium of approximately 45 over the closing price of our common stock on june 8 2021 the date the 2021 notes offering was priced the net proceeds from the sale of the 2021 notes were 9867 million after deducting the offering expenses the 2021 notes will mature on june 15 2028 unless earlier converted redeemed or repurchased 

we used 850 million of the net proceeds from the 2021 notes offering to enter into separate capped call instruments “2021 capped call transactions” with certain financial institutions the 2021 capped call transactions effectively limit the premium for conversion of the 2021 notes to 100 and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2021 notes andor offset any payments we make upon conversion 

in addition we repurchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock for approximately 1800 million concurrently with the issuance of the 2021 notes 

see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—debt” for more information on the 2021 notes and 2021 capped call transactions as well as the notes issued in previous years 

etsy marketplace transaction fee increase 

we are increasing our seller transaction fee from 5 to 65 effective april 11 2022 our plan is to invest even more in making etsy the best place to run a creative business we expect to invest most of the incremental revenue from this fee increase in marketing seller tools and creating worldclass customer experiences 

key operating and financial metrics 

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health and performance of our business and allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments the financial results of depop elo7 and reverb have been included in our consolidated financial results “consolidated” from july 12 2021 july 2 2021 and august 15 2019 the dates of acquisition respectively we are providing etsycom standalone information in certain instances where particularly relevant the key operating and financial metrics we use are 



1 unaudited 

2 consolidated gms for the year ended december 31 2021 includes etsycom gms of 122 billion reverb gms of 9480 million depop gms of 2944 million and elo7 gms of 320 million 

3 consolidated active sellers and active buyers includes etsycom active sellers and active buyers of 53 million and 901 million respectively as of december 31 2021 

4 percent nonus gms was formerly referred to as percent international gms percent nonus gms for etsycom for the year ended december 31 2021 was 43 for further details refer to “nonus gms” definition below 

gms 

gross merchandise sales “gms” is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplaces within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by us gms is largely driven by transactions in our marketplaces and is not directly impacted by services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of our sellers the satisfaction of our buyers and the health scale and growth of our business we track “paid gms” for the etsy marketplace and define it as etsycom gms that is attributable to our performance marketing efforts which excludes most of our marketing investments focused on brand awareness like tv and digital video 

gms increased 32 billion to 135 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 driving this growth in gms were increases as compared to december 31 2020 in active sellers primarily due to strong growth in us sellers on the etsycom marketplace in active buyers on the etsycom marketplace and in gms per active buyer on a trailing twelve month “ttm” basis as well as the acquisitions of depop and elo7 in the third quarter of 2021 as of december 31 2021 habitual buyers or etsycom buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months grew to 81 million an increase of 26 compared to december 31 2020 additionally we experienced the following growth in both new buyer and existing buyer gms in the periods presented 



uncertainty caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic may continue to impact our business in 2022 while our growth continued in 2021 our rate of growth decelerated as compared to the rapid growth we experienced in 2020 which was driven at least in part by the pandemicrelated shift to online purchasing our growth rate may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic factors beyond our control such as inflation retail businesses reopening increased consumer spending on travel and other discretionary items and the absence of new us and other government economic stimulus programs among other things as well as an anticipated deceleration in our rate of acquisition of new buyers the effects of which may be offset to some extent by incremental gms from our recent acquisitions 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

adjusted ebitda represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net benefit provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense foreign exchange gain loss acquisitionrelated expenses nonordinary course disputes and loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted ebitda margin is adjusted ebitda divided by revenue see “nongaap financial measures” for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin including their limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

active sellers 

an active seller is a seller who has had a charge or sale in the last 12 months charges include marketplace and services revenue fees discussed in “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies—revenue recognition” in the notes to consolidated financial statements a seller is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple seller accounts and can count as a distinct active seller in each of our marketplaces as part of our commitment to integrity and transparency we continuously monitor the criteria for disqualifying a seller as an active seller commencing in the first quarter of 2021 we expanded our disqualifying criteria but we did not apply such criteria to prior periods as the impact of such criteria was immaterial to such periods additionally commencing in the third quarter of 2021 as part of our integration of the depop and elo7 marketplaces into our “house of brands” we expanded our definition of active sellers to include any seller who has had a sale in the last 12 months even if no charge was incurred in connection with the sale this update did not result in any change to prior period disclosures we succeed when sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of consumer awareness of our brands the reach of our platforms the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our business 

active buyers 

an active buyer is a buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months a buyer is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple buyer accounts and can count as a distinct active buyer in each of our marketplaces we generate revenue when buyers order items from sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platforms consumer awareness of our brands the engagement and loyalty of buyers and the health of our business 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop when calculating the percentage of mobile gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

during the year ended december 31 2021 mobile gms increased as a percentage of total gms to approximately 64 up from approximately 61 for the year ended december 31 2020 mobile gms growth during the year ended december 31 2021 was approximately 39 with mobile gms growing faster than desktop gms during the year 

nonus gms 

nonus gms formerly referred to as international gms is gms from transactions in which either the billing address for the seller or the shipping address for the buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states when calculating percent nonus gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that nonus gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2021 nonus gms increased as a percentage of total gms to approximately 42 up from approximately 36 for the year ended december 31 2020 nonus gms increased approximately 54 in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 or 49 on a currencyneutral basis driven by our fastest growing nonus trade route nonus domestic which is gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country nonus domestic gms grew approximately 77 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven primarily by growth in the etsycom marketplace and to a lesser extent our acquisitions of depop and elo7 in the third quarter of 2021 

currencyneutral gms growth 

we calculate currencyneutral gms growth by translating current period gms for goods sold that were listed in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates 

as reported and currencyneutral gms growth for the periods presented below are as follows 



key factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us including those discussed in part i item 1 “business” but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

components of our results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is diversified and generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses 

marketplace revenue  etsycom marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees an etsy seller pays for marketplace activities including 

• the 020 listing fee for each item listed for up to four months 

• the 5 transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged and where applicable an additional transaction fee of 12 or 15 related to offsite advertising “offsite ads” 

• a fee for etsy payments our payment processing product which typically varies between 30 and 45 of an item’s total sale price including shipping plus a flat fee per order that depends on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located we earn additional fees on transactions in which currency conversions are performed 

reverb fees include the 50 transaction fee that a reverb seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged and a fee for payment processing similarly depop and elo7 sellers pay a 10 and 7 transaction fee respectively for each completed transaction and also pay a fee for payment processing none of these other marketplaces charge listing fees 

services revenue  services revenue is comprised of the fees an etsy seller pays us for our optional services “services” including 

• onsite advertising services “etsy ads” which allow etsy sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results and 

• shipping labels which allows etsy sellers in the united states canada united kingdom australia and india to purchase discounted shipping labels 

across our other marketplaces reverb and elo7 offer onsite advertising services and all of our other marketplaces offer shipping labels services 

see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services credit card verification service fees credit card chargebacks to support payments revenue and costs of refunds made to buyers that we are not able to collect from sellers cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with the usage of cloud infrastructure including employee compensationrelated expenses hosting and bandwidth costs and depreciation and amortization our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes for example to the extent that payments revenue increases as a percentage of revenue there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin as our payments services are lower margin products compared to our other offerings 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of marketing product development and general and administrative expenses employee compensationrelated expenses are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories we include stockbased compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function 

marketing marketing expenses primarily consist of direct marketing expenses which largely includes digital marketing and television ad and digital video expenses digital marketing also referred to as performance marketing primarily consists of targeted promotional campaigns through electronic channels such as product listing ads search engine marketing social channels and affiliate programs which are focused on buyer acquisition and retargeting to a lesser extent direct marketing expenses also include brand marketing public relations and communications marketing partnerships and customer relationship 

management marketing expenses also include employee compensationrelated expenses to support our marketing initiatives and amortization expense related to acquired customer relationships and trademark intangible assets 

product development product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensationrelated expenses for our engineering product management product design and product research activities additional expenses include consulting costs related to the development quality assurance and testing of new technology and enhancement of our existing technology 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensationrelated expenses for our general corporate functions general and administrative expenses also include costs associated with the use of facilities and equipment including depreciation and amortization and office overhead bad debt expense digital service tax and certain professional services expenses 

other expense net 

other expense net consists of interest expense interest and other income foreign exchange gain loss and in 2020 also loss on extinguishment of debt which relates to the partial repurchase of our 2018 notes in 2020 interest expense consists primarily of noncash amortization of the debt discount amortization of debt issuance costs and coupon interest expense related to our notes with the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 202006 in the first quarter of 2021 noncash interest expense related to the notes decreased as there is no further amortization of the debt discount due to its derecognition interest expense also includes interest associated with the portion of our brooklyn headquarters lease which is accounted for as a finance lease interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest income from our investment accounts 

benefit provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate and the provision benefit for income taxes is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pretax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate taxable income and loss in each jurisdiction changes in our stock price auditrelated developments acquisitions changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the magnitude of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower 

although management believes its tax positions and related provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are fully supportable it recognizes that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations to the extent that the results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision benefit for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision and results of operations 

results of operations 

the following tables show our results of operations for the periods presented and express the relationship of line items as a percentage of revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results 



comparison of years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

revenue 

  



revenue increased 6035 million to 23 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 of which 750 consisted of marketplace revenue and 250 consisted of services revenue 

marketplace revenue increased 4427 million to 17 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this growth was substantially all due to an increase in the volume of gms on our marketplaces for the year ended december 31 2021 to a total of 135 billion and the balance was due to pricing related to our offsite ads transaction fee which was introduced in may 2020 a significant majority of the growth in volume of gms was driven by the etsy marketplace the balance was primarily due to the acquisitions of depop and elo7 in the third quarter of 2021 marketplace revenue also increased due to reverb whose revenue consisted principally of marketplace revenue 

within the increase in volume of gms transaction fee revenue increased 355 payments revenue increased 314 and listing fee revenue grew 238 yearoveryear the share of etsycom gms processed through our etsy payments platform was 92 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

services revenue increased 1608 million to 5833 million in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the growth in services revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 428 in onsite advertising revenue which represented a significant majority of the overall services revenue growth and to a lesser extent an increase in shipping label revenue of 114 from the prior year the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher click volume on etsy ads the increase in shipping label revenue was primarily driven by an increase in label volume the majority of which is driven by the increase in gms additionally services revenue increased due to the acquisitions of depop and elo7 in the third quarter of 2021 

on february 24 2022 we announced that we are increasing our etsycom seller transaction fee starting april 11 2022 from 5 to 65 the updated fee structure is intended to support increased investments in the growth and health of the etsycom marketplace we expect our new pricing model will have a positive effect on revenue 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue increased 1898 million to 6545 million in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by increased costs related to overall volume increases on our etsy and reverb marketplaces including payments processing fees and cloudrelated hosting and bandwidth costs the increase was also due to the cost of revenue associated with the depop and elo7 acquisitions including employee compensationrelated expenses and the amortization of developed technology cost of revenue increased to a lesser extent due to increased employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly driven by an increase in average headcount at etsycom and reverb additionally outsourced customer support expenses increased 

operating expenses 

there were a total of 2402 employees worldwide on december 31 2021 inclusive of reverb which had 245 employees depop which had 390 employees and elo7 which had 184 employees compared with 1414 employees worldwide on december 31 2020 

marketing 



marketing expenses increased 1540 million to 6548 million in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily as a result of increased spend in digital marketing and to a lesser extent television ad campaigns the increase in digital marketing expense was largely due to the shift to our offsite ads offering beginning in may 2020 and increased site traffic paid gms was 19 of overall gms in the year ended december 31 2021 down slightly from paid gms of 20 in the year ended december 31 2020 etsycom began charging sellers an offsite advertising transaction fee on may 4 2020 9 of etsy gms was subject to an offsite ads transaction fee in 2021 in line with 9 in the second half of 2020 the acquisitions of depop and elo7 including the amortization of acquired intangible assets and employee compensationrelated expenses also contributed to the increase in marketing expenses 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased 915 million to 2715 million in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily as a result of increased employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly driven by an increase in average headcount including an increase in headcount from the acquisitions of depop and elo7 the increase was also due to an increase in expenses for thirdparty contractors and consultants offset in part by higher capitalized website development and internaluse software costs 

general and administrative 

  



general and administrative expenses increased 1265 million to 2825 million in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to increased employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly driven by an increase in average headcount including an increase in headcount from the acquisitions of depop and elo7 and performance based restricted stock units which were granted for the first time in 2021 additionally general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisitionrelated expenses associated with the depop and elo7 acquisitions which closed in july 2021 see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 5—business combinations” for more information on acquisitionrelated expenses general and administrative expenses increased to a lesser extent due to increased digital service tax expenses primarily driven by business growth 

other income expense net 

  



other income net was 59 million in the year ended december 31 2021 which increased 642 million from other expense net of 583 million in the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the adoption of asu 202006 in the first quarter of 2021 as there was no further amortization of the debt discount related to the notes due to its derecognition and by a noncash loss on extinguishment of debt of 169 million related to the partial repurchase of the 2018 notes in 2020 which will not recur as there is no loss on extinguishment of debt under asu 202006 see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies—recently issued accounting pronouncements” for more information on the adoption of asu 202006 in addition the increase was driven by both favorable changes in us dollar euro pound sterling and canadian dollar exchange rates in the current year versus unfavorable changes in the exchange rates for the same currencies in the prior year which impact our intercompany and other nonfunctional currency cash balances resulting in a foreign exchange gain in the current year versus a foreign exchange loss in the prior year 

benefit provision for income taxes 

  



our income tax benefit and provision for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 219 million and 165 million respectively 

the primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2021 were tax benefits from employee stockbased compensation of 832 million and a benefit related to research and development tax credits of 234 million partially offset by tax expense of 728 million on income before income taxes and state tax expense of 111 million 

the primary drivers of our income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 was tax expense of 636 million on income before income taxes partially offset by tax benefits from employee stockbased compensation of 454 million 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

in this annual report we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net benefit provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense foreign exchange gain loss acquisitionrelated expenses nonordinary course disputes and loss on extinguishment of debt we also provide adjusted ebitda margin a nongaap financial measure that presents adjusted ebitda divided by revenue below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platforms 

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin can provide useful measures for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect other nonoperating expenses net of other nonoperating income including net interest expense 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stockbased compensation expense 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain loss 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect acquisitionrelated expenses 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of nonordinary course disputes 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt and 

• other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin alongside other financial performance measures including net income revenue and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda and the calculation of adjusted ebitda margin for each of the periods indicated 



1 included in interest and other nonoperating expense net is primarily noncash interest expense including amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible debt offerings which were entered into in march 2018 september 2019 august 2020 and june 2021 the adoption of asu 202006 in the first quarter of 2021 resulted in a decrease in noncash interest expense related to the notes as there was no amortization of the debt discount due to its derecognition see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies—recently adopted accounting pronouncements” for more information on the adoption of asu 202006

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months while this belief is based on our current expectations and assumptions in light of current macroeconomic conditions our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report 

historical cash flows 



net cash provided by operating activities 

our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platforms as well as associated cost of revenue and other operating expenses our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers net cash provided by operating activities in each period presented has been influenced by changes in working capital 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6516 million in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily driven by cash net income of 6277 million as a result of revenue generated on our platforms and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided 239 million in cash primarily driven by timing of payment of accrued expenses in the period 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6790 million in the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by cash net income of 5548 million as a result of increased revenue generated on our platforms and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided 1242 million in cash primarily driven by volume and timing of payment of accrued expenses in the period

critical accounting estimates and policies 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis the future effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our results of operations cash flows and financial position are uncertain however we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that certain assumptions and estimates associated with stockbased compensation income taxes the valuation of acquired intangible assets developed technology and goodwill as part of purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of goodwill leases and fair value of convertible senior notes are material in nature due to the subjectivity associated with them and have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider the assumptions and estimates associated with these as further detailed below to be our critical accounting estimates see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” for further information on our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation income taxes business combinations goodwill leases and fair value of financial instruments 

stockbased compensation 

servicebased stock options and servicebased restricted stock units “rsus” are awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and performancebased restricted stock units “pbrsus” are awarded to employees all such awards are measured at fair value at each grant date stockbased compensation cost for stock options is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected term of the option these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and these assumptions either increase or decrease our stockbased compensation expense could materially differ in the future 

• expected volatility given our sufficient trading history as of the second quarter of 2021 we calculate expected volatility based solely on the historical volatility of etsy’s stock price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants prior to the second quarter of 2021 we estimated expected volatility by taking the average historical price volatility for etsy and certain industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants 

• expected term the expected term represents the period that our stockbased awards are expected to be outstanding given that we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of our stock options beginning in the second quarter of 2021 we estimate our expected term using historical option exercise behavior and expected postvest cancellation data averaged with an assumption that recently granted options will be exercised ratably from vesting to the expiration of the stock option prior to the second quarter of 2021 we used the simplified method which represented the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option to calculate the expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our board of directors 

for these assumptions the weightedaverage used in the blackscholes optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options granted in the periods indicated were as follows 



we expect to continue to grant rsus and pbrsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

income taxes 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement the tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations while we believe our tax positions are fully supportable they may be challenged by various tax 

authorities if actual results were to be materially different than estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

business combinations 

determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue attrition rate net available cash flows discount rates royalty rate and estimated replacement costs our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable if actual results are materially lower than originally estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

valuation of goodwill 

goodwill recorded represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed it is subject to an annual impairment test and if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we are required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment a quantitative assessment for impairment requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue net available cash flows and a discount rate our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable if actual results are materially lower than originally estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

as of the annual impairment testing date in 2021 we completed a qualitative analysis for both the etsy and the reverb reporting units and completed a quantitative analysis for both the depop and elo7 reporting units the quantitative analysis assumed that the purchase consideration for the depop and elo7 acquisitions approximated fair value of each of the reporting units given the proximity to the respective acquisition dates if actual results are materially lower than originally estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

as of the annual impairment testing date in 2020 we completed a qualitative analysis for both the etsy and the reverb reporting units 

as of the annual impairment testing date in 2019 we completed a qualitative analysis for the etsy reporting unit and we determined that the estimated fair value of the reverb reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the impairment testing date accordingly we prepared a quantitative assessment for the reverb reporting unit in which determining the fair value requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue and net available cash flows and the discount rate 

we did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the three years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

leases 

leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as rightofuse “rou” assets lease obligations and if applicable longterm lease obligations lease obligations and their corresponding rou assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term as the interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable we utilize the appropriate incremental borrowing rate which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment additionally the estimates of the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term along with the estimated fair value of the real estate properties or other assets leased by us affect the recognition of a lease transaction either as an operating or finance lease which impacts the classification in our consolidated financial statements 

fair value of convertible senior notes 

in accounting for the issuance of the notes prior to 2021 and the partial extinguishment of the 2018 notes in 2020 we used estimates and assumptions to calculate the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components by measuring the fair value of similar securities the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature to measure the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature we discounted the contractual cash flows of each of the notes at an estimated interest rate for a comparable liability the carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option which does not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of each of the notes following the adoption of asu 202006 in the first quarter of 2021 we no longer consider this a critical estimate as under this standard there is no bifurcation of the liability and equity components of the notes see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” for information regarding our recently issued accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate global marketplaces our revenues are denominated in the currencies in which the seller is paid and our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located etsy processes seller charges in our sellers’ ledger currencies we have asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries in which they are recorded as a result of transacting business in multiple foreign currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms available for use in managing such risk although to date we have not entered into any derivatives or hedging transactions we may elect to do so in the future should we deem it prudent in light of our exposure 

for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease to revenue of 793 million or approximately 34 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 additionally a 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a currency exchange loss of 18 million based on balance sheet balances as of december 31 2021 this compares to a revenue decrease of 476 million or approximately 28 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and currency exchange loss of 119 million based on the same analysis performed on balance sheet balances as of december 31 2020

buyers come to the etsy marketplace to be inspired and delighted by items that are crafted and curated by our creative entrepreneurs we are focused on attracting potential buyers to etsy for everyday items that have meaning and those “special” purchase occasions that happen throughout the year these occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include items that reflect an individual’s unique style gifting that demonstrates thought and care and celebrations that express creativity and fun they can also happen many times throughout the year when a buyer is decorating a home selecting an outfit for a special event planning a celebration for a special moment or buying a gift for someone special in fact in a 2020 survey of etsy buyers 88 of buyers agreed that etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly shifted global consumer shopping behavior towards online purchases of many retail categories millions of buyers found us for the first time or discovered etsy again for many everyday items including those that were temporarily unavailable elsewhere this enabled etsy to reinforce our brand messaging by aligning “special” with everyday purchase occasions we highlighted sellers’ merchandise and categories to focus on essentials and developed a thoughtful and powerful strategy to define what “everyday” means for etsy bringing it to life in our marketing and product experiences for buyers we now have the opportunity to focus on deepening our engagement with buyers by inspiring purchases across many retail categories and shopping occasions  and well beyond how they may have thought of etsy in the past the graphic below depicts just a few examples of etsy’s relevance and we believe we can deepen engagement with buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions 

reverb which we acquired in 2019 is a leading global online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling new used and vintage musical instruments with a vibrant community of buyers and sellers all over the world reverb now a whollyowned subsidiary of etsy inc is included in all financial and other metrics unless otherwise noted 

as of december 31 2020 the etsy and reverb marketplaces connected 44 million active sellers to 819 million active buyers our buyers and sellers are located all over the world and our seven core geographic markets are the united states united kingdom germany canada australia france and india which is the most recent addition to the list in identifying our core geographies we consider locations that represent our most attractive buyer gms opportunities where we currently have or believe we can create a vibrant twosided marketplace or as in the case of india where we are making strategic investments in domestic growth there are currently nearly 87 million items for sale across many retail categories in our marketplaces in 2020 our sellers generated 103 billion of gross merchandise sales “gms” approximately 61 of which came from purchases made on mobile devices in 2020 our top six retail categories on the etsy marketplace were homewares and home furnishings jewelry and personal accessories craft supplies apparel beauty and personal care paper and party supplies and with the addition of reverb we now have a significant presence in the market for musical instruments we are a global company and 36 of our 2020 gms was generated when a seller or buyer or both were located outside of the united states 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses 

marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for marketplace activities marketplace activities include listing an item for sale completing transactions between a buyer and a seller which includes where applicable beginning in the second quarter of 2020 an additional transaction fee related to offsite advertising and using our payments platforms to process payments including foreign currency payments etsy fees include the 020 listing fee for each item listed for up to four months the 5 transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged where applicable an additional transaction fee of 12 or 15 related to offsite advertising and fees for etsy payments our payment processing product etsy began charging for offsite ads in may 2020 sellers pay etsy 12 or 15 of the value of a sale based on the seller’s volume of sales if such sale is generated from an advertisement placed by us on thirdparty internet platforms in the second half of 2020 9 of etsy gms was subject to an offsite ads transaction fee etsy payments processing fees vary between 30 and 45 of an item’s total sale price including shipping plus a flat fee per order depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located we earn additional fees on transactions in which currency conversions are performed as of december 31 2020 etsy payments was available in 45 countries and 21 currencies and nearly all sellers in countries where etsy payments is available are required to use the service in fact 92 of total gms from the etsy marketplace “etsycom gms” was processed through etsy payments in 2020 up from 89 in 2019 by october of 2020 we expanded etsy payments to 9 additional countries so gms processed through etsy payments only reflects a partial year for those countries in 2020 our ability to expand etsy payments into additional countries is dependent upon the thirdparty providers we use to support this service reverb fees include the 50 transaction fee that a reverb seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged and fees for payment processing on august 4 2020 reverb increased its seller transaction fee from 35 to 5 there are no listing fees for the reverb marketplace 

services revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for our optional services “services” which help etsy sellers generate more sales and play a key role in enabling our sellers to scale their businesses we believe we can grow seller optional paid services in three ways by expanding the utility of existing services expanding the geographic reach of existing services and launching new services offerings for the etsy marketplace primary optional services include onsite advertising services which allow etsy sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results and etsy shipping labels which allows etsy sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia to purchase discounted shipping labels during 2020 22 of active etsy sellers used our advertising platform up from 17 in 2019 in 2020 we enhanced our dynamic costperclick onsite advertising by improving the relevance of ads in search and the speed of incorporating changes in a sellers budget we also applied our improved search algorithms to etsy ads to drive ad relevance and higher clickthrough rates leading to accelerated yearoveryear revenue growth for this service our shipping label service provides etsy sellers the ability to print their shipping labels at home which reduces the cost and time it takes etsy sellers to ship items to etsy buyers and reduces the chance for administrative error through features such as auto population of shipping addresses and automatically provides buyers with tracking information when available and shipping notifications our shipping labels service also incorporates logistics solutions that help etsy sellers save time and money during 2020 22 of active etsy sellers in regions where etsy shipping labels was offered used this service while this utilization rate is down from 23 in 2019 as a result of the yearoveryear growth in active etsy sellers the total number of active etsy sellers using the service has increased for the reverb marketplace optional services include bump an onsite advertising product that enables reverb sellers to determine their own ad rates as a percentage of their item’s final sale price and reverb shipping labels which gives reverb sellers access to discounted shipping rates 

our opportunity 

we believe that the nature of commerce is continuing to evolve more people are choosing to purchase goods online and many consumers are looking for special items as an alternative to mass produced goods in 2019 etsy conducted a market opportunity analysis at that time we estimated that the online market size across a ll relevant retail categories for the etsy marketplace within six of our seven core geographic markets united states united kingdom germany canada australia and france represents a 249 billion market opportunity and a 17 trillion market opportunity when offline is included we estimated that by 2023 the online market opportunity would expand to 437 billion and 2 trillion when offline is included we have not updated this market opportunity analysis as a result of the dramatic shift to online that has occurred during 2020 nor have we included india our seventh core geographic market in this analysis

to create a flywheel that elevates the effectiveness of other channels in 2020 we launched our innovative advertising program for sellers called offsite ads in which etsy pays the upfront costs to promote etsy sellers’ listings on multiple internet platforms without any upfront costs for sellers when a shopper clicks on an offsite ad featuring a seller’s listing and purchases from their shop within 30 days of that click the seller will pay etsy a transaction fee on that order  but only when they make a sale our offsite ads program is a winwin for etsy and our sellers sellers only pay when they make a sale and the additional fee enables etsy to expand the lifetime value or “ltv” of buyers and drive more visits to the etsy marketplace in 2020 the percentage of gms attributed to performance marketing was 20 up from 15 in 2019 with the expansion in paid gms primarily driven by offsite ads our investments in performance marketing which we define as spend related to the digital acquisition of buyers adjust according to demand and scale based on incremental return

• community of players reverb has a large and passionate community of musicians and music gear lovers that engage on its platform resulting in high quality transactions and interactions for both buyers and sellers 

laying the foundation for further success we brought on a new chief executive to lead reverb and rolled out a new product experimentation process similar to etsy’s enabling the team to iterate much faster the reverb team has launched initiatives to accelerate seller sales volume including enhancing the presentation of financing options adding seller reviews to product pages offering more competitive shipping rates to buyers that purchase multiple items and increasing customer support to improve the experience for buyers and sellers these initiatives are all designed to positively impact conversion rate and order size for sellers to enable further incremental improvements to the marketplace in august 2020 reverb increased its seller transaction fee for the first time from 35 to 5  with this change reverb increased investments in marketing expanded its global customer engagement team and grew the capacity of its product team focused on creating and enhancing seller tools and services 

as the covid19 pandemic shifted consumer habits to shopping online and shelterinplace restrictions increased interest in creating and recording music at home reverb experienced an increase in sales and new buyers based on which items were popular and a significant increase in new gear sales it appears that many consumers were picking up musical instruments for the first time reverb’s fastest growing categories in 2020 included acoustic guitars synthesizers and keyboards audio interfaces often used for home recording and drum machines 

reverb believes that the pandemic accelerated the shift to buying instruments online and that this shift is likely to continue even after retailers fully reopen leveraging this momentum reverb is making investments in the marketplace to drive sustained growth over time

our passionate and engaged etsy sellers and buyers 

etsy sellers 

our sellers are the backbone of etsy’s business and what matters most to them is our community of approximately 81 million buyers in order to continue to support our sellers’ growth we are focused on making etsy the best place to start and run a creative business we serve creative artisans and entrepreneurs around the world who choose to pursue their passions offering them a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of tools and services to help them run their business and drive sales etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants and have a broad range of personal and professional goals in 2020 active sellers those who sold an item or incurred a bill charge in the last 12 months grew 635 compared to 2019 as cloth face coverings became mandatory in many geographies we mobilized our sellers to make and sell face masks on the etsy platform a category that was relatively small entering 2020 many sellers pivoted their product listings to face masks and given the ease of starting a shop on etsy we acquired new sellers reaching millions of buyers 

our 2021 seller survey found that 55 of etsy sellers are multichannel sellers and that on average etsy is their primary source of sales in 2019 the second largest channel was craft fairs and live selling events but during the covid19 pandemic many sellers focused their efforts in online channels with etsy garnering the majority share 

according to our 2021 seller survey 

• 81 identify as women 

• 69 consider their etsy shop to be a business 

• 97 run their shops from their homes 

• 82 aspire to grow their sales in the future and 

• 65 started their etsy shop as a way to supplement income 

our 2021 seller survey found that 30 of etsy sellers were pursuing their creative business as their sole occupation 



etsy buyers 

the etsy marketplace supports a community of approximately 81 million buyers who value selfexpression unique items and buying directly from creative artisans and entrepreneurs in a 2020 survey of etsy buyers 88 of buyers agreed that etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with etsy sellers etsy buyers can also purchase customized items vintage merchandise and craft supplies from etsy sellers by shopping on the etsy marketplace etsy buyers are supporting creative artisans and entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world the vast majority of visits come to the etsy marketplace from organic channels including a large portion from buyers visiting etsy directly as well as from nonpaid channels such as search social email and push notifications 

we are focused on driving more new buyers to the platform and encouraging existing buyers to purchase more often new buyers are considered unique buyers that have never made a purchase on the etsy marketplace during 2020 we had over 38 million new etsy buyers up 102 compared to last year gms from new buyers was up 94 yearoveryear and represented approximately 16 of overall etsycom gms 

gms from existing etsy buyers grew 101 yearoveryear in 2020 and represented approximately 84 of overall etsycom gms in line with last year we’ve made significant strides in reactivating buyers generating purchases from buyers who hadn’t made a purchase in a year or more we generated over 22 million reactivated buyers in 2020 growing 77 compared to the prior year of the 607 million new and reactivated buyers in 2020 approximately 17 made four or more purchases across two or more categories demonstrating encouraging signs for frequency 

repeat etsy buyers represent shoppers who made purchase s on two or more days in the previous 12 months we believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2020 on the etsy marketplace approximately 48 of our active buyers were repeat buyers an increase compared to last year we are particularly focused on converting our repeat buyers into habitual buyers or etsy buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months as of december 31 2020 habitual buyers grew to 65 million an increase of 157 compared to 2019 the growth in habitual buyers has accelerated for three consecutive quarters and is faster than overall active buyer growth indicating our efforts to convert buyers into more loyal shoppers on the etsy marketplace a re seeing signs of success 

we’ve attracted nearly 151 million total buyers on the platform unique buyers who have ever purchased on etsy since our launch in 2005 



etsy seller  buyer retention

2020 gms per buyer by cohort from 2015  2019 excluding mask gms 



our technology 

our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform to produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and test features on our website 

our use of machine learning algorithms on the etsy marketplace creates an engaging shopping experience and helps etsy sellers and etsy buyers connect across our platform we apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery processes enabling shoppers to more easily browse filter and buy that perfect item even when they may not have something specific in mind machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our etsy marketplace which we believe significantly increases the inventory available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and gives etsy sellers access to a truly global audience 

in addition our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform in february 2020 we completed our principal migration to google cloud which we believe will result in increased engineering efficiency shifting the focus from maintaining onpremise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic as the covid19 pandemic shifted consumer shopping habits to more online commerce traffic volume increased dramatically and the cloud migration enabled us to dynamically flex our infrastructure in addition to its flexible capacity we also believe the cloud will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble technology on an as needed basis for example during 2020 we processed twice as much data per search query as we did in 2019 

commitment to integrity and transparency 

members of our community rely on us to maintain trusted marketplaces the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business our policies are designed to encourage transparency among our members by clearly outlining the rights and responsibilities of sellers and buyers participating on our platform transparency within our community reflects and helps to support our own trustworthiness for example we have an impact strategy on which we provide our progress in this annual report 

on the etsy marketplace we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles which starts with our policies fundamentally we require that goods listed on etsy be handmade whether by the seller alone or with the help of a production partner vintage or craft supplies etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell 

we are focused on enhancing customer service for our sellers and buyers which we believe bolsters the trustworthiness of our marketplaces for example in 2020 we continued to evolve our offerings with zendesk to improve our customer experience we expanded 247 live chat and phone support for both our buyers and sellers our commitment to integrity and transparency came into particular focus in 2020 when the covid19 pandemic triggered the sale of masks and other covid19related products our policy and trust and safety teams agilely calibrated our policy interpretation and enforcement approaches to align with constantly evolving official guidance when etsy called for sellers to make masks to meet soaring buyer demand our trust and safety team worked to provide sellers with educational resources highlighting what is permitted to be sold on the etsy platform and best practices for listing masks in accordance with our policies in response to the social justice protests and civil unrest that began in the spring of 2020 and continued through a divisive highly polarized us election cycle our policy and trust and safety teams closely followed unfolding events and their impact on our marketplaces these teams reevaluated content on etsy in the context of emerging trends to determine whether such content violated our terms of use including our prohibited items policy and zero tolerance approach for items that promote support or glorify hate or violence or that perpetuate the spread of harmful misinformation 

we have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items listed on the etsy marketplace and etsy shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and when possible inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience 

we publish an annual transparency report which details our policy enforcement for the year on intellectual property prohibited items and requests for member information policies we’ve shared this report on our corporate website annually since 2015 and believe that publicly reporting on our enforcement efforts builds trust in our marketplace and community 

our strategy 

etsy 

our strategy is focused on growing the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies and executing upon four key initiatives to make etsy a better place to shop and sell we focus our investments in search and discovery trust and reliability marketing capabilities and seller tools and services investing in and successfully delivering on these initiatives has resulted in significant improvements to and growth of our marketplace 

in order to deliver sustainable longterm growth we are building upon this strategy to incorporate additional elements that we believe over time will make etsy a bestinclass marketplace our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on what we believe are our core competitive advantages or what we think of as our “right to win” 

the foundation of etsy’s right to win is our sellers’ collection of unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to attract new buyers increase buyer frequency encourage buyers to spend more per order fuel success for our sellers and drive growth during the covid19 pandemic in 2020 we saw the effectiveness of our right to win as our buyers came to etsy for our sellers’ unique inventory of essentials and everyday items 

the etsy marketplace has a significant number of habitual buyers etsy buyers who have purchased 200 or more on etsy and have made purchases on six or more purchase days in the last 12 months and we believe we have the ability to attract many more buyers like them and convert them into habitual buyers we believe we can deepen engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and occasions we also plan to continue supporting our sellers by creating and enhancing seller tools and services designed to help sellers scale and grow their business and drive buyer demand 

further expanding on these two primary components of our longterm strategy we will 

1 focus on the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies 

the first component and foundation of our growth strategy is our focus on the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies united states united kingdom germany canada australia france and india our core geographies are locations that meet any of the following criteria 

• represent our most attractive buyer gms opportunities 

• where we currently have or believe we can create a vibrant twosided marketplace or 

• where we’re making strategic investments in domestic growth 

we are continuing to expand our global reach a barometer of our local market vibrancy is the performance of our international domestic trade routes measured by gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country 

etsycom gms from this trade route grew approximately 182 in 2020 compared to 2019 making it the fastest growing category of international gms we see significant opportunity to deliver a more localized shopping experience to nonus buyers in the future this opportunity may include making investments in the elevation of local products and sellers in search improving nonenglish search and providing more localized marketing and campaigns 

we have buyers and sellers in nearly every country around the world and while we focus on our seven core markets we will also continue to evaluate additional geographies for strategic investments continued international expansion may require significant financial investment especially in markets where we have limited operating experience including in areas such as seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation across new languages and forming relationships with thirdparty service providers 

our growth strategy also includes investments for inorganic growth including our 2018 strategic referral agreement with dawanda in germany and the 2019 acquisition of reverb we may continue to acquire additional marketplaces or businesses that are a strategic fit for the business and brand 

2 build a sustainable competitive advantage 

as described above our right to win is centered on these four key elements 

our sellers’ collection of unique items the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our sellers’ collection of unique items sellers choose to list their collections of unique items on our marketplace because they believe that we are the best place for them to start and grow a creative business and that we have created a community that attracts supports and retains some of the world’s most talented makers the etsy marketplace features approximately 85 million items listed across multiple retail categories and boasts a large assortment of unique handmade vintage and craft supply products from all over the world in a 2020 survey of etsy buyers 88 agreed that etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else  that something “special in a sea of sameness” we believe the etsy marketplace is the only place where you can find this depth and breadth of oneofakind items including millions that can be customized and personalized the unique nature of these items requires that we invest in the other three elements of our longterm strategy search and discovery human connections and our trusted brand in order deliver a bestinclass marketplace experience 

bestinclass search and discovery we are focused on continuing to develop a search and discovery experience that unlocks the value of the unique items in the etsy marketplace with millions of items listed on etsy that don’t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit “sku” our challenge is delivering worldclass search and discovery technology that surfaces the right unique product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive sales and buyer satisfaction we are utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to help personalize the search experience and enable etsy buyers to more easily browse filter and find the item they desire 

in 2020 we significantly enhanced the search and discovery experience on the etsy marketplace as a result of migrating our search efforts to google cloud we made foundational upgrades to our search ranking algorithms which continues to enable us to provide more relevant search results to buyers on the etsy platform we continue to make progress closing the semantic gap and during 2020 we processed two times more data per search query compared to last year all of our efforts have enabled us to launch personalized search where two buyers who enter the same search query may receive different results based on their characteristics as we continue to iterate on our search initiatives our algorithms will learn and deliver a more personalized shopping experience which we anticipate will deepen buyer engagement and drive greater visit and purchase frequency 

the power of human connections our mission to “keep commerce human” is a vital part of our strategy we continue to emphasize the role that humans play in every aspect of our business what makes the etsy marketplace special isn’t just the unique items in our marketplace it’s also the stories of how those items were brought to life by the hands of real people our etsy buyer experience highlights the story behind each item and also allows etsy buyers to work with etsy sellers to personalize or customize items to their exact specifications in fact data shows that when an etsy buyer reaches out to an etsy seller with a question they are significantly more likely to purchase an item from that seller and conversion rate goes up as response time gets shorter we believe that fostering and elevating the quality of these human connections will enable us to drive buyer engagement loyalty and purchase frequency and to continue to differentiate etsy from other ecommerce platforms 

in 2020 we deepened the human connections in our marketplace by launching listing videos which help sellers showcase their products to buyers in ways they previously could not with photos while bringing their products to life as of the end of 2020 approximately 32 million sellers’ videos were uploaded our goal is to bring human connections to life through improvements in member support seller forums management our brand and marketing campaigns and other ways that we promote the etsy marketplace lastly we deepen loyalty by creating opportunities for etsy buyers to experience etsy across categories and occasions 

our trusted brand we will continue to focus on being a brand that inspires trust in our customers across the buyer journey — when they search purchase anticipate and receive their special items and all the steps in between since etsy sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items we aim to ensure that the etsy brand is recognized and valued for providing an excellent endtoend experience there are two key elements to being a trusted brand standing for something that customers understand and rely on and delivering a purchasing experience that feels safe and supportive our goal is to bolster trust in the etsy brand etsy sellers the items available on etsy and in the overall etsy experience in 2020 we leveraged reviews to help buyers make more informed purchase decisions on items they are searching for by incorporating machine learning we are now able to prioritize the most helpful reviews which are those that have substantial text images and are similar to the target listing we also continue to expand our service offerings and choice of support channels for our buyers and sellers offering a choice of channels continues to resonate well with the community as evidenced by a greater share of our buyers opting to connect with etsy by phone and chat 73 of buyer contacts in the fourth quarter of 2020 were managed by phone and chat with the balance handled in email as compared to 64 and 26 managed by phone and chat in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 respectively in addition we continue to focus on the post purchase experience including free shipping and transparent delivery and returns as of december 31 2020 66 of items on the etsy marketplace offered free shipping to us buyers 73 of us listing views were eligible to ship for free and 46 of global orders were delivered with free shipping we made significant improvements in shipping transparency as of december 31 2020 approximately 34 of us listing views had an expected delivery date 

we plan to continue to optimize the etsy buyer shopping experience to make it less fragmented and to minimize friction this will involve making sure that etsy buyers can find what they want can easily keep exploring for inspiration and have the right information to make a purchase decision at every step along the way we see significant room for additional improvements to our landing pages our ability to surface recommendations and continued improvements to reduce friction in the purchase funnel 

in addition we continue to evolve our marketing strategy and investments to reinforce our core brand promise in the minds of etsy buyers we believe that we can continue to broaden our channel mix in the marketing funnel from predominately investing in performance marketing which we expect to continue to drive buyer growth through channels such as product listings ads on google or search engine marketing our performance marketing spend adjusts naturally with demand so as consumer habits evolve and more commerce shifts from offline to online etsy stands to benefit by spending more and driving more buyers to the site we also expect to continue spending on upper funnel strategies like tv to build top of mind awareness introduce etsy for more of our buyers’ purchase occasions and better engage new and existing buyers everywhere they are  on etsy and off in addition we’re expanding into new marketing channels such as podcasts and influencer collections to engage with those celebrities and influencers who are passionate about etsy through “collections” which are limited edition exclusively curated items etsy and our sellers partner with celebrities and influencers to drive engagement reach impressions and visits we believe our marketing strategy coupled with a better user experience onsite will foster improved engagement with etsy buyers 

reverb 

there are a number of similarities between the levers of growth for the etsy and reverb marketplaces including improving search and discovery making selling and buying easier and building a global brand and user community we believe that we are just getting started in improving the virtuous cycle of growth for our marketplaces 

2020 was also a transformational year for reverb and its community of buyers and sellers as the covid19 pandemic shifted consumer habits to shopping online and shelter in place restrictions increased interest in creating music reverb experienced an increase in new buyers many of whom were novice musicians we are leveraging this momentum by fostering investments in the marketplace to drive sustained growth over time including in talent marketing and enhancing seller tools and services to build on our core strengths

we file patents and register domain names trademarks copyrights and service marks in the united states and abroad we rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks we also use internal and external brand protection mechanisms that are intended to protect our brands from misuse by third parties 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant amounts of management time and focus laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example federal and state laws in the united states eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing focus on data privacy and regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on sellers and could subject us to significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business in addition some of these requirements may introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platform and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact our business and future outlook additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws noncompliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability see “risk factors — regulatory compliance and legal risks”

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other information in this annual report on form 10k if any of these risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected as a result the price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment in addition factors other than those discussed below or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in our reports address all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

operational risks related to our business 

we have experienced rapid growth and we may not have the infrastructure human resources or operational resources to sustain continued growth at our recent pace 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business in the number of buyers and sellers and purchase frequency our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our rate of growth may decrease even if our revenue continues to grow we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future in addition our costs may increase as we continue to invest in the development of our marketplaces including our services and technological enhancements and increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and hire additional employees further the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational compliance payments and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial compliance payments and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures to support our current and future growth 

our rapid growth may make us a more attractive target to bad actors and fraudsters targeting our marketplaces and our community civil litigants and those seeking to enforce questionable intellectual property rights our increased visibility may also lead to attempts to misrepresent or mischaracterize us or our marketplaces such as on social media or via individual or coordinated campaigns this may lead to increased risks that shift more quickly than our policies enforcement mechanisms and systems can react we may not be successful in defending against these types of claims which if successful could damage our brand and our business even if we are successful in defending against these types of claims we may be required to spend significant resources in those efforts which may distract our management and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations 

if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed in addition our revenue may decline and our revenue growth rate may decelerate for a number of reasons including the abatement of covid19 pandemic and other factors described elsewhere in these risk factors for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—revenue” you should not rely on growth rates of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 

the covid19 pandemic is unprecedented and has impacted and may continue to impact our gms key metrics and results of operations in numerous ways that remain volatile and unpredictable 

the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic is severe and widespread and while the rollout of vaccines has begun the timing of vaccinations and lifting of shelter in place requirements and movement restrictions is unknown the pandemic and related government and private sector responsive actions have affected the broader economies and financial markets triggering an economic downturn which has at points adversely affected and could again adversely affect demand for products sold in our marketplaces it is impossible to predict all effects and the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic as the situation continues to evolve the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and the preventative and protective measures currently in place or which may be instituted or reinstituted in the future such as quarantines closures and movement restrictions may interfere with the ability of our sellers to deliver products to our buyers if delivery services are delayed or shut down our gms and revenue could be negatively impacted as pandemicrelated restrictions on movement ease competition may intensify as buyers return to traditional brick and mortar retail stores additionally our sales may decline if pentup demand for other discretionary spending replaces demand for online shopping 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic our employees continue to work remotely and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations if a natural disaster power outage connectivity issue or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time the increase in remote working for employees vendors or contractors may also result in increased consumer privacy it security and fraud concerns further as certain businesses return to onsite operations we may experience disruptions if our employees or thirdparty service providers’ employees become ill despite the availability of vaccines and are unable to perform their duties this may impact our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers 

our results of operations may be materially affected by adverse conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally both in the united states and internationally uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories and demand for products available in our marketplaces may be reduced our results of operations have also been positively impacted by several trends related to the covid19 pandemic including the shift from offline to online shopping fast moving dynamics in the ecommerce space retail business closures stimulus checks and emerging categories such as face masks however we expect demand for certain items like handmade masks to diminish significantly with the rollout of the vaccine and as medical grade masks become widely available it is also difficult to predict how our business might be impacted by changing consumer spending patterns when the pandemic abates factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make discretionary purchases include among others levels of employment interest rates tax rates the availability of consumer credit consumer confidence in future economic conditions and stimulus checks in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or acute recession consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected gms revenue net income and adjusted ebitda 

the uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions and the timing of vaccine rollouts herd immunity and the lifting of shelter in place restrictions in the united states and other areas of the world will likely continue to adversely impact the national andor global economy and negatively impact consumer discretionary spending even in the ecommerce space which experienced growth during the pandemic the full extent of covid19’s impact on our operations key metrics and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable including the timing of vaccine rollouts and herd immunity the occurrence of virus mutations and variants the pandemic’s impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the virus vaccines and containment all of which may vary across regions any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and ability to execute and capitalize on our strategies 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control including 

• fluctuations in gms or revenue including as a result of adverse market conditions due to the covid19 pandemic and the reopening of traditional brick and mortar retail and other options for discretionary spending as and when restrictions on movement are loosened the seasonality of market transactions and our sellers’ use of services 

• our ability to convert visits into sales for our sellers 

• the amount and timing of our operating expenses 

• our success in attracting and retaining sellers and buyers 

• our success in executing on our strategy and the impact of any changes in our strategy 

• the timing and success of product launches including new services and features we may introduce 

• the success of our marketing efforts 

• the success of our acquired businesses such as reverb which we acquired in 2019 

• adverse economic and market conditions such as those related to the current covid19 pandemic currency fluctuations and adverse global events 

• disruptions or defects in our marketplaces such as privacy or data security breaches errors in our software or other incidents that impact the availability reliability or performance of our platform 

• the impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments 

• our ability to manage our business and future growth and 

• our ability to recruit and retain employees 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results key metrics and the price of our common stock may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment due to the uncertainty caused by and the unprecedented nature of the current covid19 pandemic consumer spending patterns and the impacts of the gradual reopening of the offline economy and lessening of restrictions on movement fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate and the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results which would cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time we release earnings guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls quarterly and annual earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release for example we historically have provided annual guidance but we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance on april 2 2020 given the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic and have been providing only quarterly guidance since 

on february 25 2021 we provided guidance for the first quarter of 2021 this guidance includes forwardlooking statements based on projections prepared by our management projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change some of those key assumptions include the impact of the covid19 pandemic and its duration particularly once a vaccine becomes widely available and restrictions on movement are lifted future consumer spending patterns and the associated economic uncertainty on our business these assumptions are inherently difficult to predict particularly in the long term we intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges furthermore analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business which may form a consensus about our future performance our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the impacts of reduced movement which could adversely affect our business and future operating results there are no comparable recent events that provide insights on the probable effect of the covid19 pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we are relying on the reports and models of economic and medical experts in making assumptions relating to the duration of this crisis resumption of freedom of movement and predictions as to timing and pace of any future economic recovery if these models are incorrect or incomplete or if we fail to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on all aspects of our business or the duration of those impacts the guidance and other forwardlooking statements we provide may also be incorrect or incomplete furthermore if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts investors or other interested parties the price of our common stock could decline 

given the uncertainty surrounding the impacts and duration of covid19 the efficacy of a vaccine and the timing and impacts of the opening of freedom of movement we may continue not to provide guidance or continue to provide more limited quarterly guidance as we did in 2020 guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this risk factors section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material 

if we experience a technology disruption or failure that results in a loss of information if personal data or sensitive information about members of our community or employees is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are unable to protect against software and hardware vulnerabilities service interruptions cyber incidents ransomware security incidents or security breaches then members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability or incur additional expenses and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services we are vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks ransomware and other cyber incidents any of these occurrences could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personal or financial information of our members or employees as we grow our business expand internationally and gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we have integrated a variety of recovery systems security protocols network protection mechanisms and other security measures into our systems networks and physical facilities which are designed to protect against detect and minimize security breaches including security testing encryption of sensitive information and authentication technology we cannot assure you that such measures will be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption system failure data loss or theft or other material adverse consequences particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers organized cyber criminals and cyber terrorists 

in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future security breaches as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional inadvertent or social engineering breaches occurring through our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers in addition if our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers fail to comply with our internal security policies and practices member or employee data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

our security and access controls for our systems may not be adequate which may heighten the risk of a cyber attack or security breach among other things our applications systems networks software and physical facilities could have material vulnerabilities be breached or the personal or confidential information that we store could be otherwise compromised due to employee error or malfeasance if for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or our members to disclose information or user names andor passwords or otherwise compromise the security of our networks systems andor physical facilities additionally employees or service providers may inadvertently misconfigure resources or misdirect certain communications in manners that may lead to security incidents on which we must then expend effort and expenses to correct 

as we have moved to a fully remote work environment due to the covid19 pandemic and as the industry generally moves to online remote infrastructure for core work we and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property or user data 

a successful cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected because the techniques used by hackers change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition because any investigation of a cybersecurity incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators members of our community and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident applicable rules regarding how to respond notice to users and reporting to regulators vary by jurisdiction and may subject etsy to additional liability and reputational harm 

our production systems rely on internal technology along with cloud services and software provided by our thirdparty service providers in the event of a cyberincident even partial unavailability of our production systems could impair our ability to serve our customers manage transactions or operate our marketplaces we have implemented disaster recovery mechanisms including systems to back up key data and production systems but these systems may be inadequate or incomplete for example these disaster recovery systems may be susceptible to cyberincidents if not sufficiently separated from primary systems not comprehensive or not at a scale sufficient to replace our primary systems insufficient production and disaster recovery systems could in the event of a cyberincident harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted marketplaces 

the costs and effort to respond to a security breach andor to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions delays cessation of service negative publicity and other harm to our business and our competitive position we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices in response to a security breach or related regulatory actions or litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss compromise or unauthorized disclosure of personal data or other sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing sellers and buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face damage to our reputation potential liability regulatory investigations in multiple jurisdictions and costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted marketplaces 

we are also reliant on the security practices of our third party service providers which may be outside of our direct control additionally some of our third party service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to payment card information and other confidential and sensitive member data we may have contractual and regulatory obligations to supervise the security and privacy practices of our thirdparty service providers despite our best efforts if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or experience a cyber attack such as a breach of their networks our members’ data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed more generally our thirdparty service providers may not have adequate security and privacy controls may not properly exercise their compliance regulatory or notification requirements including as to personal data or may not have the resources to properly respond to an incident many of our service providers have moved to a remote work environment and may as a result be more vulnerable to cyber attacks 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform which can impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplaces additionally due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platform updates to parts of our code third party code and apis on which we rely and that maintain the functionality of our marketplaces and business could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platform that negatively impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplaces in some cases such as our mobile apps errors may only be correctable through updates distributed through slower third party mechanisms such as app stores and may need to comply with third party policies and procedures to be made available which may add additional delays due to app review and user delay in updating their mobile apps in addition our systems are increasingly reliant on machine learning systems which are complex and may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable these systems may inadvertently reduce the efficiency of our systems or may cause unintentional or unexpected outputs that are incorrect do not match our business goals do not comply with our policies or otherwise are inconsistent with our brand guiding principles and mission any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could also result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

we rely on google cloud for a substantial portion of the computing storage data processing networking and other services for etsycom 

google cloud platform provides a distributed computing infrastructure as a service platform for business operations and we have migrated etsy’s primary production environment and data centers to google cloud increasing our reliance on cloud infrastructure any transition of the cloud services currently provided by google cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense our products and services are in significant part reliant on continued access to and the continued stability reliability and flexibility of google cloud any significant disruption of or interference with our use of google cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed in addition if hosting costs increase over time and if we require more computing or storage capacity our costs could increase disproportionately if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of google or similar providers our business and financial condition could be adversely affected to a lesser extent reverb relies on amazon web services for some business operations and is thus subject to similar risks 

the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections within our community are important to our success our business financial performance and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of buyers and sellers if we are unable to retain our existing buyers and sellers and activate new ones our financial performance could decline 

we are focused on ensuring that our marketplaces embody our mission and values and that we deliver trust and reliability throughout the buyer and seller experiences our reputation and brand depend in part upon our ability to maintain trustworthy marketplaces and also upon our sellers the quality of their offerings their adherence to our policies and their ability to deliver a trusted purchasing experience 

we view the trustworthiness and reliability of our marketplaces as well as the connections we foster in our buyerseller communities to be cornerstones of our business and key to our success many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

• complaints or negative publicity about us our platform or our policies and guidelines even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents 

• an inability to gain the trust of prospective buyers 

• disruptions or defects in our marketplaces privacy or data security incidents website outages payment disruptions or other incidents that impact the reliability of our platform 

• lack of awareness of our policies or confusion about how they are applied 

• changes to our policies that members of our community perceive as inconsistent with their best interests or our mission or that are not clearly articulated 

• inadequacies in our terms of use 

• frequent product launches updates and experiments that could deteriorate member trust 

• a failure to enforce our policies effectively consistently and transparently including for example by allowing the widespread listing of prohibited items in our marketplaces 

• inadequate or unsatisfactory customer service experiences 

• a failure on the part of our sellers to fulfill their orders in accordance with our policies their own shopspecific policies or buyer expectations 

• a failure to respond to feedback from our community or 

• a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our guiding principles and mission 

creating a trusted brand is one of the key elements of our strategy in particular we are focused on enhancing the customer experience for both sellers and buyers we continue to evolve our offerings and invest to improve our customer experience on our marketplaces if our efforts are unsuccessful or if our customer service platform or our trust and safety program fails to meet our requirements legal requirements or our customers’ requirements we may need to quickly invest significant additional resources if we are unable to do so our ability to maintain trustworthy marketplaces attract buyers and sellers and maintain our trusted brand could be harmed 

our business financial performance and growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of buyers and sellers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active buyers and active sellers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers and buyer engagement as well as the number of active sellers and seller engagement if we are not successful in encouraging buyers to return to us and purchase items in our marketplaces more frequently and sellers to list items for sale and use our services our financial performance may be negatively impacted 

our gms and revenue is concentrated in our most active buyers and sellers the pandemic has fueled an unprecedented increase in the growth of new buyers and reactivated lapsed buyers we have also seen a higher than recent historic growth rate of new sellers if we lose those buyers or sellers due to the abatement of pandemic restrictions or otherwise our financial performance and growth could be harmed even if we are able to attract new buyers and sellers to replace the ones that we lose 

we may not be able to do so at 2020 levels they may not maintain the same level of activity and the gms and revenue generated from new buyers and sellers may not be as high as the gms and revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplaces if we are unable to retain existing buyers and sellers and attract new buyers and sellers who contribute to an active community our business financial performance and growth could be harmed 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our marketplaces is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures or due to other macro events if demand for the goods that our sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain our buyers and our business could be harmed a shift in trends away from sociallyconscious consumerism or unique or vintage goods could also make it more difficult to attract new buyers and sellers our growth would also be harmed if the shift from brick and mortar retail to ecommerce does not continue or reverses when the covid19 pandemic abates we believe that many new buyers and sellers find us by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing buyers and sellers if existing buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of competitive shipping costs delayed shipping times inadequate customer service lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by our sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us likewise if existing sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform or feel they have more attractive alternatives they may stop listing items in our marketplaces and using our services and may stop referring others to us under any of these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new buyers and sellers without incurring additional expense 

we rely on our sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to our buyers 

a small portion of buyers complain to us about their experience on our platform as a pure marketplace our sellers manage their shops most policies products and product descriptions shipping and returns as a result we may not have the ability to control important aspects of buyers’ experiences on our platform for example buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by a seller or that a seller has not been responsive to their questions similarly we occasionally identify sellers who are unable to fulfill orders in a time frame or manner consistent with buyer expectations trending sellers may experience an influx of orders that may be beyond their ability to fulfill in a timely manner for example a subset of sellers who offered cloth masks during 2020 may have experienced periods of high activity beyond their ability to fulfill as a small business while we have procedures designed to mitigate spikes in orders we cannot guarantee those procedures will be effective 

negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints or any associated enforcement action taken against sellers could reduce our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers or damage our reputation we take action against sellers who we are aware may have violated our policies however our actions may be insufficient may not be timely and may not be effective in creating a good purchase experience for our buyers 

as our marketplaces grow our controls over fraud and policy violations are important to maintaining user trust but they may not be adequate and may not be sufficient to keep up with quicklyshifting techniques used by those attempting to undertake fraudulent activity on our platform while we regularly update our processes for handling complaints and detecting policy violations these processes are by their nature imperfect in a dynamic quickly growing marketplace and include risk to us our sellers and our buyers from both underenforcement and overenforcement 

a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for our sellers and buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse our buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation while we take steps such as requiring reserves including to cover such reimbursements from some sellers based on indicia they may not be able to fulfill orders we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements when we do recover funds used to reimburse buyers from sellers it may increase general seller dissatisfaction and reduce their desire to continue selling using our platform although we are focused on enhancing customer service our efforts may be unsuccessful and our sellers and buyers may be disappointed in their experience and not return 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to our buyers could harm our sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of our sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing interruptions in sellers’ supply chain transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest for example many countries continue to experience delays in shipping due to the covid19 pandemic if buyers have a negative purchase experience whether due to delay or other reasons our reputation could be damaged 

our business depends on third party services and technology which we utilize to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform and our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon a number of thirdparty service providers such as cloud service providers marketing platforms and providers payments and shipping providers and contingent labor teams and network and mobile infrastructure providers any disruption in their services any failure on their part to deliver their services in accordance with our scale and expectations or any failure on our part to maintain appropriate oversight on these thirdparty providers during the course of our engagement with them could significantly harm our business 

we are unable to exercise significant oversight over some of these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide such as technical failures deprecation of key services privacy or security concerns our efforts to update our infrastructure or supply chain may not be successful as we may not sufficiently distribute our risk across providers or geographies or our efforts to do so may take longer than anticipated if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or supply chain or do not expand our technology infrastructure or supply chain successfully then our ability to run our marketplaces could be significantly impacted which could harm our business 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to third party services platforms and infrastructure that we rely upon to maintain and scale our platform 

our sellers and buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplaces internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in addition we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

outside of the united states it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

in addition our sellers rely on continued and unimpeded access to postal services and shipping carriers to deliver their goods reliably and timely to buyers as a result of the covid19 pandemic and other factors our sellers have experienced increased delays in delivery of their goods if these shipping delays continue or worsen or if shipping rates increase significantly our sellers may have increased costs andor our buyers may have a poor purchasing experience and may lose trust in our marketplaces which could negatively impact our business financial performance and growth 

our payments systems have both operational and compliance risks including inhouse execution risk dependency on thirdparty providers and a complex landscape of evolving laws regulations rules and standards 

our buyers primarily pay for purchases using our payments services ie etsy payments and reverb payments or paypal and in the united states may pay in installments with klarna in the united states and other countries where our payments services are available our sellers accept various forms of payments such as credit cards debit cards gift cards paypal google wallet and apple pay we plan to invest ongoing internal resources into our payments tools and infrastructure to maintain existing availability expand into additional markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers if we fail to invest adequate resources into our payments platform or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable our payments services may not function properly keep pace with competitive offerings or comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements any of which could negatively impact their usage and our marketplaces as well as our trusted brand which in turn could adversely affect our gms and results of operations 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform key components of our payments platform including payments processing and payments disbursing compliance currency exchange identity verification sanctions screening and fraud analysis if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to change or terminate it could negatively affect our sellers’ ability to receive orders or payments our buyers’ ability to complete purchases and our ability to operate our payments program including maintaining certain compliance measures including fraud prevention and detection tools this could decrease revenue increase costs lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our brand and business if we or a thirdparty payment processor suffer a security breach affecting payment card information we could be subjected to fines penalties and assessments arising out of the major card brands’ rules and regulations contractual indemnification obligations or other obligations contained in merchant agreements and similar contracts and we may lose our ability to accept payment cards as payment for our services and our sellers’ goods and services 

in addition we and our thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that negatively impact payments on our platform we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such paymentsrelated service outages and if we are unable to promptly remedy or provide an alternative payment solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses or those of our sellers could increase and it could negatively impact our sellers’ businesses or our business 

further our ability to expand our payments services into additional countries is dependent upon the thirdparty providers we use to support these services as we expand the availability of our payments services to additional markets or offer new payment methods to our sellers and buyers in the future we along with our sellers may become subject to additional and evolving regulations compliance requirements and may be exposed to heightened fraud risk which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses 

various laws and regulations govern payments and these laws are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally moreover even in regions where such laws have been harmonized regulatory interpretations of such laws may differ as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort determining whether various licensing and registration laws relating to payments apply to us as our business strategy and operations evolve any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources result in liabilities cause us significant reputational damage or force us to stop offering our payments services in certain markets additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments systems noncompliant andor less profitable 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payments service providers we are and could be subject to evolving rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard or other contractual requirements that may materially negatively impact our payments business failure to comply with these rules and requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines or negatively impact our relationship with our thirdparty payments processors 

we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements including as a result of a change in our designation by major payment card providers could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply and could require a change in our business operations in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules or payment card provider rules could lead to increased fees for us or our sellers which may negatively impact payments on our platform usage of our payments services and our marketplaces 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic political crises geopolitical changes such as brexit or other similar events 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available on our platform may be reduced this would cause our marketplace and services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and may cause consumer discretionary spending to decline for an unknown period of time we have also seen significant and rapid shifts in consumer purchasing behavior as this pandemic has evolved particularly as it relates to items sought on etsy it is difficult to predict how our business might be impacted by changing consumer spending patterns 

if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of sellers offering their goods in our marketplaces and the number of goods listed in our marketplaces could decline in addition currency exchange rates may directly and indirectly impact our business for example continuing uncertainty over rollout of the january 1 2021 trade deal between the united kingdom and the european union “brexit” as well as uncertainty about areas not covered under the agreement such as crossborder services may lead to exchange rate volatility or changes in tariffs taxes and crossborder regulations any of which could negatively impact us or our sellers 

if the us dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies particularly if there is short term volatility our foreign currency denominated gms and revenue when translated into us dollars could fluctuate significantly currency exchange rates may also dampen demand for crossborder purchases which could impact gms and revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 78 of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

any events causing significant disruption or distraction to the public or to our workforce such as natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political instability or crises terrorist attacks war social unrest or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers these events if they occur may impact buyer demand for discretionary goods impact sellers’ 

ability to run their businesses on our marketplaces and ship their goods and impact our ability to execute on our strategy any of which could negatively impact our business and financial performance 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

• complying with different and sometimes conflicting laws and regulatory standards particularly including those related to the use and disclosure of personal information online payments and money transmission intellectual property product liability consumer protection online platform liability ecommerce marketplace regulation labor and employment laws and taxation of income goods and services 

• conforming to local business or cultural norms 

• barriers to international trade such as tariffs customs or other taxes or when applicable crossborder limits placed on us technology companies 

• uncertainties on the continuing impact of pandemicrelated quarantines closures delayed or shut down delivery services and movement restrictions on operations and geopolitical events such as natural disasters pandemics terrorism and acts of war 

• varying levels of internet ecommerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure 

• potentially heightened risk of fraudulent or other illegal transactions 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds 

• exposure to liabilities under anticorruption antimoney laundering and export control laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the uk bribery act of 2010 trade controls and sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control of the us treasury department and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

• our ability to enforce contracts our terms of use and policies and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states 

• fluctuations of foreign exchange rates and 

• uncertainties and instability in uk and eu markets caused by ongoing negotiations of crossborder service agreements triggered by brexit 

our sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if our sellers are not our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to recruit and retain a diverse group of employees is important to our success 

our ability to attract retain and motivate a diverse group of employees including our management team is important to our success we strive to attract retain and motivate our employees from our office administrators to our engineers to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the number or caliber of employees we need to maintain our competitive position particularly in the uncertainty of the current macroeconomic environment we may not meet our impact goal of building diverse and inclusive workforces that are broadly representative of their communities 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

• skepticism regarding our ability to continue to accelerate gms growth in the future 

• continuing ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits 

• evolving expectations regarding the ability to work remotely 

• enhancing engagement levels among existing employees and supporting their worklife balance 

• attracting high quality talent in a timely fashion 

• retaining qualified employees who support our mission and guiding principles and continuing to do so in a remote or hybrid work environment 

• continuing to find promotion opportunities to retain key employees for leadership positions 

• hiring employees in multiple locations globally and building a diverse equitable and inclusive workforce and 

• responding to competitive pressures and changing business conditions in ways that do not divert us from our guiding principles 

filling key strategic roles including engineering and product management particularly in new york city san francisco dublin and chicago is challenging qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop retain and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines particularly in this volatile macroeconomic environment it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 

our employees are currently almost fully remote as stayathome orders and movement restrictions are lifted and we reopen our offices we may need to reexamine our long term remote versus inoffice model if our needs are not aligned with our employees’ preferences it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain employees if we do move to a more remote work model it may negatively impact our company culture 

in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief technology officer or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business further if members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties we may not be able to execute on our business strategy andor our operations may be negatively impacted other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

if we experience increased voluntary attrition in the future andor if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees in a timely fashion particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed 

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property patent filings may not be adequate alone to protect our intellectual property from time to time we acquire intellectual property from third parties but these acquired assets like our internally developed intellectual property may be held invalid be unenforceable or may otherwise not be effective in protecting our platform we rely on trade secret protection for parts of our technology and intellectual property to the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation or licensing to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world particularly as to technologies used in ecommerce and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the united states and in numerous other foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense including indirect taxes based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable or likely settlements of tax audits we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including tax collection obligations due to changes in tax law such as digital sales taxes or online sales taxes during his election campaign president joseph r biden released a roadmap of his tax plan that identified several significant modification to key provisions as well as introduction of new provisions to the us internal revenue code although it is uncertain if some or all of the identified provisions will be enacted a change in us tax law may materially and adversely impact our income tax liability provision for income taxes and effective tax rate we may also be subject to increased requirements for marketplaces to report collect remit and hold liability for their customers’ direct and indirect tax obligations or as a result of changes to regulations administrative practices outcomes of court cases and changes to the global tax framework our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by results of our business operations including changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions acquisitions investments entry into new geographies the relative amount of foreign earnings changes in foreign currency exchanges rates changes in our stock price intercompany transactions changes to accounting rules expectation of future profits changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our assessment of their realizability and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in the ordinary course of our business there are numerous transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our tax positions and related provisions reflected in the financial statements are fully supportable we recognize that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates our effective tax rate can be adversely affected 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding its filing positions timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differs from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and tax liabilities 

at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we could be subject to higher than anticipated tax liabilities as well as ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as audits close and exposures are reevaluated 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility while the indentures governing our outstanding convertible notes do not include material restrictions on our ability to pursue our business strategy our credit facility requires us to comply with and future debt instruments may require us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

• disposing of assets 

• completing mergers or acquisitions 

• incurring additional indebtedness 

• encumbering our properties or assets 

• paying dividends making other distributions or repurchasing our common stock 

• making specified investments and 

• engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

our insurance may not cover or mitigate all the risks facing our business 

while we have insurance coverage for most aspects of our business risk this insurance coverage may be incomplete or inadequate or in some cases may not be available our business has evolving risks that may be unpredictable for certain risks we face we may be required to or may elect to selfinsure or rely on insurance held by third parties legal defenses and immunities indemnification agreements or limits on liability which may be insufficient 

for example we may not have adequate insurance coverage related to the actions of third party sellers on our platform in evolving areas such as platform products liability recent decisions such as bolger v amazon suggest that platforms if they undertake certain types of retailerlike activity could be responsible for some or all liability for the actions by or products of sellers on their platform even if the platform has little or no control over those sellers’ actions or products in some circumstances a platform might be held liable for violations by sellers or their products intellectual property laws privacy and security laws product regulation or consumer protection law court decisions and regulatory changes in these areas may shift quickly both in the united states and worldwide and our insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to protect us from existing or newly developing legal risks finally while some sellers on our platform may be insured for some or all of these risks many small businesses do not carry any or sufficient insurance and even if a seller is insured the insurance may not cover the relevant loss 

these factors may lead to increased costs for insurance our increased liability increased liability or requirements on sellers on our platform changes to our marketplace or business model or other damage to our brand and reputation 

strategic risks related to our business and industry 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

operating ecommerce marketplaces is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain sellers and buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for sellers with marketplaces retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses for example in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay google or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook instagram and tiktoc she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplaces or otherwise 

we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling a seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform or enable her to sell through multiple channels such as bigcommerce wix and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain sellers based on many factors including 

• the value of our brand and its awareness 

• effectiveness of our marketing 

• the global scale of our marketplaces and the breadth of our online presence 

• our tools education and services which support a seller in running her business 

• the number and engagement of buyers 

• our policies and fees 

• the ability of a seller to scale her business 

• the effectiveness of our mobile apps 

• the strength of our community and 

• our mission 

in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of buyers a buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer including large ecommerce marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba national retail chains such as west elm walmart or target local consignment and vintage stores social commerce channels like instagram or facebook eventdriven platforms and vertical experiences like zola and wayfair resale commerce and streaming video commerce sites and apps and other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for our sellers to match as pandemicrelated restrictions on movement ease competition may intensify as buyers return to traditional brick and mortar retail stores 

we compete to attract engage and retain buyers based on many factors including 

• the breadth and quality of items that sellers list in our marketplaces 

• the ease of finding items 

• the value of our brand its trust and awareness 

• the persontoperson commerce experience 

• customer service 

• our reputation for trustworthiness 

• the effectiveness of our mobile apps 

• the availability of timely fair and free shipping offered by etsy sellers to etsy buyers 

• ease of payment 

• localization and experiences targeted based on regional preferences and 

• the availability and reliability of our platform 

many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do large widely adopted platforms may benefit from significant user bases access to user or industrywide data the ability to unilaterally set policies and standards and control over complementary services such as fulfillment advertising or onplatform apps or ecommerce transactions to the extent etsy and our sellers may rely on these competitors’ services they may unintentionally reduce our ability to service our users or intentionally seek to disintermediate etsy 

we believe that it is and that it should continue to be relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship however as the technology space is increasingly subject to regulation there is a risk that legislation and regulatory or competition inquiries even if focused on large widely adopted platforms may inadvertently impede smaller platforms and small businesses including us and our sellers for example legislation and inquiries may result in obligations with which only large platforms are situated to comply if legislation or inquiries even if focused on other entities requires us to expend significant resources in response or results in the imposition of new obligations our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep pace with technological changes and enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers our business financial performance and growth may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands and preferences and we are not able to predict the effect of these changes on our business the technologies that we currently use to support our platform may become inadequate or obsolete and the cost of incorporating new technologies into our products and services may be substantial our sellers and buyers however may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs or create value for them additionally as we invest in and experiment with new offerings or changes to our platform our sellers and buyers may find these changes to be disruptive and may perceive them negatively in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for public launch is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive gms or revenue growth may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy sellers and buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may not drive the gms or revenue that we anticipate may have lower margins than we anticipate or than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing and maintaining them which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

if the widely adopted mobile social search andor advertising solutions that we our sellers and our buyers rely on as part of our key offering are no longer available or effective or if access to these major platforms is limited the use of our marketplaces could decline 

we are dependent on widelyadopted third party platforms to reach our customers such as popular mobile social search and advertising offerings if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on these platforms or if our or our sellers’ access to these platforms is limited or if these large platforms implement features that compete with us or our sellers then our products and marketing efforts may suffer and our sellers’ ability to manage and scale their business may be harmed in addition we may not be able to deliver a rewarding experience we may have limited access to or we may be unable to invest significant time and resources towards integration with and offering our services through new or updated devices operating system versions social networks or search platforms including internet of things iot based or voice based platforms if our solutions and integrations are ineffective or unavailable then our products and marketing efforts may suffer and our sellers’ ability to manage and scale their business may be harmed as a consequence our sellers may choose to sell elsewhere and our business may suffer 

conversion rates differ between web mobile web and mobile app traffic if visits to our platform from sources with lower conversion rates such as mobile web were to increase as a percentage of overall visits it could adversely impact our conversion rate and reduce gms on our platform which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

the success of our marketplaces could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as actions taken by providers of mobile and desktop operating systems social networks or search and advertising platforms including 

• policy changes that interfere with add tolls to or otherwise limit our ability to provide users with a full experience of our platform such as for our mobile apps or social network presence 

• unfavorable treatment received by our platform especially as compared to competing platforms such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store 

• increased costs to distribute or use our platform via mobile apps social networks or established search and advertising systems 

• changes in mobile operating systems such as ios and android that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive products 

• changes to social networks that degrade the ecommerce functionality features or marketing of us or our sellers’ shops and products or 

• implementation and interpretation of regulatory or industry standards by these widely adopted platforms that as a side effect degrade the ecommerce functionality features or marketing of us or our sellers’ shops and products 

if sellers and buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our marketplaces through these widely adopted access providers our business financial performance and growth may be adversely affected 

expanding our operations outside of the united states is part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

we are focused on growing our business both inside and outside of the united states although we have a significant number of sellers and buyers outside of the united states we are a usbased company with less experience developing local markets internationally and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing operations and people over diverse geographic areas with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform and business operations to local markets 

our ability to grow our international operations may also be adversely affected by any circumstances that reduce or hinder crossborder trade for example the shipping of goods crossborder is typically more expensive and slower than domestic shipping and often involves complex customs and duty inspections and the dependency of national postal carrier systems if jurisdictions become increasingly fragmented with additional regulation of small sellers and platforms tariffs and customs that increase the cost or complexity of crossborder trade whether on the seller’s sourcing of materials or between the seller and buyer our business could be adversely impacted in addition varying quarantines closures delayed or terminated delivery services and movement restrictions related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic may interfere with our international growth strategy 

our success outside the united states also depends upon our ability to attract sellers and buyers from the same countries in order to enable the growth of local markets an inability to develop our community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets along with regulations that may favor local companies some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

despite our execution efforts the goods that sellers list on our sites may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy and reverb brands as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to our marketplaces from buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that most of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in us dollars 

continued international expansion may also require significant financial investment for example etsy has made initial investments to explore growth opportunities in india a dynamic market where we have limited operating experience to facilitate continued international expansion we plan to invest in seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect or unsuccessful 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses or assets or strategic partnerships and investments which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies or enter into strategic partnerships in the future we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or any partnerships and possible future acquisitions or relationships may disrupt our business and divert management’s time and attention acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky any future acquisitions or partnerships may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 

• integrating new businesses and technologies into our infrastructure 

• clearing any required regulatory review that may be complex costly time consuming or place additional requirements on the business 

• implementing growth initiatives 

• integrating administrative functions 

• hiring retaining and integrating key employees 

• supporting and enhancing morale and culture 

• retaining key customers merchants vendors and other key business partners 

• maintaining or developing controls procedures and policies including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as well as information privacy controls and 

• assuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before and after the acquisition including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations intellectual property infringement commercial disputes cyber attacks taxes and other matters 

we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition or partnership which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions or partnerships could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplaces and services is important to our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers one of the key parts of our strategy for the etsy marketplace is to bring more new buyers to the marketplace and create more habitual buyers by inspiring more frequent purchases across multiple categories and purchase occasions we continue to iterate on and invest in our marketing strategies which may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans 

our marketing efforts currently include search engine optimization search engine marketing affiliate marketing display advertising as well as social media mobile push notifications and email marketing if we fail to scale and deliver an effective return on investment in any of these marketing efforts it may harm our business we also engage with celebrities and influencers as part of our marketing efforts and our perceived affiliation with these individuals could cause us brand or reputational damage in the event they undertake actions inconsistent with our brand and values 

additionally we invest significantly in brand advertising via channels such as television and digital video advertising if we do not produce effective content or purchase effective air time and placement for that content it could fail to deliver a return on our investment and damage our brand andor business many of our marketing efforts include our sellers and products from their shops selected via automated systems these automated systems may not always operate effectively while both our manual and automated systems have tools and procedures designed to account for our and our partners’ policies despite our best efforts we may inadvertently include in our marketing efforts sellers or their products inconsistent with our policies brand and values which could result in failure to deliver a return on our investment media or regulatory scrutiny and damage to our brand andor business 

we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search or make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplaces and reduce the number of visits or otherwise negatively impact our marketing efforts 

we also obtain a significant number of visits from social media platforms such as facebook instagram and pinterest search engines social networks and other third parties typically require compliance with their policies and procedures which may be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities including marketing services for our sellers gms and revenue etsyprovided controls for users to limit third party advertising features the growing use of online adblocking software and technological changes to browsers and mobile operating systems may impact the effectiveness of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience fail to bring more buyers or fail to increase frequency of visits to our platform in addition ongoing legal and regulatory changes in the data privacy sphere such as the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” and the california privacy rights act of 2020 “cpra” may impact the scope and effectiveness of marketing and advertising services generally including those used on our platform 

we also obtain a significant number of visits through email marketing if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our sellers and buyers if our email subscription tools do not function correctly or if our sellers and buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected as ecommerce search and social networking as well as related regulatory regimes evolve we must continue to evolve our marketing tactics and technology accordingly and if we are unable to do so our business could be adversely affected 

some providers of consumer devices mobile or desktop operating systems and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective similarly our vendors particularly those providing advertising and analytics products and services have and may continue to modify their products and services based on legal and technical changes relating to privacy in ways that could reduce the efficiency of our marketing efforts and our access to data about use of our platform any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

enforcement of our marketplace policies may negatively impact our brand reputation andor our financial performance 

we maintain and enforce policies that outline expectations for users while they engage with our services whether as a seller a buyer or a third party additionally we prohibit a range of items on our marketplaces including but not limited to drugs alcohol tobacco weapons endangered animal products hazardous materials recalled items highlyregulated items items violating intellectual property rights of others illegal products pornography items from federallysanctioned jurisdictions hateful content and items that promote or glorify violence 

we enforce these policies in order to uphold the safety and integrity of our marketplaces engender trust in the use of our services and encourage positive connections among members of the community we strive to enforce these policies in a consistent and principled manner that is transparent and explicable to stakeholders however even with a principled and objective approach policy enforcement is a combination of human and technological review as a result there could be errors it could be subject to different or inconsistent regional consensus or regulatory standards in different jurisdictions or it could be perceived to be arbitrary unclear or inconsistent this could lead to negative public perception of our enforcement distrust from members or lack of confidence in the use of our services and could negatively impact our brand reputation in particular certain enforcement decisions even those we deem necessary for the health and safety of our marketplaces may be received negatively by stakeholders or the public such as 

• we may choose to limit or prohibit the sale of items in our marketplaces based on our policies even though we could benefit financially from the sale of those items 

• from time to time we may revise our policies in ways that we believe will enhance trust in our platform even though the changes may be perceived unfavorably such as updates to the way we define handmade 

we are subject to risks related to our environmental social and governance activities and disclosures 

we have developed an impact strategy that focuses on leveraging etsy’s core business to generate value for our community and stakeholders through positive economic social and ecological efforts our “esg metrics” our impact strategy aims to create more economic opportunity for our stakeholders ensure equitable access to the opportunities we create and build longterm resilience by fostering responsible resource use and reducing our carbon footprint we have also elected to publicly share these esg metrics and include them in this annual report on form 10k and as a result our business may face heightened scrutiny for these activities see “business—our impact strategy and progress” while selected metrics receive limited assurance from an independent third party this is inherently a less rigorous process than reasonable assurance sought in connection with a financial statement audit and such review process may not identify errors and may not protect us from potential liability under the securities laws 

if we do not demonstrate progress against our impact strategy or if our impact strategy is not perceived to be adequate our reputation could be harmed we could also damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report and demonstrate that our commitment to our impact strategy enhances our overall financial performance 

any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could impact employee engagement and retention the willingness of our buyers and sellers and our partners and vendors to do business with us or investors’ willingness to purchase or hold shares of our common stock any of which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

if we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy or if our strategy proves to be ineffective our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

our ability to execute our strategy is dependent on a number of factors including the ability of our senior management team and key team leaders to execute the strategy our ability to iterate in a rapidly evolving ecommerce landscape maintain our pace of product experiments coupled with the success of such initiatives our ability to meet the changing needs of our sellers and buyers and the ability of our employees to perform at a high level if we are unable to execute our strategy if our strategy does not drive the growth that we anticipate if the public perception is that we are not executing on our strategy or if our market opportunity is not as large as we have estimated it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders any debt financing that we may secure in the future could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures repurchasing our stock or declaring dividends it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all weakness and volatility in capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt in the future we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt when due 

our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness including the 0 convertible senior notes due 2023 we issued in march 2018 the “2018 notes” the 0125 convertible senior notes due 2026 we issued in september 2019 the “2019 notes” and the 0125 convertible senior notes due 2027 we issued in august 2020 the “2020 notes” and together with the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes the “notes” depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive in addition any required repurchase of the notes for cash as a result of a fundamental change would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business or could require us to obtain additional financing to fund the repurchase our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to 

engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations based on the daily closing prices of our stock during the quarter ended december 31 2020 holders of the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are eligible to convert their 2018 notes and 2019 notes as applicable during the first quarter of 2021 see “note 13—debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the 2018 notes and 2019 notes 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt if for example we incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt these actions may diminish our ability to make payments on our substantial debt when due 

regulatory compliance and legal risks 

failure to deal effectively with constantly evolving fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business 

we have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to ensure compliance with law including for example anticorruption antimoney laundering export control and trade sanctions requirements and we have measures in place to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity in our marketplaces however those policies procedures and measures may not always be effective further the measures that we use to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity must be dynamic and require significant investment and resources particularly as our marketplaces increase in public visibility and size bad actors constantly apply continually evolving technologies and ways to commit fraud and other illegal activity and regulations requiring marketplaces to detect and limit these activities are increasing our measures may not always keep up with these changes if we fail to limit the impact of illegal activity in our marketplaces we could be subject to penalties fines other enforcement actions andor significant expenses and our business reputation financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform certain compliance services if we or our service providers do not perform adequately our compliance tools may not be effective which could increase our expenses lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business 

our brand may be harmed if third parties or members of our community use or attempt to use etsy as part of their illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our mission and guiding principles makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by our sellers or other members of our community we expect our vendors to comply with our vendor code of conduct our seller policies promote legal and ethical business practices etsy expects sellers to work only with manufacturers who comply with all applicable laws who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions although we seek to influence we do not directly control our sellers vendors or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

we may be subject to claims that items listed by sellers in our marketplace are counterfeit infringing illegal harmful or otherwise violate our policies 

we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplaces infringe upon thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplaces along with both proactive and reactive anticounterfeiting measures that we use and continue to develop we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplaces and in certain cases closing the shops of sellers who violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability for example on the etsy marketplace we use a combination of automatic and manual tools and depend upon human review in many circumstances our tools and procedures may be subject to error or enforcement failures and may not be adequately staffed and we may be subject to an increasing number of erroneous or fraudulent demands to remove content in addition we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where laws may offer less protection for intermediaries and platforms than the united states 

under current us copyright laws such as the digital millennium copyright act § 512 et seq we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on our platform by sellers and buyers and we rely upon user content platform protections under 47 usc § 230 commonly referred to as cda § 230 that limits most nonintellectual property law claims against etsy based upon content posted by users on our platform however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and limits on platform liability for these forms of intellectual property are primarily based upon court decisions similarly laws related to product liability vary by jurisdiction and the liability of marketplace platforms for products and services of sellers while traditionally limited is subject to increasing debate in courts legislatures and with regulators these safe harbors and court rulings including analogous ones in other state and international jurisdictions may change unfavorably moreover changes focused on actions by very large platforms that perform retailerlike functions may directly or indirectly also impact us our sellers buyers and vendors 

proposed laws in europe and the united states may change the scope of platform liability and ongoing case law developments may unpredictably increase our liability as a platform for user activity in that event we may be held directly or secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement product compliance deficiencies consumer protection deficiencies privacy and data protection incidents or regulatory issues of our sellers including potentially for their conduct over which we have no control or influence 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit harmful or unlawful goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platform less userfriendly these claims or legal and regulatory changes could require the removal of noninfringing lawful or completely unrelated content which could negatively impact our business and our ability to retain sellers moreover public perception that unlicensed counterfeit harmful or unlawful items are commonly offered by sellers in our marketplaces even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

we may be involved in litigation and regulatory matters that are expensive and time consuming and that may require changes to our strategy the features of our platform andor how our business operates 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including consumer protection product liability security and privacy commercial or shareholder derivative lawsuits either individually or where available on a classaction basis we may become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny inquiries or investigations including with respect to our sellers vendors or third parties relating to broad industrywide concerns such as antitrust product liability and privacy that could lead to increased expenses or reputational damage for example while we have stated on our platform that items offered by sellers on etsy such as masks and hand sanitizers are not medicalgrade and that our sellers cannot make substantive medical or health claims we may nevertheless be subject to claims based in whole or in part on the actions of sellers in violation of that directive 

under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters any lawsuit or regulatory action to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits or regulatory actions even if nonmeritorious on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we limit certain claims against us under our terms of use including through requirements for arbitration limits on class actions limitations of liability venue selection and indemnification requirements these requirements may be subject to differing interpretations and legal frameworks in different us federal state and foreign jurisdictions or courts and may have reduced or no enforceability in some jurisdictions if these claim limitations are unavailable to us it could significantly increase our costs require significant resources across multiple jurisdictions result in complex or inconsistent decisions and subject us to forum shopping by third parties seeking jurisdictions amenable to their claims 

actions brought against us may result in lawsuits enforcement actions injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business although we establish accruals for our litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable there may be a material exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued or in excess of any loss contingencies disclosed as 

reasonably possible such loss contingencies may not be probable and reasonably estimable until the proceedings have progressed significantly which could take several years and occur close to resolution of the matter 

expanding and evolving regulations in the areas of privacy and user data protection could create technological economic and complex crossborder business impediments to our business and those of our sellers 

we collect receive store process generate use transfer disclose make accessible protect secure dispose of and share personal information confidential information and other potentially protected information necessary to provide our service to operate our business for legal and marketing purposes and for other businessrelated purposes 

data protection has become a significant issue in the united states countries in the european union and in many other countries in which we operate in addition to the actual and potential changes in law described elsewhere in these risk factors global developments in privacy and data security regulations are changing some of the ways we our sellers our vendors and other third parties collect use and share personal information and other proprietary or confidential information compliance with these changing regulations have necessitated some specific product changes for our nonus activities and required additional compliance obligations for us and for our relationships with sellers vendors and other third parties 

in the european union the gdpr contains strict requirements for processing the personally identifiable information of individuals residing in the european economic area “eea” switzerland and in a form frozen as of december 31 2020 and as further separately domestically amended the united kingdom the gdpr seeks to harmonize the data protection regulations throughout these jurisdictions the regulation contains numerous requirements and changes from previous eu law including more robust obligations on data processors greater rights for data subjects requiring potentially significant changes to both our technology and operations security and accountability obligations and significantly heavier documentation and recordkeeping requirements for data protection compliance programs specifically the gdpr introduced numerous privacyrelated changes for companies operating in the european union including greater control over personal data by data subjects eg the “right to be forgotten” increased data portability access and redress rights for eu consumers data breach notification requirements increased rules for online and email marketing compliance requirements related to our sellers vendors and third parties and stronger regulatory enforcement regimes the gdpr is subject to changing interpretations due to decisions of data protection authorities courts and related legislative efforts both euwide and in particular jurisdictions the gdpr requirements apply to some thirdparty transactions such as commercial contracts with partners and vendors and to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including user and employee information gdpr requirements may also apply depending on interpretation of its reach to some users in our worldwide community of sellers we may experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new eu sellers or current and new sellers may limit their selling into the european union due to the legal requirements compliance cost potential risk exposure and uncertainty for them in respect of their own compliance obligations with respect to gdpr in addition although our sellers are independent businesses it is possible that a privacy authority could deem us jointly and severally liable for actions of our sellers or vendors which would increase our potential liability exposure and costs of compliance which could negatively impact our business we could face potential liability regulatory investigation and costly litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance 

in the united states rules and regulations governing data privacy and security include those promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission act the electronic communications privacy act the computer fraud and abuse act california’s ccpa effective january 1 2020 and cpra effective january 1 2023 and other state and federal laws relating to privacy consumer protection and data security the ccpa and cpra introduce new requirements regarding the handling of personal information of california consumers and households including compliance and record keeping obligations the right to request access to and deletion of their personal information and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches 

other jurisdictions in the united states are beginning to expand existing regulations or propose laws similar to the ccpa if more stringent privacy legislation arises in the united states it could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally other countries outside of europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar crossborder data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency and strict limitations to the processing of personal information which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business in the past year for example brazil recently enacted the general data protection law new zealand recently enacted the new zealand privacy act china released its draft personal information protection law and canada introduced the digital charter implementation act 

gdpr ccpa and similar laws coming into effect in other jurisdictions may continue to change the data protection landscape globally may be potentially inconsistent or incompatible and could result in potentially significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business some of these requirements may introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platform and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact 

our business and future outlook beyond gdpr and ccpacpra individual jurisdictions continue to pass laws related to data protection such as data privacy and data breach notification resulting in a diverse set of requirements across states countries and regions noncompliance with these laws could result in proceedings against us by one or more data protection authorities other public authorities third parties or individuals under gdpr alone noncompliance could result in fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company whichever is greater we may not be entirely successful in our compliance efforts due to various factors either within our control such as limited internal resource allocation or outside our control such as a lack of vendor cooperation new regulatory interpretations or lack of regulatory guidance in respect of certain gdpr requirements 

in addition eu data protection laws including the gdpr also generally prohibit the transfer of personal information from europe to the united states and most other countries unless the recipient country has been deemed to have adequate privacy protections in place to protect the personal information parties transferring protected personal data to jurisdictions deemed inadequate must establish a legal basis for and implement specific safeguards for such intraparty or interparty transfers a recent judgment of the court of justice of the european union found a common basis for such transfers the euus privacy shield insufficient and a parallel arrangement with switzerland may similarly be deemed insufficient while etsy did not rely upon privacy shield for crossborder transfers reverb previously had done so while effective solutions may be available to permit these transfers such as standard contractual clauses “sccs” continuing changes to the rules related to crossborder transfers may nonetheless impede etsy and reverb’s ability to effectively transfer data between jurisdictions with parties such as partners vendors and users or may make such transfers of personal data more costly in particular another recent decision and related european commission guidance and updates to the sccs may impose additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the sccs and may require significant expense and resources associated with compliance for example transfers with the united kingdom might be deemed inadequate after its departure from the european union and european economic area and require substantial expense and resources to comply with based upon adequacy mechanisms such as sccs transfers by us or our vendors of personal information from europe pursuant to sccs may not comply with eu data protection law may increase our exposure to the gdpr’s heightened sanctions for violations of its crossborder data transfer restrictions and may result in lower sales on our platform because of difficulty of establishing a lawful basis for personal information transfers out of europe 

we also publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection processing use and disclosure of personal data although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so moreover despite our efforts we may not be successful in achieving compliance such as if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies and documentation such failures can subject us to potential international local state and federal action under both data protection and consumer protection laws we are or may also be subject to the terms of our own and third party external and internal privacy and security policies codes representations certifications industry standards publications and frameworks and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy information security including contractual obligations to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with data protection laws or other obligations 

our sellers and vendors may be subject to similar privacy requirements which may significantly increase costs and resources dedicated to their compliance with such requirements we may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches related to us or in some cases our thirdparty service providers many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals regulatory authorities and others of security breaches involving certain types of data in addition our agreements with certain stakeholders may require us to notify them in the event of such a security breach such mandatory disclosures even if only related to actions of a thirdparty vendor are costly could lead to negative publicity may cause our community members to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to andor alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach and may cause us to breach customer contracts our contracts our representations or industry standards may require us to use industrystandard or reasonable measures to safeguard sensitive personal information or confidential information a security breach could lead to claims by our community members or other relevant stakeholders that we have failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations as a result we could be subject to legal action or our community members could end their relationships with us there can be no assurance that any indemnifications limitations of liability or other remedies in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches including fines judgments settlements penalties costs attorney fees and other impacts that arise out of incidents or breaches if the impacts of a security incident or breach or the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage is of a type not subject to insurance or results in changes to our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements it could have an adverse effect on our business in addition we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage cyber coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to all or part of any future claim or loss our risks are likely to 

increase as we continue to expand grow our customer base and process store and transmit increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data 

our business and our sellers and buyers may be subject to evolving sales and other tax regimes in various jurisdictions which may harm our business 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial tax goods and services tax business tax withholding tax digital service tax gross receipt tax and tax information reporting obligations to businesses like ours and to our sellers and buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear when and how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to our sellers’ businesses in some cases it may be difficult or impossible for us to validate information provided to us by our sellers on which we must rely to ascertain any obligations that may apply to us related to our sellers’ businesses given the intricate nature of these regulations as they apply to particular products or services and that many of the products and services sold in our marketplace are unique or handmade if we are found to be deficient in how we have addressed our tax obligations our business could be adversely impacted 

various jurisdictions including the us states and eu member states are seeking to or have recently imposed additional reporting recordkeeping indirect tax collection and remittance obligations or revenuebased taxes on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce if requirements like these become applicable in additional jurisdictions our business collectively with etsy sellers’ businesses could be harmed for example taxing authorities in many us states and in other countries have targeted ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and have enacted laws and others are considering similar legislation such changes to current law or new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on our marketplaces causes our marketplaces to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers which could materially impact our business and etsy sellers’ businesses this legislation could also require us or our sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling on our marketplaces less attractive additionally the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to provide information about our buyers sellers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various authorities in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build solutions and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the applicable effective date 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and laws and regulations focused on ecommerce and online marketplaces such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability intellectual property product liability and consumer protection in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws in some cases nonus privacy data security consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more detailed or comprehensive than those in the united states and in some countries are actively enforced 

these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort in some jurisdictions these laws and regulations may be subject to attempts to apply such domestic rules worldwide against etsy or its subsidiaries and occasionally may subject us to inconsistent obligations across jurisdictions 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to online marketplaces as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by online marketplaces or ecommerce for example as described elsewhere in these risk factors laws relating to privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements that are applicable to etsy 

new platform liability laws potential amendments to existing laws and ongoing regulatory and judicial interpretation of these laws imparting liability for conduct by users of a platform may create costs and uncertainty for both etsy and sellers on our platform this may even be the case for new laws or regulations focused on other technology areas or other third parties that nonetheless indirectly or unintentionally impact us our sellers or our vendors for example the european union’s recent ecopyright and platform to business directives and pending digital services act and digital markets act may impact us directly as well as impacting our sellers and vendors in addition there have been various congressional efforts to restrict the 

scope of the protections available to online platforms for third party user content under intellectual property laws such as the digital millennium copyright act § 512 et seq or user content platform protections under 47 usc § 230 commonly referred to as cda § 230 and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could significantly decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages 

we also operate under an increasing number of regulatory regimes protecting us and our sellers and buyers worldwide such as intellectual property and anticounterfeiting laws payments and taxation competition marketplace platform regulation hate speech laws and general commerce regulation these laws and court or regulatory interpretations of these laws may shift quickly in the united states and worldwide we may not have the resources or scale to effectively adapt to and comply with any changes to these regulatory regimes which may limit our ability to take advantage of the protections these regimes offer in addition some of these changes may be at least partially inconsistent with how our platform operates especially if they are adopted in the context of or in a manner best suited for larger platforms which may make it harder for us to utilize these regimes to protect our marketplaces if we are unable to costeffectively protect our platform sellers and buyers under these regulatory regimes such as if the regulations place requirements on our sellers that they find difficult or impossible to comply with limit the functions or features our marketplace can offer or require us to take actions at a scale inconsistent with the size investment and operation of our marketplace our business could be harmed 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments or the inconsistent enforcement of such laws and regulations could impede the growth of ecommerce or online marketplaces which could have a negative impact on our business and operations examples include data localization requirements limitation on marketplace scope or ownership intellectual property intermediary liability rules regulation of online speech limits on network neutrality and rules related to security privacy or national security which may impede us our users or our vendors we could also face regulatory challenges or be subject to allegations of discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business we may be subject to regulatory requests for information or testimony related to regulatory challenges of third parties such as our competitors or our vendors which could cause us to incur significant costs and expend significant resources in response and could impact our relationship with those third parties 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not fully comply in the future particularly where the applicable regulatory regimes have not been broadly interpreted if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business our ability to rely on insurance or indemnification and other contractual remedies to limit these liabilities may be insufficient or unavailable in some cases furthermore the circumstances in which we may be held liable for the acts omissions or responsibilities of our sellers is uncertain complex and evolving for example certain laws have recently been enacted seeking to hold marketplaces like ours responsible for certain compliance obligations for which sellers have traditionally been responsible if an increasing number of such laws are passed the resulting compliance costs and potential liability risk could negatively impact our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which even if untrue could be extremely costly to defend damage our brand require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition and scale worldwide we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims third parties may have intellectual property rights that they claim cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings third parties may also allege a company is secondarily liable for intellectual property infringement or that it is a joint infringer with another party including claims that etsy is liable either directly indirectly or vicariously for infringement claims against sellers using etsy’s platform our vendors or other third parties and that statutory judicial or other immunities and defenses do not protect us any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters for claims against us insurance may be insufficient or unavailable and for claims related to actions of third parties either indemnification or remedies against those parties may be insufficient or unavailable 

some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors patent holding companies and other intellectual property rights holders have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their perceived intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought directly against us or implicating us as part of an action against third parties such as our sellers or vendors could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where we do business we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates and we contribute to open source software potentially impairing our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property 

the software powering our platform incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by us and the internet and technology industries have been interpreted by only a few court decisions and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplaces under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses in addition certain pending cases such as the google v oracle litigation currently before the supreme court may impact the breadth of software api copyright protection and thus could alter the perceived scope of some open source licenses 

to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform and availability of patches or fixes may not be consistent or quickly available as it may be subject to the continued community engagement in a particular open source project additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code similarly we may be subject to third party intellectual property claims as a user of or contributor to such open source software any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

there remains pronounced legal economic and implementation uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s departure from the european union which may be a source of instability in international markets create significant currency fluctuations adversely affect our operations in the united kingdom and pose additional risks to our business revenue and financial condition 

on january 1 2021 the united kingdom left the eu single market and customs union while the united kingdom and the european union have agreed to the terms of the united kingdom’s departure in a trade agreement there remains a continued lack of clarity about future uk laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu rules and regulations to replace or replicate including financial and banking laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics privacy and information security laws payments regulations environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws and employment laws all of which could decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom increase costs and depress economic activity additionally under the terms of the united kingdom’s departure the european union retains the right to impose tariffs if the united kingdom violates certain “level playing field” standards relating to working conditions and environmental requirements the longterm effects of brexit will depend on how uk laws and relationships evolve as well as the united kingdom’s adherence to the “level playing field” standards and how that impacts its ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries 

the united kingdom is one of our core markets we continue to monitor brexit developments so that we may adjust our business and operations as appropriate with the goal of continuing to provide services to our uk and eu buyers and sellers a failure by the united kingdom and the european union to smoothly implement the trade agreement or to negotiate favorable arrangements governing crossborder services and trade and ongoing uncertainty with respect to potential divergent regulatory standards however could significantly increase friction on crossborder trade involving uk buyers and sellers or reduce the 

number of sellers on our platform offering products between the united kingdom and the european union it may also result in additional operational financial regulatory and compliance costs to us as well as decreased revenue all of which could adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we have difficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at businesses that we may acquire or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and time consuming remedial measures further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud and individuals including employees and contractors could circumvent such controls because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

changes to the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

under accounting standards codification 47020—debt with conversion and other options “asc 47020” which is the accounting standard applied in the financial statements included in this report an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the equity components of the notes are required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we recorded interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we plan to adopt accounting standards update “asu” 202006—debt—debt with conversion and other options subtopic 47020 and derivatives and hedging—contracts in entitys own equity subtopic 81540—accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entitys own equity effective as of january 1 2021 which we expect will result in our recognizing less noncash interest expense relating to the notes in future periods 

in addition under the accounting standard applied to the financial statements included in this report our 2020 notes which may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method shares issuable upon conversion of the 2020 notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the 2020 notes exceeds their principal amount in connection with our adoption of asu 202006 we will be required to adopt the ifconverted method for computing diluted earnings per share which will result in the inclusion of additional shares in the calculation of and may adversely impact our diluted earnings per share for a discussion of certain other expected impacts of adoption of this asu s ee “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies—recently issued accounting pronouncements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other risks 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities litigation we have experienced securities class action lawsuits in the past and may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

for example since january 1 2020 our common stock’s daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 3169 to a high of 23386 through february 19 2021 the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 

• variations in our operating results and other financial and operational metrics including the key financial and operating metrics disclosed in this annual report as well as how those results and metrics compare to analyst and investor expectations 

• forwardlooking statements related to our financial guidance or projections our failure to meet or exceed our financial guidance or projections or changes in our financial guidance or projections 

• failure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock or a negative view of our financial guidance or projections and our failure to meet or exceed the estimates of such analysts 

• entry into or exit from stock market indices 

• announcements of new services or enhancements strategic alliances or significant agreements or other developments by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of mergers or acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors 

• the amount and timing of our operating expenses and the success of any costsavings actions we take 

• changes in our board of directors or senior management team 

• disruptions in our marketplaces due to hardware software or network problems security breaches or other issues 

• the strength of the global economy or the economy in the jurisdictions in which we operate particularly during the current covid19 pandemic currency fluctuations and market conditions in our industry and those affecting members of our community 

• the trading activity of our largest stockholders 

• the number of shares of our common stock that are available for public trading 

• litigation or other claims against us 

• stockholder activism 

• the operating performance of other similar companies 

• changes in legal requirements relating to our business and 

• any other factors discussed in this annual report 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial performance or growth stock prices of many internet and technology companies have historically been highly volatile 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future including as a result of conversion of the outstanding notes we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of the notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes each series of notes is convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled maturity in the event the conditional conversion features of such series of notes are triggered based on the daily closing prices of our stock during the quarter ended december 31 2020 holders of the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are eligible to convert their 2018 notes and 2019 notes as applicable during the first quarter of 2021 if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely cash to converting holders of such notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock increasing the number of outstanding shares of our common stock the issuance of such shares of common stock and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock see “note 13—debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the notes 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

the actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business specifically responding to common actions of an activist stockholder such as requests for special meetings potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming or divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company which may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our ability to continue to commit to our mission guiding principles and culture may also be questioned which could impact our ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

our stock repurchases are discretionary and even if effected they may not achieve the desired objectives 

our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to  250 million of our common stock there can be no assurance that these stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares in addition there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases in the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of recent and future employee stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock if our financial condition deteriorates or we decide to use our cash for other purposes we may suspend repurchase activity at any time 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

• provide for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time 

• permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships 

• provide that directors may only be removed for cause 

• require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan 

• eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

• provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws and 

• require advance notice for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings 

these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company by imposing certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company

overview 

business 

etsy operates twosided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers our mission is to “keep commerce human” and we’re committed to using the power of business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people around the world 

our primary marketplace etsycom is the global destination for unique and creative goods the etsy marketplace connects creative artisans and entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are intended to be special reflect their sense of style or represent a meaningful occasion our sellers are the heart and soul of etsy and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity we have a selleraligned business model we make money when our sellers make money we offer etsy sellers a marketplace with millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses 

we are focused on attracting potential buyers to the etsy marketplace for everyday items that have meaning and those “special” purchase occasions that happen throughout the year we are also focused on deepening our engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases across our many retail categories and special occasions special purchases for use in the everyday include handmade or vintage unique clothing accessories household items or furniture that the buyer wants to reflect her sense of style special purchase occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include shopping for special occasions that reflects an individual’s unique style gifting that demonstrates thought and care and celebrations that express creativity and fun buyers tell us that they come to etsy because etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else 

on august 15 2019 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of reverb holdings inc “reverb” for 2704 million net of cash acquired the reverb marketplace is a leading global online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling new used and vintage musical instruments with a vibrant community of buyers and sellers all over the world reverb now a whollyowned subsidiary of etsy inc is included in all financial and other metrics from august 15 2019 the date of acquisition unless otherwise noted 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses 

marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for marketplace activities marketplace activities include listing an item for sale completing transactions between a buyer and a seller which includes beginning in the second quarter of 2020 an additional transaction fee related to offsite advertising and using our payments services to process payments including foreign currency transactions etsy fees include the 020 listing fee for each item listed for up to four months the 5 transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged where applicable an additional transaction fee of 12 or 15 related to offsite advertising and fees for etsy payments our payment processing product 

services revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for our optional other services “services” services primarily include onsite advertising services which allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results and shipping labels which allows sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia to purchase discounted shipping labels 

our strategy is focused on growing the etsy marketplace in our seven core geographies and building a sustainable competitive advantage around four elements of our business that we believe differentiate us from our competitors or what we call our “right to win” the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of our sellers’ unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on these four elements of our business ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to drive more new buyers to the website give existing buyers reasons to come back more often encourage buyers to spend more per order and fuel success for our sellers we see a number of similarities between the levers of growth for the etsy and reverb marketplaces including improving search and discovery making selling and buying easier and building a global brand and user community 

while current macroeconomic conditions have had a dramatic effect on the global economy and on our business these impacts have led us to reaffirm our longterm strategy and strengthen our commitment to it 

year financial highlights 

as of december 31 2020 our marketplaces connected 44 million active sellers and 819 million active buyers in nearly every country in the world in the year ended december 31 2020 sellers generated gms of 103 billion of which approximately 61 came from purchases made on mobile devices we are a global company and approximately 36 of our gms in the year ended december 31 2020 came from transactions where either a seller or a buyer was located outside of the united states 

total revenue was 17 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 driven by strong growth in both marketplace and services revenue in the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded net income of 3492 million and nongaap adjusted ebitda of 5491 million see “nongaap financial measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 17 billion as of december 31 2020 etsy has 6500 million aggregate principal amount of 0125 convertible senior notes due 2027 the “2020 notes” 6500 million aggregate principal amount of 0125 convertible senior notes due 2026 the “2019 notes” and 439 million aggregate principal amount of 0 convertible senior notes due 2023 the “2018 notes” and together with the 2020 notes and the 2019 notes the “notes” additionally we have the ability to draw down on its 2000 million senior secured revolving credit facility in the year ended december 31 2020 we had positive operating cash flows of 6790 million 

other operational highlights 

the impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business continue to evolve etsy’s performance for the year was extremely strong with gms growth of 1067 and revenue growth of 1109 factors contributing to this performance included our investments in our brand and marketplace our agility in supporting our global seller community our quick and successful transition to remote work and guarding the health and safety of our team — all of which mitigated risk and maximized our financial performance in addition etsy benefited from several tailwinds including the shift from offline to online shopping specific competitive dynamics retail business closures new buyer cohorts pentup demand emerging categories such as face masks gifting trends and government stimulus 

we have continued to invest in product development making key improvements to the customer experience during the year highlights of our business initiatives during the year including those related to covid19 are outlined below 

• etsy assembled a covid19 task force in january and moved to a fully remote workforce for both etsy and reverb by early march despite this shift in working environment our team remains highly productive during this time we allocated resources to critical infrastructure improvements to more accurately categorize our inventory and are investing in longerterm initiatives such as search and frequency and are seeing encouraging data from our recent product launches 

• in living up to our mission to “keep commerce human” we introduced several initiatives during the year to support our seller community during this challenging time these included waiving fees for our new offsite ads service extending our free trial into may a onemonth grace period to give sellers extra time to pay their bills a seller guide to managing an etsy shop during covid19 and 247 member support to address any questions with their businesses delivery times and shipping issues 

• we completed the migration of seller listings to our new offsite ads an iteration on our advertising offerings to help sellers more effectively drive traffic to their listings etsy pays the upfront costs to promote etsy sellers’ listings on multiple internet platforms without any upfront costs for sellers we added enhancements to our etsy ads formerly promoted listings service improving the relevance of ads in search and the speed of incorporating changes in a seller’s budget we also made our etsy ads infrastructure more efficient providing better search results while simultaneously using fewer cloud resources to add to the seller experience we launched performance graphs in the etsy ads dashboard helping to make advertising on etsy as easy as possible for our sellers 

• we adjusted our marketing strategies and spend for the etsy marketplace during the year to respond quickly to the changing macro dynamics performance marketing spend adjusts naturally with demand and we significantly increased our investments in marketing launching several tv ad campaigns throughout the year including both direct response ads and those designed to create an emotional connection with consumers as well as holiday campaigns in the united kingdom and germany over the year we have made significant progress with full funnel marketing and optimization across channels 

• gms excluding mask sales for the etsy marketplace was 87 billion up 84 yearoveryear and 8 of the etsy marketplace’s overall gms was from mask sales the etsy marketplace saw an influx of 607 million new buyers and reactivated buyers during the year the latter being those who haven’t purchased in a year or more 

• we launched a buy now pay later option for us buyers through a partnership with klarna an online payments company which offers buyers the flexibility to pay for an item in installments making higher priced items more accessible 

• in search and discovery we made additional progress by improving our querylisting matching and continuing to iterate on ranking algorithms to deliver more relevant recommendations further along in the purchase funnel and by leaning into saved searches and favorites to capture data on what buyers like and their tastes and preferences which we believe we can leverage to make the site more organized and easier to search 

• we continued to strengthen the buyer experience by 

◦ adding a more prominent “in stock” indicator to increase buyer confidence that an item is not massproduced 

◦ collapsing the item information section on the listing page allowing for buyers to more easily find items that interest them 

◦ launching listing videos which help sellers showcase their products to buyers in ways they previously could not with photos showing their expertise in making and bringing their products to life with approximately 32 million listing videos uploaded in 2020 and 

◦ improving shipping transparency and postpurchase experiences by helping buyers better understand when they should expect an item to arrive by expanding listing coverage of expected delivery dates 

• reverb benefited from similar macroeconomic ecommerce tailwinds to etsy as well as a strong increase in gms from new buyers many of whom were novice musicians we continued to execute on product and marketing initiatives to bolster reverb’s twosided marketplace beginning on august 4 2020 reverb increased its seller transaction fee for the first time from 35 to 5 which will enable reverb to increase investments in marketing expand its global customer engagement team and grow the capacity of its team that creates and enhances seller tools and services to increase visibility of seller shops and inventory 

convertible debt 

in august 2020 we issued 6500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 the “securities act” the initial conversion price of the 2020 notes represented a premium of approximately 525 over the price of our common stock the net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 notes were 6395 million after deducting the offering expenses the 2020 notes will mature on september 1 2027 unless earlier converted or repurchased 

we used 747 million of the net proceeds from the 2020 notes offering to enter into separate capped call instruments “2020 capped call transactions” with the initial purchasers andor their respective affiliates the 2020 capped call transactions effectively limit the premium for conversion of the 2020 notes to 150 and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2020 notes andor offset any payments we make upon conversion 

in addition we paid 1372 million in cash and issued approximately 73 million shares of etsy’s common stock to repurchase 3011 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2018 notes through privately negotiated transactions 

we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2020 notes offering for general corporate purposes for more information on the 2020 notes 2020 capped call transactions and the 2018 notes see “note 13—debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

key operating and financial metrics 

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health and performance of our business and allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments the financial results of reverb have been included in our consolidated financial results from august 15 2019 the date of acquisition we are providing etsycom standalone information in certain instances where particularly relevant the key operating and financial metrics we use are 



1 unaudited 

gms 

gross merchandise sales “gms” is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplaces within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by us gms is largely driven by transactions in our marketplaces and is not directly impacted by services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of our sellers the satisfaction of our buyers and the health scale and growth of our business we track “paid gms” for the etsy marketplace and define it as etsycom gms that is attributable to our performance marketing efforts which excludes most of our marketing investments focused on brand awareness like tv and digital video 

gms increased 53 billion or 1067 to 103 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 on a currencyneutral basis excluding the direct impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth for the year ended december 31 2020 would have been 1057 or approximately 100 basis points lower than the reported 1067 growth supporting this growth in gms active sellers increased 617 to 44 million driven by strong growth in both international and us sellers and active buyers increased 767 to 819 million at december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 in the year ended december 31 2020 gms from new buyers grew 105 yearoveryear and represented approximately 16 of overall gms a slight decrease compared to last year in the year ended december 31 2020 gms from existing buyers grew 107 yearoveryear and represented approximately 84 of overall gms a slight increase compared to last year while it is difficult to predict how our business will be impacted as the covid19 pandemic runs its course and abates we currently expect a contraction of mask sales as masks become more widely available and a deceleration of new buyer growth as businesses return to onsite operations and as mask sales contract 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense foreign exchange loss gain acquisitionrelated expenses nonordinary course disputes loss on extinguishment of debt and restructuring and other exit income see “nongaap financial measures” for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda including its limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is a seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include marketplace and services revenue fees discussed in “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies —revenue recognition” in the notes to consolidated financial statements a seller is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple seller accounts and can count as a distinct active seller in each of our marketplaces we succeed when sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our business 

active buyers 

an active buyer is a buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months a buyer is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple buyer accounts and can count as a distinct active buyer in each of our marketplaces we generate revenue when buyers order items from sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of buyers and the health of our business 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop when calculating the percentage of mobile gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

during the year ended december 31 2020 mobile gms increased as a percentage of total gms to approximately 61 up from approximately 58 for the year ended december 31 2019 mobile gms growth during the year ended december 31 2020 was approximately 116 with mobile web and mobile app gms each continuing to grow faster than desktop gms during the year 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the seller or the shipping address for the buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states when calculating percent international gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 international gms remained flat as a percentage of total gms at approximately 36 international gms was up approximately 105 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 driven by our fastest growing international trade route international domestic which is gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country and by gms between us buyers and international sellers international domestic gms grew approximately 185 in 2020 compared with 2019 the increase in international gms included increases related to changes in foreign currency rates yearoveryear on a currencyneutral basis international gms growth for the year ended december 31 2020 would have been 102 

currencyneutral gms growth 

we calculate currencyneutral gms growth by translating current period gms for goods sold that were listed in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates 

as reported and currencyneutral gms growth for the periods presented below is as follows and include the operations of reverb since august 15 2019 the date of acquisition 



key factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” our primary marketplace etsycom is the largest driver of our business and thus the following key factors affecting our performance most significantly relate to the etsy marketplace 

growth and retention of active buyers and active sellers on the etsy marketplace 

our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active buyers and active sellers our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers buyer engagement active sellers seller engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace we believe two of our most significant opportunities to drive growth in our primary marketplace are to bring new buyers to etsycom and encourage existing etsy buyers to purchase more frequently we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers or buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more purchase days in the year we are also focused on keeping our best sellers on the platform and helping them grow their businesses by enhancing the seller tools and services that help drive buyer demand 

during 2020 the etsy marketplace had 38 million new etsy buyers or buyers who made their firstever purchase on etsy compared to 19 million new etsy buyers in 2019 gms from new buyers was up 94 yearoveryear and represented approximately 16 of overall etsycom gms in line with last year etsycom gms from existing buyers grew 101 yearoveryear in 2020 and represented approximately 84 of overall etsycom gms in line with last year repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2020 on the etsy marketplace approximately 48 of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months up from 41 in 2019 

habitual buyers represented approximately 8 of etsycom’s active buyers as of december 31 2020 habitual buyers grew to 65 million as of december 31 2020 an increase of 157 compared to 2019 we aim to increase repeat purchases and habitual buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions building trust in the etsy brand and removing friction from the buying experience to improve conversion rates 

to analyze our retention rates on the etsy marketplace we measure repeat activity by active buyers and active sellers 

services growth 

we have a selleraligned business model we make money when our sellers make money our goal is to enhance the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand to achieve this we continue to invest our resources in developing a cohesive platform of paid services and free tools specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses we believe we can grow our optional paid services in three ways expand the utility of existing services expand the geographic reach of existing services and launch new services offerings  as of december 31 2020 on the etsy marketplace 22 of active sellers used onsite advertising services and 22 of active sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia used etsy shipping labels 

investment in marketing 

we are focusing on initiatives to drive traffic to etsy and shape perceptions of the etsy marketplace as the goto shopping destination for everyday items that have meaning and those “special” purchase occasions that happen throughout the year in 2018 we ran our firstever etsy television advertising campaign in the united states and also began to test offline marketing campaigns we continued these marketing campaigns during 2019 and 2020 expanding our campaigns to the united kingdom and germany during 2020 we leaned more heavily into upper funnel strategies through tv digital video and paid social in 2020 we ran several campaigns and broadened our us reach to include both direct response ads and those designed to create an emotional connection with consumers and make etsy topofmind we believe these campaigns can increase brand awareness visits and purchase intent in 2020 paid gms was 20 of total etsycom gms and grew 158 compared to 2019 

in 2020 we spent 5008 million on marketing expenses or 290 of revenue up 1323 over 2019 in 2019 we spent 2156 million on marketing expenses or 263 of revenue up 364 over 2018 we increased digital marketing spend which excludes brand marketing channels such as tv by 157 in 2020 to 3447 million including 3322 million of which was spend for the etsy marketplace up 157 from 2019 

investment in technology 

our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we have made and will continue to make significant investments in our platform to attract buyers and sellers to the etsy marketplace and enhance their experience 

we completed our principal migration to google cloud in february 2020 and our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform as the covid19 pandemic shifted consumer shopping habits to more online commerce traffic volume increased dramatically and the cloud migration enabled us to dynamically flex our infrastructure in addition to its flexible capacity we also believe that the cloud will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble technology on an asneeded basis we expect to continue to enhance our search and discovery capabilities and leverage our machine learning technology to deliver an even more personalized shopping experience in the future  

in 2020 we spent 1801 million on product development expenses or 104 of revenue up 478 over 2019 and in 2019 we spent 1219 million on product development expenses or 149 of revenue up 253 over 2018 we plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our community and increase our efforts to recruit and hire employees to work on our engineering teams 

investment in connected experience—mobile and desktop 

we want to engage buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience regardless of the format mobile is integrated into everything that we do and expanding our mobile capabilities is an important focus area our mobile websites and mobile apps include search and discovery curation personalization augmented reality and social shopping features optimized for a personal mobile experience etsycom mobile gms was 62 of total etsycom gms in 2020 up from 59 in 2019 we are focused on increasi ng conversion ra tes mobile web contributes the largest share of traffic followed by desktop and our mobile app we believe growth in percentage of mobile app visits could be a tailwind to future conversion rate gains as our mobile app channel has the highest conversion rate followed by desktop and mobile web 

international growth 

our growth will depend in part on international sellers and international buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community our vision is global and local our websites are available in many languages and supports buyers and sellers in nearly every country in the world in 2018 we entered into a referral agreement with dawanda gmbh “dawanda” a privately held germanybased marketplace for gifts and handmade items as part of this agreement dawanda agreed to encourage its community of buyers and sellers to migrate to the etsy platform the referral agreement with dawanda allowed us to grow our international business by expanding our footprint in central europe particularly in germany one of our core geographic markets 

on a consolidated basis international gms wa s 36 of total gms in both 2020 and 2019 

in 2020 43 of etsy sellers were located outside the united states crossborder transactions is the largest component of international gms and we remain committed to reducing barriers such as language and currency so that sellers and buyers from different countries can easily connect and transact for the etsy marketplace gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country grew approximately 182 in 2020 compared with 2019 making it the fastest growing category of international gms the reverb marketplace has a smaller per cent of international gms relative to the etsy marketplace 

we see significant opportunity to deliver a more localized shopping experience to nonus buyers in the future this opportunity may include making investments in the elevation of local products and sellers in search improving nonenglish search and providing more localized marketing and campaigns 

our company culture 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate exceptional employees who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we believe that our actionoriented valuesbased and purposedriven work culture is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent we are focused on employee engagement which is linked with high performance retention innovation and growth we are also committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace because we firmly believe that diverse backgrounds thoughts and experiences are beneficial to innovation decision making and our business as a whole

services revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for our optional other services services primarily include onsite advertising services which allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results and shipping labels which allows sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia to purchase discounted shipping labels 

our revenue recognition policies are discussed under “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support payments revenue and costs of refunds made to buyers that we are not able to collect from sellers cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with the usage of cloud infrastructure including employeerelated expenses hosting and bandwidth costs and depreciation and amortization our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes for example to the extent that payments revenue increases as a percentage of revenue there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin as our payments services are lower margin products compared to our other offerings 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of marketing product development and general and administrative expenses employee compensationrelated expenses are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories we include stockbased compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function 

marketing marketing expenses primarily consist of direct marketing expenses which largely includes digital marketing and television ad and digital video expenses digital marketing also referred to as performance marketing primarily consists of targeted promotional campaigns through electronic channels such as product listing ads search engine marketing social channels and affiliate programs which are focused on buyer acquisition and retargeting to a lesser extent direct marketing expenses also include brand marketing public relations and communications marketing partnerships and customer relationship management marketing expenses also include employee compensationrelated expenses to support our marketing initiatives

provision benefit for income taxes 

our effective tax rate and the provision benefit for income taxes is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pretax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate taxable income and loss in each jurisdiction changes in our stock price auditrelated developments acquisitions changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the magnitude of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower 

although management believes its tax positions and related provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are fully supportable it recognizes that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations to the extent that the results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision benefit for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision and results of operations 

results of operations 

the following tables show our results of operations for the periods presented and express the relationship of line items as a percentage of revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results 



comparison of years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

revenue 

  



revenue increased 9072 million or 1109 to 17 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 of which 755 consisted of marketplace revenue and 245 consisted of services revenue 

during the second quarter of 2020 etsy transitioned from its combined “etsy ads” onsite and offsite advertising to two separate advertising offerings offsite ads with 12 or 15 transaction fees reported in marketplace revenue and etsy ads the new name for our onsite advertising product formerly promoted listings with advertising fees reported in services revenue 

marketplace revenue increased 7095 million or 1195 to 13 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 this growth was substantially all due to an increase in the volume of gms on our marketplaces for the year ended december 31 2020 to a total of 103 billion and the balance was due to pricing related to the introduction of our new offsite ads transaction fee in may 2020 a significant majority of the growth in volume of gms was driven by the etsy marketplace the balance was due to our acquisition of reverb in the third quarter of 2019 whose revenue consisted principally of marketplace revenue 

within the increase in volume of gms transaction revenue increased 1039 payments revenue increased 1201 and listing fee revenue grew 654 yearoveryear the share of etsycom gms processed through our etsy payments platform was 92 for the year ended december 31 2020 up from 89 for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the transition of sellers in eligible countries to the platform 

services revenue increased 1978 million or 880 to 4225 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the growth in services revenue was primarily driven by an increase of 835 in onsite advertising revenue which represented a significant majority of the overall services revenue growth and to a lesser extent an increase in shipping label revenue of 1477 from the prior year the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher click volume on etsy ads formerly promoted listings at december 31 2020 22 of etsy active sellers used etsy advertising services up from 17 in 2019 the increase in shipping label revenue was primarily driven by an increase in label volume the majority of which is driven by the increase in gms 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue increased 1937 million or 715 to 4647 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by increased costs related to overall volume increases on our marketplaces including payments fees and cloudrelated hosting and bandwidth costs we gained leverage as cost of revenue did not increase as fast as revenue the increase in our gross margin from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the shift to offsite ads in the second quarter of 2020 which drives revenue growth without an equal offset in cost of revenue as the expense is recorded in marketing 

operating expenses 

there were a total of 1414 employees on december 31 2020 compared with 1240 on december 31 2019 we expect an increase in employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation in 2021 primarily driven by headcount increases to support the growth in our business 

marketing 



marketing expenses increased 2852 million or 1323 to 5008 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily as a result of increased spend in digital marketing and to a lesser extent television ad campaigns the increase in digital marketing was largely due to increased site traffic and the shift to our offsite ads offering beginning in the second quarter of 2020 paid gms was 20 of overall etsycom gms in the year ended december 31 2020 up from paid gms of 15 in the year ended december 31 2019 which is a result of higher return on ad spend due to favorable competitive dynamics and the launch of offsite ads etsy began charging sellers an offsite advertising transaction fee on may 4 2020 9 of etsy gms was subject to an offsite ads transaction fee in the second half of 2020 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased 582 million or 478 to 1801 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily as a result of increased employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly driven by an increase in average headcount at etsy and the acquisition of reverb additionally we gained leverage as product development expenses did not increase as fast as revenue 

general and administrative 

  



general and administrative expenses increased 349 million or 288 to 1560 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to increased employee compensationrelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly driven by an increase in average headcount at etsy and the acquisition of reverb general and administrative expenses increased to a lesser extent due to bad debt expense which increased as a result of the growth in our business but at a slower rate than revenue and digital service tax which was new in 2020 additionally we gained leverage as general and administrative expenses did not increase as fast as revenue we expect an increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2021 related to continued growth in the business and to longterm equity incentive awards which will be granted in the first quarter of 2021 to josh silverman etsy’s president and chief executive officer 

other expense net 

  



other expense net was 583 million in the year ended december 31 2020 which increased 502 million from 81 million in the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in noncash interest expense and a noncash loss on extinguishment of debt of 169 million related to the partial repurchase of the 2018 notes the increase in noncash interest expense was primarily driven by our 2019 notes which were issued in september 2019 and had 12 month of interest expense in 2020 and to a lesser extent our 2020 notes which were issued in august 2020 and had approximately four months of interest expense in 2020 additionally there was an increase in foreign exchange loss primarily due to the change in us dollar euro pound sterling and canadian dollar exchange rates on our intercompany and other non functional currency cash balances as well as a decrease in interest and dividend income related to our investment accounts and primarily driven by a decrease in interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019 following the adoption of asu 202006 in the first quarter of 2021 we expect a decrease in noncash interest expense related to the notes as there would not be any further amortization of the debt discount due to its derecognition for more information on the adoption of asu 202006 see “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies—recently issued accounting pronouncements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

provision benefit for income taxes 

  



our income tax provision and benefit for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 165 million and 152 million respectively 

the primary drivers of our income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 was tax expense of 636 million on income before income taxes partially offset by tax benefits from employee stockbased compensation of 454 million 

the primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2019 were tax benefits from employee stockbased compensation of 163 million and a benefit related to research and development tax credit of 99 million partially offset by tax expense of 115 million on income before income taxes 

seasonality 

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased gms and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower gms and revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2020 decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quartertoquarter for all periods within 2020 other than the first quarter of 2020 generally corresponding to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue and gms growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda 

in this annual report on form 10k we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense foreign exchange loss gain acquisitionrelated expenses nonordinary course disputes restructuring and other exit income and loss on extinguishment of debt below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform 

we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges 

adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect other nonoperating expenses net of other nonoperating income including net interest expense 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stockbased compensation expense 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange loss gain 

• adjusted ebitda does not reflect acquisitionrelated expenses 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of nonordinary course disputes 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of restructuring and other exit income 

• adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt and 

• other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 



1 included in interest and other nonoperating expense net is primarily noncash interest expense including amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible debt offerings which were entered into in march 2018 september 2019 and august 2020 

2 included in depreciation and amortization is depreciation expense related to our headquarters lease which is accounted for as a finance lease additionally the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 include amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and developed technology related to the acquisition of reverb in the third quarter of 2019

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months while this belief is based on our current expectations and assumptions in light of current macroeconomic conditions our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including the rate of our gms and revenue growth the amount and timing of our investments in marketing product development future acquisitions and investments and our stock repurchase program as well as those described in “key factors affecting our performance” above and in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

historical cash flows 



net cash provided by operating activities

critical accounting estimates and policies 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with stockbased compensation income taxes including the evaluation of uncertain tax positions purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of the acquired intangibles purchased in a business combination and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases including determining the incremental borrowing rate and fair value of convertible senior notes are material in nature due to the subjectivity associated with them and have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for further information on our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation income taxes business combinations goodwill intangible assets leases and fair value of financial instruments see “note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” are awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and are measured at fair value at each grant date stockbased compensation cost for stock options is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected term of the option these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and these assumptions either increase or decrease our stockbased compensation expense could materially differ in the future 

• expected volatility as we do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for etsy and certain industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants industry peers which we have selected consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size stage of life cycle and financial leverage we expect to begin using the volatility of our own common stock share price beginning in the second quarter of 2021 as we believe we will then have a sufficient amount of historical information 

• expected term the expected term represents the period that our stockbased awards are expected to be outstanding we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our board of directors on the simplified method which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option we expect to begin using our historical share option exercise experience to estimate the expected term of our stock option grants beginning in the second quarter of 2021 

for these assumptions the weightedaverage used in the blackscholes optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options granted in the periods indicated were as follows 



we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

income taxes 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement the tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations while we believe our tax positions are fully supportable they may be challenged by various tax authorities if actual results were to be materially different than estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

business combinations intangible assets and goodwill 

etsy acquired reverb on august 15 2019 in a business combination determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and discount rates our estimates of fair value were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable if actual results were to be materially lower than originally estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

the goodwill recorded represented the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred for the business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed it is subject to an annual impairment test and if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we are required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment 

as of the annual impairment testing date in 2019 we determined that the estimated fair value of the reverb reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value due to the proximity of the acquisition date accordingly we prepared a 

quantitative assessment in which determining the fair value requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and the discount rate our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ materially from estimates if actual results were to be materially lower than estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

as of the annual impairment testing date in 2020 we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reverb reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and therefore determined that no quantitative analysis was required if actual results were to be materially lower than estimated it could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 

we did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the three years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

leases 

leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as rightofuse “rou” assets lease obligations and if applicable longterm lease obligations lease obligations and their corresponding rou assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term as the interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable we utilize the appropriate incremental borrowing rate which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment 

fair value of convertible senior notes 

in accounting for the issuance of the notes and the extinguishment of the 2018 notes discussed in “liquidity and capital resources—sources of liquidity” we used estimates and assumptions to calculate the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components by measuring the fair value of similar securities the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature to measure the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature we discounted the contractual cash flows of each of the notes at an estimated interest rate for a comparable liability the carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option which does not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as it is indexed to our own stock was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of each of the notes see “note 13—debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate global marketplaces our revenues are denominated in the currencies in which the seller is paid and our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located etsy processes seller charges in our sellers’ ledger currencies we have asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries in which they are recorded as a result of transacting business in multiple foreign currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease to revenue of 476 million or approximately 28 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 additionally a 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a currency exchange loss of 119 million based on balance sheet balances as of december 31 2020 this compares to a revenue decrease of 210 million or approximately 26 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 and currency exchange loss of 115 million based on the same analysis performed on balance sheet balances as of december 31 2019

repeat etsy buyers represent shoppers who made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months we believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2019  on the etsy marketplace approximately 414 of our active buyers were repeat buyers a slight increase compared to last year within that category we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers or etsy buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months as of december 31 2019 habitual buyers grew to 25 million  an increase of 229 compared to 2018  the growth in habitual buyers has accelerated for five consecutive quarters and is faster than overall active buyer growth indicating our efforts to convert buyers into more loyal shoppers on the etsy marketplace are seeing signs of success

our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform and capture many usergenerated events every day to produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and test features on our website 

our use of machine learning algorithms on the etsy marketplace creates an engaging shopping experience and also helps etsy sellers and etsy buyers connect across our platform we apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery processes enabling shoppers to more easily browse filter and buy that perfect item even when they may not have something specific in mind machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our etsy marketplace which we believe significantly increases the inventory available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and gives etsy sellers access to a truly global audience 

in addition our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform in late 2017 we announced our migration to google cloud which we believe will enable us to focus on growing the etsy marketplace prioritize the buyer and seller experience improve our search and discovery effectiveness and increase the pace of launching new features we achieved a significant milestone in 2019 by successfully migrating our search infrastructure to google cloud and in february 2020 we completed the migration we believe our cloud infrastructure will result in increased engineering efficiency shifting the focus from maintaining onpremise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic we also believe it will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble fulfillment to capacity on an as needed basis 

commitment to integrity and transparency 

members of our community rely on us to maintain trusted marketplaces the trustworthiness of our platform and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of sellers and buyers participating on our platform transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness for example we have an impact strategy on which we provide our progress in this annual report 

we are focused on enhancing customer service for our sellers and buyers which we believe bolsters the trustworthiness of our platform for example in 2019 we continued to evolve our offerings with zendesk to improve our customer experience we expanded live chat support to our sellers and phone support is now available for both buyers and sellers 

on the etsy marketplace we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles fundamentally we require that goods listed on etsy be handmade or unique and assembled with production partners vintage or craft supplies etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell we also annually report statistics regarding etsy shops that do not meet our guidelines or which list items that infringe third party rights 

we have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies for example our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items listed on the etsy marketplace and etsy shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience 

our strategy 

since mid2017 we have focused our strategy on growing the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies and executing upon four key initiatives to make etsy a better place to shop and sell these initiatives involved making investments and improvements in search and discovery trust and reliability marketing capabilities and seller tools and services successfully delivering on these initiatives has resulted in significant improvements to and growth of our marketplace 

in order to deliver sustainable longterm growth we are building upon this strategy to incorporate additional elements that we believe over time will make etsy a bestinclass marketplace our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on what we believe are our core competitive advantages or what we think of as our “right to win” 

the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of our seller’s unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces we lean into the humanity and vibrancy of our market increasing the connection between etsy buyers and sellers establishing strong trust signals for product quality and customer experience removing barriers to purchase and giving etsy sellers more ways to generate sales and scale their businesses 

ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to drive more new buyers to the website give existing buyers reasons to come back more often encourage buyers to spend more per order and fuel success for our sellers which we believe will drive growth the etsy marketplace has a significant number of habitual buyers etsy buyers who have purchased 200 or more on etsy and have made purchases on six or more purchase days in the last 12 months and we believe we have the ability to attract many more buyers like them to the etsy marketplace and convert them into habitual buyers for example we believe we can deepen engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions we also plan to continue supporting our sellers by focusing on enhancing the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand we see a number of similarities between the levers of growth for the etsy and reverb marketplaces including improving search and discovery making selling and buying easier and building a global brand and user community we believe that we are just getting started improving the virtuous cycle of growth for our marketplaces 

further expanding on these two primary components of our longterm strategy we will 

1 focus on the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies 

the first component and foundation of our growth strategy remains to focus on the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies united states united kingdom canada germany australia and france these six locations are where we have our largest concentrations of etsy buyers and sellers and consequently where we believe we have the most significant opportunities for growth we are building local marketplaces globally deepening local etsy communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of etsy sellers and buyers a barometer of our local market vibrancy is the performance of our international domestic trade route by which we mean gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country etsycom gms from this trade route grew approximately 37 in 2019 compared to 2018  making it the fastest growing category of international gms we see significant opportunity to deliver a more localized shopping experience to nonus buyers in the future including investments in the elevation of local products and sellers in search improving nonenglish search and more local specific marketing and campaigns 

while we focus on our six core markets we will also continue to evaluate additional geographies in which to make strategic investments for example our initial investments in india particularly in regard to seller acquisition have led to the region becoming a focus area outside of our core geographies 

our growth strategy also includes inorganic investments our 2018 strategic referral agreement with dawanda in germany and the 2019 acquisition of reverb are examples of these types of investments we may continue to acquire additional complementary marketplaces that are a strategic fit for the business and brand 

2 build a sustainable competitive advantage 

as described above the second component of our strategy is predicated around building a sustainable competitive advantage centered on these four key elements 

our collection of our sellers unique items the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of our sellers’ unique items etsy sellers’ unique items are a privilege we earn by being the best place for them to start and grow a creative business the unique nature of the inventory we sell requires investment in a distinctive set of capabilities that helps highquality items get made listed found sold and delivered through our marketplace the etsy marketplace features approximately 65 million items listed across multiple retail categories and boasts a large assortment of unique handmade vintage and craft supply products from all over the world this unique inventory is the result of having created a community that attracts supports and retains some of the world’s most talented makers in a 2019 survey of etsy buyers 88 agreed that etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else  that something “special in a sea of sameness” we believe the etsy marketplace is the only place where you can find the depth and breadth of oneofakind items including millions that can be customized and personalized the breadth and depth of the special items listed in the etsy marketplace is the linchpin of our longterm strategy however the unique nature of these items requires that we invest in the other three elements of our longterm strategy search and discovery human connections and our trusted brand in order deliver a bestinclass marketplace experience 

bestinclass search and discovery we are focused on continuing to develop a search and discovery experience that unlocks the value of the unique items in the etsy marketplace with millions of items listed on etsy that don’t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit “sku” our challenge is delivering worldclass search and discovery technology that surfaces the right product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive sales and buyer satisfaction we are utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to help personalize the search experience and enable etsy buyers to more easily browse filter and find the item they desire 

in 2019  we significantly enhanced the search and discovery experience on the etsy marketplace as a result of migrating our search efforts to google cloud we made foundational upgrades to our search ranking algorithms which will continue to enable us to provide more relevant search results to buyers on the etsycom platform we’ve transitioned from linear to nonlinear models which now leverage a deeper understanding of the relationship between items attributes and users as we continue to iterate on our search initiatives our algorithms will learn and deliver a more personalized shopping experience deepening buyer engagement and driving greater visit and purchase frequency 

the power of human connections our mission to “keep commerce human” is a vital part of our strategy we will continue to emphasize the role that humans play in every aspect of our business what makes the etsy marketplace special isn’t just the items in our marketplace it’s also the stories of how those items were brought to life by the hands of real people our etsy buyer experience highlights the story behind each item and also allows etsy buyers to create their own stories by working with an etsy seller to personalize or customize items to their exact specifications in fact data shows that when an etsy buyer reaches out to an etsy seller with a question they are significantly more likely to purchase a listing from that seller and conversion rate goes up as response time gets shorter 

in 2019  we rebranded our conversation tool on the etsy marketplace and transformed the look and feel of the interface from an emaillike platform to a chatlike experience enabling faster interactions that are more focused on shopping we believe that fostering and elevating the quality of these interactions will enable us to drive buyer engagement loyalty and purchase frequency and continue to differentiate etsy from other ecommerce platforms shifting over time from our current itemfirst framework to one that highlights etsy shops and sellers is a way to elevate the role of our makers and their creative processes our goal is to bring human connections to life through improvements in member support seller forums management our brand and marketing campaigns and other ways that we promote the etsy marketplace lastly we plan to deepen loyalty by creating opportunities for etsy buyers to experience etsy across categories and occasions 

a brand you can trust we will continue to focus on being a brand that inspires trust in our customers across the buyer journey  when they search purchase anticipate and receive their special items and all the steps in between since etsy sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items we aim to ensure that the etsy brand is recognized and valued for providing an excellent endtoend experience there are two key elements to being a trusted brand standing for something that customers understand and rely on and delivering a purchasing experience that feels safe and supportive our goal is to bolster trust in the etsy brand etsy sellers the items available on etsy and in the overall etsy experience in 2019  we implemented free shipping on the etsy marketplace by providing sellers with tools and support that enable them to offer free shipping on orders of 35 or more to us buyers in september we launched a campaign to notify etsy buyers of the new program highlighting shops that are offering free shipping on their orders as of december 31 2019 65 of items on the etsy marketplace offered free shipping to us buyers 74 of us listing views were eligible to ship for free and 48 of orders were delivered with free shipping 

we plan to continue to optimize the etsy buyer shopping experience  to make it less fragmented and to remove friction this will involve making sure that etsy buyers can find what they want can easily keep exploring for inspiration and have the right information to make a purchase decision at every step along the way we see significant room for additional improvements to our landing pages our ability to surface recommendations and continued improvements to friction in the purchase funnel by focusing on free shipping transparent delivery and returns we can help buyers better understand what to expect across the etsy marketplace 

in addition we plan to evolve our marketing strategy and investments to reinforce our core brand promise in the minds of etsy buyers we believe that we can continue to broaden our channel mix in the marketing funnel from predominately investing in performance marketing which we expect to continue to drive buyer growth through channels such as product listings ads on google or search engine marketing we also expect to continue spend on upper funnel strategies like tv expand new marketing channels such as social optimize our spend in these channels and work with sellers to help them better understand the impact of marketing on their business for example with improved seller analytics tools and to promote their shops to etsy buyers 

in addition to growth of the etsy marketplace our growth strategy includes continuing to evaluate opportunities for inorganic growth through investment including geographic expansions such as our 2018 agreement with dawanda adjacent marketplaces such as our 2019 purchase of reverb vertical marketplace extensions and technology additions to name some examples

competition 

sellers can list their goods for sale with online retailers or sell their goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram they may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover their goods in our marketplaces or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling sellers to sell from their own website or otherwise run their business independently of our platform we are able to compete for sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our marketplaces and the breadth of our online presence the number and engagement of buyers our seller tools and services our seller education resources our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers for the attention of the buyer a buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for buyers based on the unique goods that sellers list in our marketplaces our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience customer service our reputation for trustworthiness our mobile apps the availability of fair and free shipping offered by sellers ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws including patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws in the united states and abroad we also use confidentiality procedures defensive licensing and acquisitions nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect us and our intellectual property

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example us federal and state laws eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws

 item 1a risk factors  

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other information in this annual report on form 10k  if any of these risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected as a result the price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment in addition factors other than those discussed below or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in our reports address all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks related to our business and industry 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

in addition we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

if we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy or if our strategy proves to be ineffective our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

  

our ability to execute our strategy is dependent on a number of factors including the ability of our senior management team and key team leaders to execute the strategy our ability to maintain our pace of product experiments coupled with the success of such initiatives and our ability to meet the changing needs of our sellers and buyers and the ability of our employees to perform at a high level if we are unable to execute our strategy if our strategy does not drive the growth that we anticipate if the public perception is that we are not executing on our strategy or if our market opportunity is not as large as we have estimated it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our business financial performance and growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of buyers and sellers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active buyers and active sellers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers and buyer engagement as well as the number of active sellers and seller engagement we must encourage buyers to return to us and purchase items in our marketplaces more frequently we must also continue to encourage our sellers to list items for sale and use our services 

we believe that many new buyers and sellers find us by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing buyers and sellers if existing buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of competitive shipping costs inadequate customer service lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by our sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us likewise if existing sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform they may stop listing items in our marketplaces and using our services and may stop referring others to us under any of these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new buyers and sellers without incurring additional expense 

our gms and revenue is concentrated in our most active buyers and sellers if we lose those buyers and sellers our financial performance and growth could be harmed even if we are able to attract new buyers and sellers to replace the ones that we lose they may not maintain the same level of activity and the gms and revenue generated from new buyers and sellers may not be as high as the gms and revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplaces if we are unable to retain existing buyers and sellers and attract new buyers and sellers who contribute to an active community our business financial performance and growth would be harmed 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our marketplaces is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures if demand for the goods that our sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain our buyers and our business would be harmed trends in sociallyconscious consumerism and buying unique or vintage rather than mass produced goods which has historically been beneficial to our business could also shift or slow which would make it more difficult to attract new buyers and sellers in addition our growth would also be harmed if the shift from brick and mortar retail to ecommerce does not continue 

our company has only recently become profitable and we may not maintain the current rate of revenue growth or profitability in the future 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business in the number of buyers and sellers and in the number of countries in which we have sellers and buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future our costs may increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform including our services and technological enhancements and increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and hire additional employees further the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures in line with our current growth if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed in addition our revenue may decline and our revenue growth rate may decelerate for a number of reasons including the deceleration of our gms growth rate and other factors described elsewhere in these risk factors for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “ management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue ” you should not rely on growth rates of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns natural disasters public health crises political crises or other unexpected events 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available in our platform may be reduced this would cause our marketplace and services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business conversely if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of sellers offering their goods in our marketplaces could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplaces could decline in addition currency exchange rates may directly and indirectly impact our business for example continued uncertainty around the united kingdom’s exit from the european union or eu commonly referred to as brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility which may strengthen the us dollar against foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies our translation of foreign currency denominated gms and revenue will result in lower us denominated gms and revenue currency exchange rates may also dampen demand from buyers outside the united states for goods denominated in us dollars which could impact gms and revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 81 of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political instability or crises terrorist attacks war or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers certain events such as hurricanes and other natural disasters political instability or crises public health crises and significant news items in the united states or internationally that distract the public may impact buyer behavior for discretionary goods and sellers’ ability to run their businesses on our marketplaces and ship their goods which may increase seller defaults and delinquencies these kinds of events may also impact consumer perceptions of wellbeing and security which may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending if any of these events occurs our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success 

our ability to attract retain and motivate employees including our management team is important to our success we strive to attract retain and motivate employees from our office administrators to our engineers to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the number or caliber of employees we need to maintain our competitive position 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

 filling engineering product management and other technical positions particularly in new york city san francisco and chicago is challenging qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 

in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief technology officer or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business other companies including our competitors 

may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

if we experience increased voluntary attrition in the future and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed 

the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections within our community are important to our success if we are unable to maintain them our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers could suffer 

we are focused on ensuring that our marketplaces embody our valuesbased culture and that we deliver trust and reliability throughout the buyer experience our reputation depends upon our sellers the quality of their offerings and their adherence to our policies 

the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

 creating a trusted brand is one of the key elements of our strategy in particular we are focused on enhancing customer service for sellers and buyers for example in 2019 we continued to evolve our offerings with zendesk to improve our customer experience on the etsy marketplace in addition we plan to introduce new customer service features and tools to support a positive user experience on the etsy marketplace if our efforts to enhance customer service are unsuccessful or if our customer service platform fails to meet our needs we may need to invest additional resources in customer service and our ability to maintain trustworthy marketplaces could be harmed 

if we are unable to maintain trustworthy marketplaces and encourage connections among members of our community then our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep pace with technological changes and enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers our business financial performance and growth may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands and we are not able to predict the effect of these changes on our business the technologies that we currently use to support our platform may become inadequate or obsolete and the cost of incorporating new technologies into our products and services may be substantial we strive to respond to evolving customer needs and regularly launch new products features and services including for example etsy’s free shipping initiative and the planned changes to our advertising products expected to launch in the second quarter of 2020 our sellers and buyers however may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new 

offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs or create value for them additionally as we experiment with new offerings or changes to our platform our sellers and buyers may find these changes to be disruptive and may perceive them negatively in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for public launch is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive gms or revenue growth may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy sellers and buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may not drive the gms or revenue that we anticipate may have lower margins than we anticipate or than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing and maintaining them which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplaces and services is important to our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers one of the key parts of our strategy for the etsy marketplace is to bring more new buyers to the marketplace and create more habitual buyers by inspiring purchases across multiple categories and special occasions 

we continue to iterate on our marketing strategies which may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans external factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives our primary marketing efforts currently include search engine optimization search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as social media mobile push notifications and email additionally we engage in brand advertising via channels such as television and digital video advertising we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplaces and therefore reduce the number of visits to our marketplaces we also obtain a significant number of visits from social media platforms such as facebook instagram and pinterest search engines social networks and other thirdparties typically require compliance with their policies and procedures which may be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities including marketing services for our sellers and gms the growing use of online adblocking software including on mobile devices may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more buyers to our platform in addition ongoing privacy regulatory changes such as the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” and california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” may impact the scope and effectiveness of marketing and advertising services generally including those used on our platform 

we also obtain a significant number of visits through email if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our sellers and buyers or if our sellers and buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected as ecommerce search and social networking evolve we must continue to evolve our marketing tactics accordingly and if we are unable to do so our business could be adversely affected 

if the mobile solutions available to sellers and buyers are not effective the use of our marketplaces could decline 

purchases made on mobile devices by consumers including our buyers have increased significantly in recent years the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing our sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices our sellers’ ability to manage and scale their businesses may be harmed and consequently our business may suffer further although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both sellers and buyers who visit our mobile websites using a browser on their mobile device we depend on our sellers and buyers using our mobile apps for the optimal mobile experience mobile web conversion rate is lower than our desktop and buy on etsy app conversion rates therefore if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains and result in less gms and revenue for us 

as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them in addition supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources 

the success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as 

 if sellers and buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices our business financial performance and growth may be adversely affected 

expanding our community outside of the united states is part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

our vision is both global and local and we are focused on growing our business outside of the united states although we have a significant number of sellers and buyers outside of the united states we are a usbased company with less experience developing local markets outside the united states and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform to local markets 

despite our execution efforts the goods that sellers list on our sites may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy and reverb brands as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to our marketplaces from buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that most of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in us dollars 

our ability to grow our international operations may also be adversely affected by any circumstances that reduce or hinder crossborder trade for example the shipping of goods crossborder is typically more expensive and slower than domestic shipping and often involves complex customs and duty inspections and the dependency of national postal carrier systems if jurisdictions become increasingly fragmented with additional tariffs and customs that increase the cost or complexity of crossborder trade whether on the seller’s sourcing of materials or between the seller and buyer our business could be adversely impacted 

our success outside the united states depends upon our ability to attract sellers and buyers from the same countries in order to enable the growth of local markets if we are not able to expand outside of the united states successfully our growth prospects could be harmed an inability to develop our community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states on a costeffective basis could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

continued expansion outside of the united states may also require significant financial investment for example in june 2018 we announced a referral agreement with dawanda a german ecommerce marketplace which encouraged the migration of dawanda buyers and sellers to etsy’s marketplace and helped expand etsy’s presence in central europe etsy also made initial investments to explore growth opportunities in india a dynamic market where we have limited operating experience we plan to invest in seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect or unsuccessful 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

 our sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if our sellers are not our business could be adversely affected in particular buyers and sellers seeking to engage in crossborder sales may become subject to an increasing number of barriers to international trade such as tariffs customs or other taxes 

if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the united states and cannot manage these risks effectively the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets 

legal political and economic uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s recent departure from the european union may be a source of instability in international markets create significant currency fluctuations adversely affect our operations in the united kingdom and pose additional risks to our business revenue financial condition and results of operations 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom formally withdrew from the eu under the terms of its withdrawal the united kingdom will be subject to a transition period until december 31 2020 during which the united kingdom will remain in the single market and customs union the united kingdom and the eu have begun negotiations to determine these relationships following the expiration of the transition period 

lack of clarity about future uk laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu rules and regulations to replace or replicate including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics privacy and information security laws environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws and employment laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom increase costs and depress economic activity in addition depending on the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members the longterm effects of brexit will depend on any agreements or lack thereof between the united kingdom and the eu and in particular any arrangements for the united kingdom to retain access to eu markets going forward 

the united kingdom is one of our core markets we are continuing to monitor brexit developments to enable us to adjust our business and operations as appropriate with the goal of continuing to provide services to our united kingdom and eu buyers and sellers after the transition period ends including in the event of loss of all uk access to eu markets as well as lack of favorable resolution with regard to other eu rules and regulations a failure by the uk and eu to negotiate agreements favorable to the united kingdom by the end of the transition period and ongoing uncertainty with respect to potential divergent 

regulatory standards however could result in additional operational regulatory and compliance costs to us as well as decreased revenue all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business 

in addition to the actual and potential changes in law described elsewhere in these risk factors global developments in privacy and data security regulations are changing some of the ways we and our vendors collect use and share personal information compliance with these changing regulations have necessitated some specific product changes for our nonus activities the gdpr extends the scope of eu data protection law to certain noneu companies processing data of eu persons the gdpr seeks to harmonize the data protection regulations throughout the entire eu the regulation contains numerous requirements and changes from previous eu law including more robust obligations on data processors greater rights for data subjects requiring potentially significant changes to both our technology and operations security and accountability obligations and significantly heavier documentation and recordkeeping requirements for data protection compliance programs specifically the gdpr introduced numerous privacyrelated changes for companies operating in the eu including greater control over personal data by data subjects eg the “right to be forgotten” increased data portability access and redress rights for eu consumers data breach notification requirements increased rules for online and email marketing and stronger regulatory enforcement regimes the gdpr requirements apply to some thirdparty transactions such as commercial contracts with partners and vendors and to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including user and employee information gdpr requirements may also apply depending on interpretation of its reach to some users in our worldwide community of sellers we may experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new eu sellers or new sellers selling into the eu due to the legal requirements compliance cost potential risk exposure and uncertainty for them in respect of their own compliance obligations with respect to gdpr in addition although our sellers are independent businesses it is possible that a privacy authority could deem us jointly and severally liable for actions of our sellers which would increase our potential liability exposure and costs of compliance which could negatively impact our business we could face potential liability regulatory investigation and costly litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance 

in the united states the ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa introduced new requirements regarding the handling of personal information of california consumers and households the law gives individuals the right to request access to and deletion of their information and the right to opt out of sales of their personal information the ccpa also authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about california residents 

gdpr ccpa and similar laws coming into effect in other jurisdictions may continue to change the data protection landscape globally and could result in potentially significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business some of these requirements may introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on our platform and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact our business and future outlook beyond gdpr and ccpa individual jurisdictions continue to pass laws related to data protection such as data privacy and data breach notification resulting in a diverse set of requirements across states countries and regions noncompliance with these laws could result in proceedings against us by one or more data protection authorities other public authorities third parties or individuals under gdpr alone noncompliance could result in fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company whichever is greater 

in addition the laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside of the eu continue to evolve and remain uncertain although we are taking steps to comply and mitigate the potential impact to us the efficacy and longevity of these steps are uncertain we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from the eu in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business in the meantime the evolving data protection landscape also creates uncertainty as to how to comply with eu privacy law including potentially inconsistent guidance rulings or requirements from multiple authorities in the eu as well as in the us and worldwide further we may not be entirely successful in our compliance efforts due to various factors either within our control such as limited internal resource allocation or outside our control such as a lack of vendor cooperation new regulatory interpretations or lack of regulatory guidance in respect of certain gdpr requirements 

we also publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection processing use and disclosure of personal data although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so moreover despite our efforts we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or third party providers fail to comply with our published policies and documentation such failures can subject us to potential international local state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive unfair or misrepresentation of our actual practices 

our payments systems depend on thirdparty providers require ongoing investment and are subject to evolving laws regulations rules and standards 

our buyers primarily pay for purchases using our payments services ie etsy payments and reverb payments or paypal in the united states and other countries where our payments services are available our sellers accept various forms of payments such as credit cards debit cards gift cards paypal google wallet and apple pay 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform underlying compliance credit card processing and payment disbursing currency exchange identity verification sanctions screening and fraud analysis services if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to change or terminate our sellers’ ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and certain financial compliance measures including fraud prevention and detection tools may not be effective which could increase costs lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business in addition we and our thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that negatively impact payments on our platform we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such service outages and if we are unable to provide an alternative payment solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses could increase if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to our sellers some of our sellers may stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether 

various laws and regulations govern payments and these laws are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally moreover even in regions where such laws have been harmonized regulatory interpretations of such laws may differ as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort determining whether various licensing and registration laws relating to payments apply to us and taking steps to comply with applicable laws and licensing regulations any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources could result in liabilities could cause us significant reputational damage or could force us to stop offering our payments services in certain markets additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments systems less profitable for example any significant change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations may negatively impact payments on our platform 

we plan to invest ongoing internal resources into our payments tools and infrastructure in order to maintain existing availability expand into additional markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers if we fail to invest adequate resources into payments on our platform or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable our payments services may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings which could negatively impact their usage and our marketplaces  further our ability to expand our payments services into additional countries is dependent upon the thirdparty providers we use to support these services as we expand the availability of our payments services to additional markets or offer new payment methods to our sellers and buyers in the future we may become subject to additional and evolving regulations compliance requirements and may be exposed to heightened fraud risk which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payment processors we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard which are subject to change failure to comply with these rules and certification requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements including as a result of a change in our designation by major payment card providers could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply and could require a change in our business operations in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules or payment card provider rules could lead to increased fees for us or our sellers which may negatively impact payments on our platform usage of our payments services and our marketplaces 

if we experience a communications or technology disruption or failure that results in a loss of information if personal data or sensitive information about members of our community or employees is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are subject to cyber attacks members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services we are vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personal or financial information of our members or employees as we grow our business expand internationally and gain greater public visibility we may face 

a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we rely on a variety of security measures including security testing encryption of sensitive information and authentication technology we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future security breaches as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional inadvertent or social engineering breaches occurring through our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers in addition if our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers fail to comply with our internal security policies and practices member or employee data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property 

a successful cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected in addition because any investigation of a cybersecurity incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular cybersecurity incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators members of our community and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident 

we are also reliant on the security practices of our third party service providers which may be outside of our direct control additionally some of our third party service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive member data if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or experience a breach of their networks our members’ data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss compromise or unauthorized disclosure of personal data or other sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing sellers and buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face damage to our reputation potential liability regulatory investigations in multiple jurisdictions costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted marketplaces 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses or assets which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful including our acquisition of reverb 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past including our 2019 acquisition of reverb and may acquire additional businesses or technologies or enter into strategic partnerships in the future we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions including the acquisition of reverb or any partnerships and the integration of reverb and possible future acquisitions or relationships may disrupt our business and divert management’s time and attention acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky the reverb acquisition and any future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 



we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

adherence to our guiding principles and our focus on our mission and longterm sustainability may negatively influence our financial performance further our reputation could be harmed if we fail to meet our impact strategy goals 

we intend to operate in line with our guiding principles focus on the longterm sustainability of our business and work toward our mission to “keep commerce human” we may take actions in line with our mission and guiding principles that we believe will benefit our business and therefore our stockholders over a longer period of time even if those actions do not maximize short or mediumterm financial performance however these longerterm benefits may not materialize within the time frame we expect or at all for example 

 

additionally we have developed an impact strategy that focuses on leveraging etsy’s core business to generate value for our community and stakeholders through positive economic social and ecological efforts our impact strategy aims to create more economic opportunity for sellers greater diversity in our workforce and build longterm resilience by reducing our carbon footprint if we don’t demonstrate progress against our impact strategy or if our impact strategy is not perceived to be adequate our reputation could be harmed we could also damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to demonstrate that our commitment to our impact strategy enhances our overall financial performance 

failure to deal effectively with fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business 

we have measures in place to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity in our marketplaces however those measures may not always be effective further the measures that we use to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity must be dynamic as new technologies and ways to commit fraud and other illegal activity are continually evolving and regulations requiring marketplaces to detect and limit these activities are increasing if we fail to limit the impact of fraudulent and other illegal activity in our marketplaces our business reputation financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

for example our sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data under current credit card chargeback rules we could be held liable for orders placed through our payments services with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent transactions we may not be able to do so effectively as a result our business could be adversely affected we could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or payment card association rules or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplaces 

we have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to ensure compliance with anticorruption antimoney laundering export controls and trade sanctions requirements in addition as stated elsewhere in these risk factors we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform certain underlying compliance credit card processing identity verification and fraud analysis services if we or our service providers do not perform adequately certain of our fraud prevention and detection tools may not be effective which could increase our expenses lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business 

negative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent illegal or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for our sellers and buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers and damage our reputation 

we are subject to risks related to our corporate social responsibility metrics 

we voluntarily report certain corporate social responsibility metrics this transparency is consistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the positive economic social and ecological impact we want to have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy these metrics whether it be the standards we set for ourselves andor our failure to meet such metrics may influence our reputation and the value of our brand for example the perception held by our buyers or sellers our partners or vendors other key stakeholders or the communities in which we do business may depend in part on the metrics we have chosen to aspire to and whether or not we meet these metrics on a timely basis if at all while 

selected metrics receive limited assurance from an independent third party this is inherently a less rigorous process than reasonable assurance sought in a typical auditing engagement our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our business financial performance or growth 

by electing to set and share publicly these corporate social responsibility metrics our business may also face increased scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities as a result we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report such as economic security and personal empowerment diversity and inclusion energy and water management carbon footprint and data privacy or if we are perceived not to have rigorously measured our achievement against such metrics any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could impact employee engagement and retention the willingness of our buyers and sellers and our partners and vendors to do business with us or investors’ willingness to purchase or hold shares of our common stock any of which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

operating ecommerce marketplaces is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain sellers and buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses for example in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplaces or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling a seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform such as bigcommerce and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain sellers based on many factors including 

 in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of buyers a buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer including large ecommerce marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba national retail chains such as west elm or target local consignment and vintage stores social commerce channels like instagram eventdriven platforms and vertical experiences like zola and wayfair and other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for our sellers to match 

we compete to attract engage and retain buyers based on many factors including 



 many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do 

they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do additionally we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on our sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to our buyers 

a small portion of buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform for example buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by a seller or that a seller has not been responsive to their questions 

negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers or damage our reputation a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for our sellers and buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse our buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements although we are focused on enhancing customer service our efforts may be unsuccessful and our sellers and buyers may be disappointed in their experience and not return 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to our buyers could harm our sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of our sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of our sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of our buyers which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our mission and guiding principles makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by our sellers or other members of our community our policies promote legal and ethical business practices such as encouraging etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions however we do not control our sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform 

the reliability of our platform is important to our ability to generate and grow revenue reputation and our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers as the number of sellers and buyers volume of traffic number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow the operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex and we could experience operational failures if we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability the investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our business and to improve our operating results in the long term but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce profitability in the near term upgrading our platform software and networks may also subject us to disruptions failures or delays 

we also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet cloud and mobile infrastructure and increasingly rely on the availability features cost and reliability of thirdparty service providers and platforms for example this includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products 

thirdparty providers host much of our technology infrastructure and are likely to host more in the future any disruption in their services or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplaces could significantly harm our business for example any significant disruption of or interference with our use of cloud infrastructure would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide such as security concerns our efforts to update our infrastructure may not be successful or may take longer than anticipated if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully then our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers could be adversely affected which could harm our growth prospects and our business 

we rely on google cloud for a substantial portion of the computing storage data processing networking and other services for etsycom 

google cloud platform provides a distributed computing infrastructure as a service platform for business operations and we have migrated etsy’s data centers to google cloud increasing our reliance on cloud infrastructure any transition of the cloud services currently provided by google cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense any significant disruption of or interference with our use of google cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed in addition if hosting costs increase over time and if we require more computing or storage capacity our costs could increase disproportionately if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of google or similar providers our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit infringing or illegal 

we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplaces infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplaces along with anticounterfeiting measures our platform employs and continues to develop we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplaces and in certain cases closing the shops of sellers who violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability for example on the etsy marketplace we use a combination of automatic and manual tools and depend upon human review in many circumstances our tools and procedures may be subject to error or enforcement failures and may not be adequately staffed and we may be subject to erroneous or fraudulent demands to remove content in addition we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where laws may offer less protection for intermediaries and platforms than the united states under current us copyright law and the communications decency act we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on our platform by sellers and buyers however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions these safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably in that event we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of our sellers 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platforms less userfriendly these claims or legal and regulatory changes could require the removal of noninfringing or completely unrelated content which could negatively impact our business and our ability to retain sellers moreover public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplaces even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

our business and our sellers and buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial tax goods and services tax business tax withholding tax digital service tax and gross receipt tax to businesses like ours and to our sellers and buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear when and how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to our sellers’ businesses if we are found to be deficient in how we have addressed our tax obligations our business could be adversely impacted 

various jurisdictions including the us states and european union member states are seeking to or have recently imposed additional reporting recordkeeping or indirect tax collection and remittance obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce if requirements like these become applicable in additional jurisdictions our business collectively with etsy sellers’ businesses could be harmed for example taxing authorities in many us states and in other countries have identified ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and have enacted laws and others are considering related legislation additionally the supreme court’s recent decision in south dakota v wayfair inc et al overturned existing law that sellers are not required to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer’s state as a result of the wayfair decision us states have begun to adopt and enforce laws requiring us or our sellers to calculate collect and remit taxes on their sales such changes to current law or new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on our marketplaces causes our marketplaces to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers which could materially impact our business financial performance and growth additionally this legislation could require us or our sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling in our marketplaces less attractive if we are found to be deficient in the calculation collection and remittance of taxes in the jurisdictions in which we do business our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and laws and regulations focused on ecommerce and online marketplaces such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability intellectual property and consumer protection in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws in some cases nonus privacy data security consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more detailed than those in the united states and in some countries are actively enforced 

these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to online marketplaces as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by online marketplaces or ecommerce for example as described elsewhere in these risk factors laws relating to privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements that are applicable to etsy 

new platform liability laws potential amendments to existing laws and ongoing regulatory and judicial interpretation of these laws imparting liability for conduct by users of a platform may create costs and uncertainty for both etsy and sellers on our platform for example the european union recently passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement which member states are expected to implement by 2021 in addition there have been various congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency 

act and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages 

some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain our sellers and buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business could be adversely affected 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments or the inconsistent enforcement of such laws and regulations could impede the growth of ecommerce or online marketplaces which could have a negative impact on our business and operations examples include data localization requirements limitation on marketplace scope or ownership intellectual property intermediary liability rules regulation of online speech limits on network neutrality and rules related to security privacy or national security which may impede us or our users we could also face regulatory challenges or be subject to discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business furthermore the circumstances in which we may be held liable for the acts omissions or responsibilities of our sellers is uncertain complex and evolving for example certain laws have recently been enacted seeking to hold marketplaces like ours responsible for certain compliance obligations for which sellers have traditionally been responsible if an increasing number of such laws are passed the resulting compliance costs and potential liability risk could negatively impact our business 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform which can impact the user experience on our marketplaces additionally due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platform updates to certain parts of our code including changes to our or third party apis on which we rely could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platform that negatively impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplaces any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks 

our sellers and buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplaces internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in addition we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and our sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business in 2015 rules approved by the federal communications commission “fcc” went into effect that prohibited internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain “fast traffic” lanes however those rules were repealed in june 2018 and efforts to challenge the repeal in the courts have failed to reverse the fcc’s 2018 decision and in october 2019 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit provided a mixed ruling that did not reverse the fcc’s 2015 decision in its entirety although this recent court ruling allows states to enact their own net neutrality rules the repeal of federal protections may make it more difficult or costly for many small businesses such as our community of sellers as well as our buyers to access our platform and may result in 

increased costs for us which could significantly harm our business and the millions of microbusinesses that utilize our platform 

outside of the united states it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

the actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business specifically responding to common actions of an activist stockholder such as requests for special meetings potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming or divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company which may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees our ability to continue to commit to our mission guiding principles and culture may also be questioned which could impact our ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which are extremely costly to defend could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims third parties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings third parties may also allege a company is secondarily liable for intellectual property infringement or that it is a joint infringer with another party including claims that etsy is liable either directly indirectly or vicariously for infringement claims against sellers or third parties and that statutory judicial or other immunities and defenses do not protect us any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters in addition some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors patent holding companies and other intellectual property rights holders have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their perceived intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where we do business we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property patent filings may not be adequate alone to protect our intellectual property and we rely on trade secret protection for parts of our technology and intellectual property to the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation or licensing to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world particularly as to technologies used in ecommerce and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software 

the software powering our platform incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by us and the internet and technology industries have been interpreted by only a few court decisions and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplaces under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform and availability of patches or fixes may not be consistent or quickly available as it may be subject to the continued community engagement in a particular open source project additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the united states and in numerous other foreign jurisdictions we record tax expense including indirect taxes based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable or likely settlements of tax audits we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including tax collection obligations due to changes in tax law such as legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 including regulations administrative practices outcomes of court cases and changes to the global tax framework further our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by results of our business operations including changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions acquisitions investments entry into new geographies the relative amount of foreign earnings changes in foreign currency exchanges rates changes in our stock price intercompany transactions changes to accounting rules expectation of future profits changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our assessment of their realizability and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in the ordinary course of our business there are numerous transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our tax positions and related provisions reflected in the financial statements are fully supportable we recognize that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations to the extent that the ultimate results differ our original or adjusted estimates our effective tax rate can be adversely affected 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions 

timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the company operates a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against the company if the ultimate result of these audits differs from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact our effective tax rate and tax liabilities 

at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we could be subject to higher than anticipated tax liabilities as well as ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as audits close and exposures are reevaluated 

we may be involved in litigation and regulatory matters that are expensive and time consuming 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including class action or shareholder derivative lawsuits we may become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny inquiries or investigations including with respect to our community relating to broad industrywide concerns such as antitrust and privacy that could lead to increased expenses or reputational damage 

under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters any lawsuit to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

actions brought against us may result in lawsuits enforcement actions injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business although we establish accruals for our litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable there may be a material exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued or in excess of any loss contingencies disclosed as reasonably possible such loss contingencies may not be probable and reasonably estimable until the proceedings have progressed significantly which could take several years and occur close to resolution of the matter 

if our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business 

our insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities such as general liability property coverage errors and omissions liability employment liability business interruptions data breaches crime product liability and directors’ and officers’ liability for certain types of business risk we may not be able to or may choose not to acquire insurance in addition our insurance may not adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums andor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain additionally if any of our insurers becomes insolvent it would be unable to pay any claims that we make 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future we are currently integrating reverb into our operations and financial internal control processes and pursuant to the sec’s guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting at december 31 2019 will not include reverb we cannot assure you that reverb will be effectively integrated into our operational or financial internal control processes or that that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness relating to reverb in our internal control processes in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we have difficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at businesses that we acquire or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud and individuals including employees and contractors could circumvent such controls because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt in the future we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt when due 

  

our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness including the 0 convertible senior notes due 2023 we issued in march 2018 and the 0125 convertible senior notes due 2026 we issued in september 2019 together the “notes” depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures in addition any required repurchase of the notes for cash as a result of a fundamental change would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for us in our business if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations 

  

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt if for example we incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt these actions may diminish our ability to make payments on our substantial debt when due 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

under accounting standards codification 47020 —debt with conversion and other options  “asc 47020” an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the equity components of the notes are required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we will be required to record noncash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we will report lower net income in our financial results because asc 47020 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount under the treasury stock method for diluted earnings per share purposes the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in shares are issued we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility however our credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders any debt financing that we may secure in the future could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all weakness and volatility in capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for example since january 1 2019 our common stock’s daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 4051 to a high of 7277 through february 21 2020  the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 



 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial performance or growth stock prices of many internet and technology companies have historically been highly volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation we have experienced securities class action lawsuits in the past and may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

our stock repurchases are discretionary and even if effected they may not achieve the desired objectives 

in november 2018 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 200 million of our common stock there can be no assurance that these stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares in addition there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases in the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of recent and future employee stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock if our financial condition deteriorates or we decide to use our cash for other purposes we may suspend repurchase activity 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility as a result stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future including as a result of conversion of the outstanding notes we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

 these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company by imposing certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

overview 

business 

etsy operates twosided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers our mission is to “keep commerce human” and we’re committed to using the power of business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people around the world 

our primary marketplace etsycom is the global destination for unique and creative goods the etsy marketplaceconnects creative entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are intended to be special reflect their sense of style or represent a meaningful occasionour sellers are the heart and soul of etsy and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity we have a selleraligned business model we make money when our sellers make money we offer etsy sellers a marketplace with millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses 

we are focused on attracting potential buyers to the etsy marketplace for those “special” purchaseoccasions that happen throughout the year and for everyday items that have meaning we are deepening engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases across our many retail categories and special occasions special purchases for use in the every day include handmade or vintage unique clothing accessories household items or furniture that the buyer wants to reflect her sense of style special purchase occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include shopping for special occasions that reflects an individual’s unique style gifting that demonstrates thought and care and celebrations that express creativity and fun buyers tell us that they come to etsy because etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else 

on august 15 2019  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of reverb holdings inc “reverb” for 2704 million  net of cash acquired the reverb marketplace is a leading global online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling new used and vintage musical instruments with a vibrant community of buyers and sellers all over the world reverb now a whollyowned subsidiary of etsy inc is included in all financial and other metrics from august 15 2019 the date of acquisition unless otherwise noted 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses 

marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for marketplace activities marketplace activities include listing an item for sale completing transactions between a buyer and a seller and using our payments services to process payments including foreign currency transactions marketplace revenue also includes revenue generated through our commercial partnerships which was recorded in its own other revenue line prior to the fourth quarter of 2019 

services revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for our optional other services “services” services primarily include advertising services which allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results and shipping labels which allows sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia to purchase discounted shipping labels 

our strategy is focused on growing the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies and building a sustainable competitive advantage around four elements of our business that we believe differentiate us from our competitors or what we call our “right to win” the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of our seller’s unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on these four elements of our business ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to drive 

more new buyers to the website give existing buyers reasons to come back more often encourage buyers to spend more per order and fuel success for our sellers we see a number of similarities between the levers of growth for the etsy and reverb marketplaces including improving search and discovery making selling and buying easier and building a global brand and user community 

year highlights 

total revenue was 8184 million in the year ended december 31 2019  driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue in the year ended december 31 2019  we recorded net income of 959 million  and nongaap adjusted ebitda of 1863 million  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

as of december 31 2019  our marketplaces connected 27 million active sellers and 464 million active buyers in nearly every country in the world in the year ended december 31 2019  sellers generated gms of 50 billion of which approximately 58 came from purchases made on mobile devices we are a global company and approximately 36 of our gms in the year ended december 31 2019 came from transactions where either a seller or a buyer was located outside of the united states 

other operational highlights 

in 2019 we focused on growing the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies and owning special purchase occasions – style gifting and celebrations – throughout the year below are key operational highlights 



implementation costs and costs related to cloud usage for growth initiatives and completed the migration in february 2020 

while our etsy ads platform delivered positive returns for many etsy sellers and revenue growth for etsy in the fourth quarter of 2019 we will be iterating on our advertising offerings to help sellers more effectively drive traffic to their listings in the second quarter of 2020 etsy is planning to launch a new advertising service for etsy sellers called offsite ads etsy will pay the upfront costs to promote etsy sellers’ listings on multiple internet platforms without any upfront costs for sellers when a shopper clicks on an online offsite ad featuring a seller’s listing and purchases from their shop the seller will pay etsy an advertising fee on that order  only when they make a sale the etsy ads service will be a dedicated onsite advertising program for sellers to promote their listings to shoppers on etsy 

debt 

in september 2019  we issued 6500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the securities act the initial conversion price of the 2019 notes represented a premium of approximately 475 over the price of our common stock the net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 notes were 6395 million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses the 2019 notes will mature on october 1 2026  unless earlier converted redeemed or repurchased 

we used 762 million of the net proceeds from the 2019 notes offering to enter into separate capped call transactions “2019 capped call transactions” with certain financial institutions the 2019 capped call transactions effectively increase the premium for conversion of the 2019 notes at maturity to 100 and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2019 notes and offset any payments we make upon conversion 

in addition we used 1245 million of the net proceeds from the 2019 notes to repurchase 2094196 shares of our common stock we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2019 notes offering for general corporate purposes 

on february 25 2019  we entered into a 2000 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with several lenders the “ 2019 credit agreement ” the 2019 credit agreement will mature in february 2024  the 2019 credit agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of 300 million and a swingline loan sublimit of 100 million

key operating and financial metrics 

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health and performance of our business and allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments the financial results of reverb have been included in our consolidated financial results from august 15 2019 the date of acquisition we are providing etsycom standalone information in certain instances where particularly relevant the unaudited nongaap financial measure and key operating and financial metrics we use are 



 gms 

gross merchandise sales “gms” is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplaces within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by us gms is largely driven by transactions in our marketplaces and is not directly impacted by services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of our sellers the satisfaction of our buyers and the health scale and growth of our business we track “paid gms” for the etsy marketplace and define it as etsycom gms that is attributable to our performance marketing efforts which excludes most of our marketing investments focused on brand awareness like tv and digital video 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net income loss adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net  benefit provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  foreign exchange gain loss  acquisitionrelated expenses  nonordinary course disputes  restructuring and other exit costs income  asset impairment charges  net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities  and contributions to good work institute formerly etsyorg  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda including its limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is a seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include marketplace and services revenue fees discussed in “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies —revenue recognition” in the notes to consolidated financial statements a seller is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple seller accounts and can count as a distinct active seller in each of our marketplaces we succeed when sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our business 

active buyers 

an active buyer is a buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months a buyer is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique email address a single person can have multiple buyer accounts and can count as a distinct active buyer in each of our marketplaces we generate revenue when buyers order items from sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of buyers and the health of our business 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop when calculating the percentage of mobile gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the seller or the shipping address for the buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states when calculating percent international gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

currencyneutral gms growth 

we calculate currencyneutral gms growth by translating current period gms for goods sold that were listed in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates 

as reported and currencyneutral gms growth for the periods presented below is as follows and include the operations of reverb since august 15 2019 the date of acquisition 



nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda 

in this annual report on form 10k we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net  benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  foreign exchange gain loss  acquisitionrelated expenses  nonordinary course disputes  restructuring and other exit costs income  and asset impairment charges  below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform 

we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges 

adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated

key factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed in the section titled “ risk factors ” our primary marketplace etsycom is the largest driver of our business and thus the following key factors affecting our performance most significantly relate to the etsy marketplace 

growth and retention of active buyers and active sellers on the etsy marketplace 

our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active buyers and active sellers our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers buyer engagement active sellers seller engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace we believe two of our most significant opportunities to drive growth in our primary marketplace are to bring new buyers to etsycom and encourage existing etsy buyers to purchase more frequently we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers or buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more purchase days in the year we are also focused on keeping our best sellers on the platform and helping them grow their businesses by enhancing the seller tools and services that help drive buyer demand 

during 2019  the etsy marketplace had 19 million new etsy buyers or buyers who made their firstever purchase on etsy gms from new buyers was up   11 yearoveryear and represented approximately 16 of overall etsycom gms a decrease compared to last year etsycom gms from existing buyers grew   24 yearoveryear in 2019 and represented approximately 84 of overall etsycom gms an increase compared to last year repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2019  on the etsy marketplace approximately 414 of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months up from 401 in 2018  

habitual buyers represented approximately 55 of etsycom’s active buyers as of december 31 2019  habitual buyers grew to 25 million as of december 31 2019  an increase of 229 compared to 2018  we aim to increase repeat purchases and habitual buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions building trust in the etsy brand and removing friction from the buying experience to improve conversion rates 

to analyze our retention rates on the etsy marketplace we measure repeat activity by active buyers and active sellers 

 

active buyer cohorts on the etsy marketplace 

we refer to active buyers as of december 31 2016 as “2016 active buyers” as of december 31 2015 as “2015 active buyers” as of december 31 2014 as “2014 active buyers” as of december 31 2013 as “2013 active buyers” and as of december 31 2012 as “2012 active buyers” of total 2016 active buyers 379 remained active buyers through their fourth year on the platform compared to 375 for 2015 active buyers 387 for 2014 active buyers 411 for 2013 active buyers and 425 for 2012 active buyers the average annual gms per 2016 active buyer during their fourth year on the platform was 85 higher than their first year compared to 78 for 2015 active buyers 70 for 2014 active buyers 81 for 2013 active buyers and 88 for 2012 active buyers we note that 2013 was the first year we started to significantly invest in our paid acquisition marketing efforts to grow our buyer base 





these cohort data demonstrate our ability to consistently retain buyers over a multiyear period and reflects the loyalty of our buyer base we have identified our ability to increase purchase frequency among these longterm and habitual buyers as one of our significant opportunities for growth and we are focused on improving search and recommendations to better match our buyers with the millions of items listed on etsycom driving buyer growth and retention 

active seller cohorts on the etsy marketplace 

we refer to active sellers as of december 31 2016 as “2016 active sellers” as of december 31 2015 as “2015 active sellers” as of december 31 2014 as “2014 active sellers” as of december 31 2013 as “2013 active sellers” and december 31 2012 as “2012 active sellers” of the 2016 active sellers 362 remained active through their fourth year on the platform compared to 331 for 2015 active sellers 318 for 2014 active sellers 315 for 2013 active sellers and 323 for 2012 active sellers the average annual gms per 2016 active seller during their fourth year on the platform was three times higher than their first year compared to over three times higher for 2015 active sellers also over three times higher for 2014 active sellers almost four times higher for 2013 active sellers and over four times higher for 2012 active sellers 





these cohort data demonstrate our success in retaining sellers over a multiyear period with the sellers that remain on our platform maintaining consistent gms growth we believe there is significant opportunity for growth by fueling seller success through continued investment in paid services and tools to help etsy sellers generate more sales on our platform 

services growth 

we have a selleraligned business model we make money when sellers make money our goal is to enhance the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand to achieve this we continue to invest our resources in developing a cohesive platform of paid services and free tools specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses we believe we can grow our optional paid services in three ways expand the utility of existing services expand the geographic reach of existing services and launch new services offerings as of december 31 2019  on the etsy marketplace 166 of active sellers used advertising services and 229 of active sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia used etsy shipping labels 

investment in marketing 

we are focusing on initiatives to drive traffic to etsy and shape perceptions of the etsy marketplace as the goto shopping destination for special purchases and special purchase occasions by investing primarily in digital and other marketing initiatives such as search engine optimization and television channels and in our team to support marketing activities we believe that we can continue to grow our acquisition marketing efforts both in scaling and improving our current efforts and by expanding into new marketing channels in 2019  paid gms was 15 of total etsycom gms and grew 7 compared to 2018  paid gms only reflects etsycom gms related to performance marketing spend and excludes brand marketing channels such as tv in 2018 we ran our firstever etsy television advertising campaign in the united states and also began to test offline marketing campaigns we continued these marketing campaigns during 2019 we believe these campaigns can increase brand awareness visits and purchase intent 

in 2019  we spent 2156 million on marketing expenses or 263 of revenue up 364 over 2018  in 2018  we spent 1580 million on marketing expenses or 262 of revenue up 449 over 2017  we increased digital marketing spend which excludes brand marketing channels such as tv by 19 in 2019 to 1340 million including 1293 million of which was spend for the etsy marketplace up 15 from 2018 

investment in technology 

our engineering team has built a platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we have made and will continue to make significant investments in our platform to attract buyers and sellers to the etsy marketplace and enhance their experience 

in september 2016 we acquired blackbird technologies inc “blackbird” a machine learning company and during 2017 fully integrated it into our search team during 2017  we launched context specific ranking “csr” which leverages our internal data to create a more personalized search experience on the etsy marketplace we continued to improve the search experience using csr throughout 2018 and migrated to nonlinear search models in 2019 we completed our migration to google cloud in february 2020 and our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform we expect to continue to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable shoppers to more easily browse filter and transact on the etsy marketplace even when they may not have something specific in mind 

in 2019  we spent 1219 million on product development expenses or 149 of revenue up 253 over 2018  and in 2018 we spent 972 million on product development expenses or 161 of revenue up 303 over 2017  in addition we capitalized website development and internaluse software costs of 87 million and 221 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively on a consolidated basis additionally in 2019 we acquired developed technology valued at 303 million in the reverb acquisition we plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our community and increase our efforts to recruit and hire employees to work on our engineering teams 

investment in connected experience—mobile and desktop 

we want to engage buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience no matter what device they use to access our marketplaces mobile is integrated into everything that we do and expanding our mobile capabilities is an important focus area our mobile websites and mobile apps include search discovery curation personalization and social shopping features optimized for a personal mobile experience etsycom mobile gms was 59 of total etsycom gms in 2019 up from 55 in 2018 we are focused on increasing conversion rates in general however we are particularly focused on mobile web which continued to be the largest driver of overall visits growth if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains we are focused on continuing to enhance the buyer experience through mobile offering improvements in 2020 

international growth 

our growth will depend in part on international sellers and international buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community our vision is global and local our websites are available in many languages and supports buyers and sellers in nearly every country in the world in 2018 we entered into a referral agreement with dawanda gmbh “dawanda” a privately held germanybased marketplace for gifts and handmade items as part of this agreement dawanda agreed to encourage its community of buyers and sellers to migrate to the etsy platform the referral agreement with dawanda allowed us to grow our international business by expanding our footprint in central europe particularly in germany one of our core geographic markets 

on a consolidated basis international gms was 36 of total gms in 2019 compared to 35 in 2018  

for the etsy marketplace we expect international gms to continue to grow faster than us gms in 2020  assuming that currency rates remain stable compared to average levels in december 2019  driven by our efforts to build local communities and foster local connections in 2019  40 of etsy sellers were located outside the united states crossborder transactions is the largest component of international gms and we remain committed to reducing barriers such as language and currency so that sellers and buyers from different countries can easily connect and transact for the etsy marketplace gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country grew approximately 37 in 2019 compared with 2018  making it the fastest growing category of international gms the reverb marketplace has a smaller percent of international gms relative to the etsy marketplace 

we are focused on building local marketplaces globally and deepening local communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of sellers and buyers to execute on our international strategy we plan to continue to invest in local marketing and other locallyrelevant tools and enhancements such as local search boost to encourage these connections around the world 

our company culture 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate exceptional employees who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we believe that our actionoriented valuesbased and purposedriven work culture is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent 

we are focused on employee engagement which is linked with high performance retention innovation and growth we are also committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace because we firmly believe that diverse backgrounds thoughts and experiences are beneficial to innovation decision making and our business as a whole we are proud that as of december 31 2019  our board of directors and leadership were at least 50 female

 reverbcom services revenue reverb has its own onsite advertising service called bump advertising reverb sellers have the ability to determine their own ad rate as a percentage of their item’s final sale price reverb also provides its sellers access to purchase shipping labels at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through its platform revenue from shipping labels consists of fees a reverb seller pays us when they purchase shipping labels directly through the reverb platform net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels 

our revenue recognition policies are discussed under “ critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates ” 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support payments revenue and costs of refunds made to buyers that we are not able to collect from sellers cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with the usage of cloud infrastructure including employeerelated costs hosting and bandwidth costs and depreciation and amortization with the shift to etsy ads in the third quarter of 2019 amounts spent on google shopping which were previously recorded on a net basis in other revenue are recorded on a gross basis in services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes for example to the extent that payments revenue increases as a percentage of revenue there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin as our payments services are lower margin products compared to our other offerings 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of marketing product development general and administrative expenses and asset impairment charges direct and indirect employeerelated expenses are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories we include stockbased compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function we include restructuring and other exit costs income related to the actions in the applicable operating expense category of the impacted function 

marketing marketing expenses largely consist of direct marketing and indirect employeerelated expenses to support our marketing initiatives direct marketing includes digital marketing brand marketing television and video public relations and communications market research marketing partnerships and customer relationship management digital marketing also referred to as performance marketing primarily consists of targeted promotional campaigns through electronic channels such as product listing ads search engine marketing affiliate programs display advertising and social channels which are focused on buyer acquisition and retargeting

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses for our general corporate functions general and administrative expenses also include costs associated with the use of facilities and equipment including depreciation and amortization and office overhead and certain professional services expenses 

asset impairment charges asset impairment charges consist primarily of noncash charges related to our decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and the impairment of the related capitalized web development and internaluse software costs 

other expense income net 

other expense income net consists of interest expense interest and other income and foreign exchange gain loss  interest expense consists primarily of noncash interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes due 2023 and 2026 as part of the adoption of asu 201602—leases in the first quarter of 2019 interest expense includes interest associated with our brooklyn headquarters lease and to a lesser extent interest on our hosting and computer equipment leases both accounted for as finance leases prior to 2019 interest expense included interest associated with the buildtosuit accounting treatment of our brooklyn headquarters lease and to a lesser extent interest on our hosting and computer equipment leases accounted for as capital lease obligations interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest and dividend income from our investment accounts 

benefit for income taxes 

our effective tax rate and the benefit for income taxes is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pretax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate taxable income and loss in each jurisdiction changes in our stock price auditrelated developments acquisitions changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the magnitude of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower 

although management believes its tax positions and related provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are fully supportable it recognizes that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities these tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available including progress on tax audits changes in interpretation of tax laws developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations to the extent that the results differ from our original or adjusted estimates of the company the effect will be recorded in provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision benefit for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision and results of operations

marketplace revenue increased  1489 million  or 335  to  5936 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  this growth corresponded with a 265   increase in gms to a total of 50 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  marketplace revenue increased at a faster rate than gms primarily due to the increase in transaction revenue and payments revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  transaction revenue increased   489 yearoveryear primarily driven by our 2018 pricing updates which drove approximately 30 of the 489   increase  payments revenue increased   257  largely driven by overall gms growth trends the share of etsycom gms processed through our etsy payments platform was 89 for the year ended december 31 2019  up from 86 for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to the transition of sellers in eligible countries to the platform listing fee revenue grew   166  driven by an increase in charged listings yearoveryear corresponding with the increase in overall gms growth marketplace revenue also increased due to the acquisition of reverb 

services revenue increased  658 million  or 414  to  2247 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the growth in services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in advertising revenue formerly referred to as promoted listings and google shopping up   513  we launched our new unified ad platform etsy ads in the third quarter of 2019 which combines promoted listings etsycom’s onsite ads platform and google shopping an offsite marketing tool for etsycom sellers with the shift to etsy ads amounts spent on google shopping which were previously recorded on a net basis in other revenue are recorded on a gross basis in services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue the increase in advertising revenue was due to higher click volume and revenue from google shopping at december 31 2019  166 of etsy active sellers used etsy advertising services 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue increased 803 million  or 421  to  2710 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  primarily driven by increased costs related to processing etsy payments corresponding to the increase in etsy payments revenue and increased costs related to the google shopping portion of the new etsy ads platform with the shift to etsy ads google shopping expense is recorded in cost of revenue but was previously recorded on a net basis in other revenue the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by increased cloudrelated hosting and bandwidth costs the cost of revenue associated with the reverb business which includes amortization expense for developed technology and to a lesser extent employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation primarily driven by increases in average salary and headcount we spent approximately 30 million on cloud migration in 2019 which includes implementation costs and costs related to cloud usage for growth initiatives and completed the migration in february 2020 starting in the second quarter of 2020 etsy will no longer recognize costs related to the google shopping portion of the original etsy ads platform in cost of revenue but will instead recognize the costs related to offsite ads in marketing expense 

operating expenses 

there were a total of 1240 employees on december 31 2019  of which 184 were reverb employees compared with 874 on december 31 2018  

marketing 



marketing expenses increased 576 million  or 364  to  2156 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily a result of increased spend related to buyer acquisition including the launch of our holiday television ad campaign and the acquisition of reverb paid gms was 15 of overall etsycom gms in the year ended december 31 2019  down from paid gms of 17 in the year ended december 31 2018  which we believe is a result of our television ad campaigns driving more organic traffic in 2020 we expect to increase our investment in marketing including into channels such as television beginning in the second quarter of 2020 marketing expense will include costs related to our new offsite ads product 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased 246 million  or 253  to  1219 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  primarily as a result of an increase in employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly the result of an increase in average headcount this increase was also driven to a lesser extent by a decrease in the amount of employeerelated costs capitalized as a result of several larger project launches in 2018 mainly related to cloud migration

general and administrative expenses increased 383 million  or 462  to  1211 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to increased amortization expense related to the change in accounting treatment for our brooklyn headquarters lease associated with the adoption of asu 201602 —leases in the first quarter of 2019 the increase in general and administrative expenses is also driven by increased bad debt expense primarily related to countries not covered by etsy payments additionally there were increases in professional services as well as employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation which were mainly the result of an increase in average headcount 

other expense net 

  



other expense net was  81 million in the year ended december 31 2019  which decreased 116 million from 197 million in the year ended december 31 2018  the decrease in expense was primarily driven by the decrease in nonfunctional currency intercompany balances and the change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on our intercompany and other nonfunctional currency balances increased interest and dividend income related to our investment accounts and decreased interest expense related to the change in accounting treatment for our brooklyn headquarters lease associated with the adoption of asu 

201602 —leases in the first quarter of 2019 this was partially offset by noncash interest related to our convertible debt issued in the third quarter of 2019 

benefit for income taxes 

  



our income tax benefit for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 152 million and 224 million  respectively 

the primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2019 were excess tax benefits from employee stockbased compensation of 163 million  and a benefit related to research and development tax credit of 99 million  partially offset by tax expense on pretax book income of 115 million  

the primary driver of our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2018 were tax benefit related to valuation allowance of 287 million stockbased compensation of 117 million and our research and development tax credit of 41 million these were partially offset by tax expense related to income before income taxes of 113 million state and local tax expense of 38 million and the inclusion of additional taxes of 39 million due to certain tax provision introduced by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as enacted by the us federal government on december 22 2017 the “tcja” 

for both periods other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates 

comparison of years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 

revenue 

  



gms increased 6781 million  or 208  to 39 billion in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  on a currencyneutral basis excluding the direct impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth for the year ended december 31 2018 would have been 204  or approximately 40 basis points lower than the reported 208 growth supporting this growth in gms active sellers increased 94 to 21 million and active buyers increased 182 to 394 million at december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017  in the year ended december 31 2018  gms from new buyers increased 16 yearoveryear and represented approximately 18 of overall gms a decrease compared to last year in the year ended december 31 2018  gms from existing buyers increased 23 yearoveryear and represented approximately 82 of overall gms an increase compared to last year 

during the year ended december 31 2018  mobile gms increased as a percentage of total gms to approximately 55  up from approximately 51 for the year ended december 31 2017  we believe this increase was a result of increased mobile traffic and to a lesser extent continued improvements in our mobile offerings for etsy buyers mobile gms growth during the year ended december 31 2018 was approximately 30  with mobile web and mobile app gms each continuing to grow faster than desktop gms during the year 

for the year ended december 31 2018  international gms increased as a percentage of total gms to 35  up from approximately 33 for the year ended december 31 2017  international gms was up approximately 28 in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  driven by gms between us buyers and international sellers and by our fastest growing international trade route international domestic which is gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country international domestic gms grew approximately 36 in 2018 compared with 2017  on a currencyneutral basis international gms growth for the year ended december 31 2018 would have been 27  

revenue increased 1625 million  or 368  to 6037 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  of which 737 consisted of marketplace revenue and 263 consisted of services revenue 

marketplace revenue increased 1154 million  or 350  to 4448 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  this growth corresponded with a 208 increase in gms to a total of 39 billion in the year ended december 31 2018  marketplace revenue increased at a faster rate than gms primarily due to the increase in transaction revenue and etsy payments revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  transaction revenue increased 596 yearoveryear primarily driven by our 2018 pricing updates which drove approximately 41 of the 596 increase  etsy payments revenue increased 244  largely driven by overall gms growth trends and increased seller adoption the share of gms processed through our etsy payments platform was 86  for the year ended december 31 2018  up from 85 in the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to the transition of sellers in eligible countries to the platform during the second quarter of 2018 we reached the anniversary of the etsy payments adoption requirement which has been a substantial driver of yearoveryear etsy payments revenue growth and therefore we expect etsy payments to grow more closely inline with yearoveryear gms growth in future quarters listing fee revenue grew 170  driven by an increase in charged listings yearoveryear corresponding with the increase in overall gms growth listing fee revenue increased at a slower rate than gms primarily due to the issuance of free listings in our international markets including france and germany 

services revenue increased 471 million  or 421  to 1589 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the growth in services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in promoted listings up 414  and to a lesser extent etsy shipping labels up 399  the increase in promoted listings revenue was due to higher click volume and overall product enhancements including expansion of promoted listing budgets and context specific ranking on promoted listings which increased the relevance of promoted ads in our search results the increase in etsy shipping label revenue was primarily driven by a combination of an increase in label volume and an increase in average margin per label additionally etsy shipping label revenue reflects a onetime adjustment to recognize prior period revenue which drove 28 million of the increase  at december 31 2018  151 of active sellers used promoted listings and 247 of active sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia used etsy shipping labels 

cost of revenue 

  



cost of revenue increased 398 million  or 263  to 1908 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily driven by additional costs as a result of the increase in transactions and related revenue generated on the etsy platform the remaining increase was driven by hosting and bandwidth costs incurred as a result of our migration to the cloud while also maintaining our current infrastructure and to a lesser extent increases in employeerelated and professional services expenses cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue largely due to 2018 changes in our pricing 

operating expenses 

there were a total of 874 employees on december 31 2018  compared with 744 on december 31 2017  

marketing 

  



marketing expenses increased 489 million  or 449  to 1580 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of increased spend on digital marketing related to buyer acquisition and to a lesser extent increased direct marketing expenses associated with our television ad campaigns these increases were offset by decreases in employeerelated expenses due to a reduction in average headcount and 30 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions included in marketing expense for the year ended december 31 2017 that did not recur in 2018 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased 226 million  or 303  to 972 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation and professional services expenses for consultants working on our product and engineering teams the increase in employeerelated expenses includes approximately 85 million of expense in connection with certain employee departures including 70 million in expense resulting from the modification of stock options and rsus additionally 32 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions is included in product development expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  

general and administrative 

  



general and administrative expenses decreased 86 million  or 94  to 829 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to decreased employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly the result of a reduction in average headcount and 70 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 that did not recur in 2018 

asset impairment charges 

  



there were no asset impairment charges in the year ended december 31 2018  asset impairment charges were 32 million in the year ended december 31 2017  in the fourth quarter of 2017 we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings including etsy studio and etsy manufacturing which resulted in the recognition of a 32 million impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internaluse software assets down to zero this decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the etsycom marketplace 

other expense income net 

  



other expense net was 197 million in the year ended december 31 2018  which increased 401 million from other income net of 204 million in the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in expense was primarily driven by the change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on our intercompany and other nonfunctional currency balances and higher interest expense mainly noncash interest related to our convertible debt issued in the first quarter of 2018 partially offset by increased interest and dividend income related to our investment accounts interest expense also includes noncash interest expense associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting related to our corporate headquarters which remained flat yearoveryear 

benefit for income taxes 

  



our income tax benefit for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 was 224 million and 495 million  respectively 

the primary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2018 were tax benefit related to valuation allowance of 287 million  stockbased compensation of 117 million  and our research and development tax credit of 41 million  these were partially offset by tax expense related to income before income taxes of 113 million  state and local tax expense of 38 million  and the inclusion of additional taxes of 39 million due to certain provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as enacted by the us federal government on december 22 2017 the “tcja” 

the primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 was the impact on deferred taxes from the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 as a result of the tcja which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 our deferred taxes and certain unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 have been revalued at the reduced 21 rate the revaluation resulted in a benefit for income taxes of approximately 311 million for the year ended december 31 2017  

the secondary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 was the recognition of excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 —stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this updated guidance we recorded 128 million of excess tax benefits rather than additional paidin capital for the year ended december 31 2017  

for both periods other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

quarterly results of operations 

the following tables show selected unaudited quarterly results of operations and other unaudited operational and nongaap financial data for the eight quarters ended december 31 2019 and the percentage that each line item in the following results of operations data represents of revenue the results of operations data for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and includes all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of our results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our quarterly results of operations and operational and nongaap financial data will vary in the future these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future quarter or year 



 

 

 

 



  



  

 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 



seasonality 

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased gms and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower gms and revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2019 decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018  we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quartertoquarter for all periods presented above other than the first quarter of 2019  corresponding to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue and gms growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following tables show our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable longterm investments and net working capital as of the dates indicated 



as of december 31 2019  our cash and cash equivalents a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds were held in the united states for future investments working capital funding and general corporate purposes 

we invest in short and longterm instruments including fixedincome funds and us government and agency securities aligned with our investment strategy these investments are intended to allow us to preserve our principal maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs deliver positive yields across a balanced portfolio and continue to provide us with direct fiduciary control in accordance with our investment policy all investments have maturities no longer than 37 months with the average maturity of these investments maintained at 12 months or less 

sources of liquidity 

in september 2019  we issued the 2019 notes pursuant to the securities act the initial conversion price of the 2019 notes represented a premium of approximately 475 over the price of etsys common stock the net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 notes were 6395 million after deducting initial purchasers discount and offering expenses the 2019 notes will mature on october 1 2026  unless earlier converted or repurchased for more information on the 2019 notes  see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

on february 25 2019  we entered into a 2000 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with several lenders the “ 2019 credit agreement ” the 2019 credit agreement will mature in february 2024  the 2019 credit agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of 300 million and a swingline loan sublimit of 100 million  see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in march 2018  we issued the 2018 notes pursuant to the securities act the initial conversion price of the 2018 notes represented a premium of approximately 375 over the price of etsy’s common stock the net proceeds from the sale of the 2018 notes were 3350 million after deducting initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses the 2018 notes will mature on march 1 2023  unless earlier converted or repurchased based on the daily closing prices of our common stock during the quarter ended december 31 2019  holders of the 2018 notes are not eligible to convert their 2018 notes during the first quarter of 2020 when a conversion notice is received we have the option to pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof accordingly we cannot be required to settle the 2018 notes in cash and therefore the 2018 notes are classified as longterm debt as of december 31 2019  for more information on the 2018 notes  see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in “ key factors affecting our performance ” above and in our “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments are held in the united states we fund our international operations from our funds held in the united states on an asneeded basis 

historical cash flows

our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platform as well as associated cost of revenue and other operating expenses our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers net cash provided by operating activities in each period presented has been influenced by changes in working capital

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with stockbased compensation income taxes including the evaluation of uncertain tax positions purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of the acquired intangibles purchased in a business combination and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases including determining the incremental borrowing rate and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services to help sellers generate more sales and scale their businesses we recognize revenue as we transfer control of promised goods or services to sellers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control of the specified goods or services by considering if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise have inventory 

risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers among other factors based on our evaluation of these factors revenue is recorded either gross or net of costs associated with the transaction with the exception of shipping labels our revenues are recognized on a gross basis sales and usagebased taxes are excluded from revenues 

etsycom marketplace revenue as members of the etsycom marketplace etsy sellers receive the benefit of marketplace activities including listing items for sale completing sales transactions and payments processing which represents a single standready performance obligation etsy sellers pay a fixed listing fee of 020 for each item listed on etsycom for a period of four months or if earlier until a sale occurs variable fees include the 5 transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged and fees for processing payments including foreign currency payments on july 16 2018  we increased our seller transaction fee from 35 to 5 of each completed transaction and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item payments processing fees vary between 30 to 45 of an item’s total sale price including shipping plus a flat fee per order depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located when a foreign currency payment is processed an additional transaction fee is applied 

the listing fee is recognized ratably over a four month listing period unless the item is sold or the seller relists it at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized the transaction fee and payments processing fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is consummated listing fees are nonrefundable while transaction fees and payments processing fees are recorded net of refunds 

marketplace revenue also includes revenue generated through our commercial partnerships which was recorded in its own other revenue line prior to the fourth quarter of 2019 

reverbcom marketplace revenue the reverb seller transaction fee is a variable fee which is 35 of each completed transaction including both the cost of the item and the shipping there are no reverb listing fees variable fees also include payments fees for processing payments including foreign currency payments payments processing fees vary between 25  27 of an item’s total sale price including shipping plus a flat fee per order depending on the currency in which a listing is denominated 

etsycom services revenue services revenue is derived from optional services we offer to etsy sellers which primarily include advertising services formerly promoted listings and shipping labels each service below represents an individual obligation that we must perform when an etsy seller chooses to use the service 

 reverb services revenue  reverb has its own onsite advertising service called bump advertising reverb sellers have the ability to determine their own ad rate as a percentage of their item’s final sale price revenue from bump advertising is recognized at the time the item is sold reverb also provides its sellers access to purchase shipping labels at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through its platform revenue from shipping labels consists of fees a reverb seller pays when they purchase shipping labels directly through the reverb platform net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels reverb recognizes shipping label revenue when a reverb seller purchases a shipping label reverb recognizes shipping label revenue on a net basis as it is an agent in this arrangement and does not take control of shipping labels prior to transferring the labels to the reverb seller shipping label revenue is recorded net of refunds 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased compensation awards in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic 718 —compensation—stock compensation “asc 718” stock options and rsus are awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and are measured at fair value at each grant date for both options and rsus vesting is typically over a four year period and is contingent upon continued employment on each vesting date in general options granted to newlyhired employees prior to july 2018 vest 25 after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period in general rsus granted to newlyhired employees prior to july 2018 vest 25 after the first year following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12quarter period in general for current employees who received an additional grant prior to march 2018 options vest ratably each month over a 48 month period in general for current employees who received an additional grant prior to march 2018 rsus vest ratably each quarter over a 16quarter period following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant 

beginning in july 2018 in general  for newlyhired employees both options and rsus vest 25 after the first year of service and ratably each six month period over a four year period following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the month closest to the date of grant beginning in march 2018 in general for current employees who receive an additional grant both options and rsus vest ratably each six month period over a four year period following the vesting commencement date  

stockbased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq on the grant date the company recognizes forfeitures as they occur we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

key assumptions 

our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 



 in determining the fair value of stock options granted the following weightedaverage assumptions were used in the blackscholes optionpricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated 



income taxes 

we account for the income tax benefit based on income before income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law the tcja requires us to make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to global intangible low taxed income “gilti” as a current period expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes the “deferred method” we recorded tax expense related to gilti in our effective tax rate beginning in 2018 and have elected to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti using the period cost method 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement 

we recognize interest and penalties if any associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheets 

business combinations intangible assets and goodwill 

in accordance with the guidance for business combinations we determine whether a transaction is a business combination which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting if the assets acquired are not a business we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition under both methods the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date the results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including estimates of future revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ materially from estimates our estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed any change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and impacts our preliminary estimates is recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities whichever is earlier the adjustments will affect our earnings 

acquisitionrelated expenses incurred by the company in a business combination are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment 

test management has determined that we have two operating segments which qualify for aggregation as one reportable segment for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance as a result we have determined we have two reporting units we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the two reporting units conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019 no goodwill impairment was recognized 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then additional impairment testing is not required however if we conclude otherwise we are then required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment 

the quantitative assessment involves comparing the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with its respective book value including goodwill if we determine that the estimated fair value exceeds book value goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary if however we determine that the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

leases 

at the inception of an arrangement the company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present operating leases are included in other assets other current liabilities and other liabilities on the company’s consolidated balance sheets finance leases are included in property and equipment net finance lease obligations current and finance lease obligations net of current portion on the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as rightofuse “rou” assets lease obligations and if applicable longterm lease obligations in the line items cited above the company has elected not to recognize leases with terms of one year or less on the consolidated balance sheet lease obligations and their corresponding rou assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term as the interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable the company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment certain adjustments to the rou asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received the lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option 

the components of a lease should be split into three categories lease components including land building or other similar components nonlease components including common area maintenance maintenance consumables or other similar components and noncomponents including property taxes insurance or other similar components however the company has elected to combine lease and nonlease components as a single component the lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straightline basis 

fair value of financial instruments 

in accounting for the issuance of the 2019 and 2018 notes discussed in “ liquidity and capital resources —sources of liquidity” we used estimates and assumptions to calculate the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components by measuring the fair value of similar securities see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for information regarding our recently issued accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting pronouncements please see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments were held in cash deposits money market funds certificates of deposit fixedincome funds and us government and agency securities the fair value of our cash cash equivalents and short and longterm investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the relatively short maturities of these instruments the majority of our current interest expense is attributable to debt discount related to our notes and interest associated with our brooklyn headquarters lease which is accounted for as a finance lease and is not impacted by external factors on interest rates a 10 increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense 

currency risk 

we operate global marketplaces our revenues are denominated in the currencies in which the seller is paid and our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located in addition in the fourth quarter of 2018 etsy launched a redesigned payment account and began processing seller charges in our seller’s ledger currencies prior to this launch only etsy payments revenues were processed in our seller’s ledger currencies as a result of transacting business in multiple foreign currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar 

in the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 19 of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2019 would have been 275  or approximately 100 basis points higher than the reported 265 growth on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the three months ended december 31 2019 would have been 330 compared with the reported 328 growth 

in the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 17 of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2018 would have been 204  or approximately 40 basis points lower than the reported 208 growth 

on january 1 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states which resulted in a us dollardenominated intercompany debt on a eurodenominated ledger that was subject to continued currency exchange rate risk through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we established a new legal entity based in ireland with a us dollar functional currency to help mitigate the currency rate risk on our intercompany debt 

for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease to revenue of 210 million or approximately 26 of total revenue and a currency exchange loss of 115 million for the year ended december 31 2019  this compares to a revenue decrease of 75 million or approximately 12 of total revenue and currency exchange loss of 170 million based on the same analysis performed for the year ended december 31 2018

google cloud we made progress and are on track with our migration to google cloud which we expect to complete by the beginning of 2020 among other anticipated benefits discussed below we believe the migration will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble server capacity on an as needed basis 

search  we continued investing in our machine learning capabilities in order to help buyers find the right selection of products from the over 60 million  items available in our marketplace in 2018 we improved search relevance and began localizing search results by using context specific ranking

our passionate and engaged sellers and buyers 

etsy sellers 

our sellers are the backbone of etsy’s business and what matters most to them is our community of over 39 million  buyers in order to continue to support our sellers’ growth we are focused on making etsy the best place to start and run a creative business we serve those creative entrepreneurs around the world who choose to pursue their passions offering them a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of tools and services to help them run their business and drive sales etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants and have a broad range of personal and professional goals our 2018  seller survey found that 60  of etsy sellers are multichannel sellers and on average etsy is their primary source of sales 

according to the 2018  seller survey 

 

 

 

 

 

our 2018  seller survey found that 32  of etsy sellers were pursuing their creative business as their sole occupation in addition to our 2018  seller survey we conducted a separate survey of our top decile sellers in 2017 key findings included that 95  of our top decile sellers intended to remain with etsy for the next 12 months 



etsy buyers 

etsy supports a community of over 39 million  buyers who value self expression unique items and buying directly from creative entrepreneurs in a 2018 survey of etsycom buyers 78  of buyers agreed that etsy offers products they cannot find anywhere else etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with etsy sellers etsy buyers can also purchase customized items and craft supplies from etsy sellers by shopping on etsycom etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world 

we are focused on driving more new buyers to the platform and encouraging existing buyers to purchase more often new buyers are considered unique buyers that have never made a purchase on etsy during 2018 we had 175 million  new buyers which represented approximately 18 of overall gms gms from new buyers was up   16 yearoveryear gms from existing buyers grew   23 yearoveryear in 2018 and represented approximately 82 of overall gms an increase compared to last year 

repeat buyers represent shoppers who have ever bought on etsy regardless of when their first purchase day occurred we believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2018  approximately 401  of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months a slight increase compared to last year within that category we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers or buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months as of december 31 2018 habitual buyers grew to 20 million  an increase of 217  compared to 2017 this is faster than overall active buyer growth indicating our efforts to convert buyers into more loyal shoppers on the platform are seeing signs of success 



unlike many other ecommerce companies the vast majority of visits come to etsy from organic channels in 2018  85  of visits came to etsycom from an organic source including a large portion from buyers visiting etsycom directly as well as from nonpaid channels such as search social email and push notifications paid visits are attributed to visits generated from our marketing efforts over the last five years paid visits have increased as a percentage of total visits as a result of our increased investment in marketing a visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app a visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity 



etsy seller  buyer retention 

our active sellers and active buyers typically remain so for multiple years for example 331  of active sellers and 375  of active buyers as of december 31 2015 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform and 318  of active sellers and 387  of active buyers as of december 31 2014 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform in addition as of december 31 2018  196  of active sellers have been selling on etsy for more than four years likewise as of december 31 2018  245 of active buyers have been etsy buyers for more than four years 

           



             



see “ management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our performance — growth and retention of active buyers and active sellers ” for more information 

our technology 

our widely respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform for example on average we capture roughly one billion  usergenerated events every day to produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and test features on our website 

our use of machine learning algorithms creates an engaging shopping experience and also helps etsy sellers and etsy buyers connect across our platform we apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery processes enabling shoppers to more easily browse filter and buy that perfect item even when they may not have something specific in mind 

machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our etsycom market into 10  languages which we believe significantly increases the inventory available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and gives etsy sellers access to a truly global audience 

our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform in late 2017 we announced our migration to google cloud which we believe will enable us to focus on growing our core etsycom marketplace prioritize the buyer and seller experience improve our search and discovery effectiveness and increase the pace of launching new features we expect the migration will result in increased engineering efficiency shifting the focus from maintaining onpremise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic we also believe the migration will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed improved page load time and more nimble fulfillment to capacity on an as needed basis in the third quarter of 2018 we achieved a significant milestone by successfully migrating our website and mobile apps to google cloud we expect to complete the migration by the beginning of 2020 

commitment to integrity and transparency 

members of our community rely on us to maintain a trusted marketplace our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers and etsy buyers participating on our platform most fundamentally we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade or unique and assembled with production partners vintage or craft supplies 

transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness for example we publish an annual report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come we also annually report statistics regarding shops that do not meet our guidelines or which list items that are alleged to infringe third party rights in 2018 we closed 3609  etsycom shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 109473  etsycom accounts for nonip policy violations 

additionally we are focused on enhancing customer service for etsy sellers and etsy buyers which we believe bolsters the trustworthiness of our marketplace in 2018 we migrated our legacy support platform to a new thirdparty customer service platform zendesk to improve our customer experience this migration enabled us to introduce live chat for our sellers and dedicated 24x7 phone support for both buyers and sellers 

we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell we also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies for example our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes in 2018 03  of orders resulted in a case we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and etsy buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business 

our strategy 

since mid2017 we have focused our strategy on growing the etsycom marketplace in our six core geographies and executing upon four key initiatives to make etsy a better place to shop and sell these initiatives involved making investments and improvements in search and discovery trust and reliability marketing capabilities and seller tools and services successfully delivering on these initiatives has resulted in significant improvements to and growth of our marketplace 

in order to deliver sustainable longterm growth we are building upon this strategy to incorporate additional elements that we believe over time will make etsy a bestinclass marketplace our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on what we believe are our core competitive advantages or what we think of as our “right to win” 

the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces we will lean into the humanity and vibrancy of our market increasing the connection between buyers and sellers establishing strong trust signals for product quality and customer experience removing barriers to purchase and giving sellers more ways to generate sales and scale their businesses 

ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to drive more new buyers to the website give existing buyers reasons to come back more often encourage buyers to spend more per order and fuel success for our sellers which we believe will drive growth etsy has a significant number of habitual buyers etsy buyers that have purchased 200 or more on etsycom and have made purchases on six or more purchase days in the last 12 months and we believe we have the ability to attract many more buyers like them to etsy and convert them into habitual buyers for example we believe we can deepen engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions we also plan to continue supporting our sellers by focusing on enhancing the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand we believe that we are just getting started improving this virtuous cycle of growth 

further expanding on these two primary components of our longterm strategy we will 

1 focus on the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies 

the first component and foundation of our growth strategy remains to focus on the etsy marketplace in our six core geographies the united states united kingdom canada australia germany and france these six locations are where we have our largest concentrations of buyers and sellers and consequently where we believe we have the most significant opportunities for growth we are building local marketplaces globally deepening local etsy communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of etsy sellers and etsy buyers a barometer of our local market vibrancy is the performance of our international domestic trade route by which we mean gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country gms from this trade route grew approximately 36  in 2018  compared with 2017  making it the fastest growing category of international gms 

in 2018  we announced a referral agreement with dawanda a privately held marketplace for gifts and handmade goods based in germany encouraging its community of buyers and sellers to migrate to the etsy platform this agreement brought meaningful new breadth and depth of inventory to etsy helping to make germany our second largest international market after the united kingdom by domestic activity while we focus on our six core markets we will also continue to evaluate additional geographies in which to make strategic investments for example we have made initial investments to explore growth opportunities in india 

we see significant opportunity to deliver a more localized shopping experience to nonus buyers in the future including investments in the elevation of local products and sellers in search improving nonenglish search and more local specific marketing and campaigns 

2 build a sustainable competitive advantage 

as described above the second component of our goforward strategy is predicated around building a sustainable competitive advantage centered on these four key elements 

our collection of unique items  the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of unique items our marketplace features over 60 million  items listed across dozens  of retail categories and boasts a large assortment of unique handmade vintage and craft supply products from all over the world this unique inventory is the result of having created a community that attracts supports and retains some of the world’s most talented makers in a 2018  survey of etsy buyers 78  agreed that etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else  that something “special in a sea of sameness” we believe our marketplace is the only place where you can find the depth and breadth of oneofakind items including millions that can be customized and personalized the breadth and depth of the special items listed in our marketplace is the linchpin of our longterm strategy however the unique nature of these items requires that we invest in the other three parts of our longterm strategy search and discovery human connections and our trusted brand in order deliver a bestinclass marketplace experience 

bestinclass search and discovery  we are focused on continuing to develop a search and discovery experience that unlocks the value of the unique items in our marketplace with millions of items listed on etsycom that don’t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit “sku” our challenge is delivering worldclass search and discovery technology that surfaces the right product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive sales and buyer satisfaction we are utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to help personalize the search experience and enable buyers to more easily browse filter and find the item they desire 

in 2018  we significantly enhanced the search and discovery experience in our marketplace we leveraged context specific search ranking “csr” by adding even more attributes such as location and shipping prices into our ranking algorithm to deliver more relevant results we also began to leverage user generated content introduced a new discovery feed and discovery badges to inspire buyers to explore more products and expand their search beyond their original intent and optimized landing pages by adding more recommendations and notifications including alerts on listing cards when scarce items appear in other people’s carts 

we will also work to ensure that buyers have more help discovering the perfect item for them since our marketplace is built on over two million individual but largely unknown brands we see significant opportunity to improve how we signal high quality items and deliver a great customer experience to buyers we believe that by personalizing the etsy search and discovery experience we can deepen buyer engagement and drive greater visit and purchase frequency we expect that our transition to cloudbased technology and additional future investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence among other factors will enable us to deliver a bestinclass search experience 

the power of human connections our mission to “keep commerce human” is a vital part of our strategywe will continue to emphasize the role that humans play in every aspect of our marketplace what makes etsy special isn’t just the items in our marketplace it’s also the stories of how those items were brought to life by the hands of real people our buyer experience highlights the story behind each item and also allows buyers to create their own stories by working with a seller to personalize or customize items to their exact specifications in fact data shows that when a buyer reaches out to a seller with a question they are significantly more likely to purchase a listing from that seller and conversion rate goes up as response time gets shorter 

in 2018  we began to streamline the purchase flow for orders that are personalized or customized and made it easier for buyers to connect with sellers to design high quality items on the platform we plan to invest more to make sure that buyers and sellers know that etsy is the destination for personalized items and it is our goal to make buying and selling such items intuitive and easy 

we believe that fostering and elevating the quality of these interactions will also enable us to drive buyer engagement loyalty and purchase frequency and continue to differentiate etsy from other ecommerce platforms shifting over time from our current itemfirst framework to one that highlights shops and sellers is a way to elevate the role of our makers and their creative processes our goal is to bring human connections to life through improvements in member support seller forums 

management our brand and marketing campaigns and other ways that we promote our marketplace lastly we plan to deepen loyalty by creating opportunities for buyers to experience etsy across categories and occasions 

a brand you can trust  we will continue to focus on being a brand that inspires trust in our customers across the buyer journey  when they search purchase anticipate and receive their special items and all the steps in between since our sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items we aim to ensure that the etsy brand is recognized and valued for providing an excellent endtoend experience there are two key elements to being a trusted brand standing for something that customers understand and rely on and delivering a purchasing experience that feels safe and supportive our goal is to bolster trust in the etsy brand etsy sellers the items available in our marketplace and in the overall etsy experience in 2018  we improved buyer confidence with the launch of several new products including a new iteration of guest checkout on mobile web an alternative payment option common to german buyers and an improved purchase path for items that are personalized or customized we also made significant progress in customer support by partnering with zendesk a customer service software company our zendesk partnership has enabled us to launch live chat and dedicated 24x7 phone support which has improved the support experience for our buyers and sellers 

we plan to continue to optimize the core buyer shopping experience  to make it less fragmented and to remove friction this will involve making sure that buyers can find what they want can easily keep exploring for inspiration and have the right information to make a purchase decision at every step along the way we see significant room for additional improvements to our landing pages our ability to surface recommendations so buyers do not hit dead ends and to make sure we are surfacing relevant purchase information by focusing on shipping enhancements and transparent delivery and returns we can help buyers better understand what to expect across etsy 

in addition we plan to evolve our marketing strategy and investments to reinforce our core brand promise in the hearts and minds of buyers we believe that we can continue to grow our acquisition marketing efforts we expect to add new marketing channels optimize our spend in these channels and work with sellers to help them better understand the impact of marketing on their business for example with improved seller analytics tools and to promote their shops to etsy buyers

‡ metrics for which historical data has also been subject to previous attest procedures 

competition 

we compete for etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software to small businesses an etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform we are able to compete for etsy sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our marketplace and the breadth of our online presence the number and engagement of etsy buyers our seller tools and services our seller education resources our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for etsy buyers based on the unique goods that etsy sellers list in our marketplace our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience customer service our reputation as a trusted marketplace our mobile apps the availability of fair and free shipping offered by etsy sellers ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws including patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws in the united states and abroad we also use confidentiality procedures defensive licensing and acquisitions nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect etsy and our intellectual property 

we file patents and register domain names trademarks copyrights and service marks in the united states and abroad we rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks we also use internal and external brand protection mechanisms that are intended to protect etsy’s brand from misuse by third parties 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example us federal and state laws eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws 

available information 

we are subject to the informational requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended “the exchange act” and file or furnish reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports are available free of charge on our website at investorsetsycom as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed or furnished them to the sec the information on our website is not incorporated into this annual report and investors should not rely on such information in deciding whether to invest in our common stock copies of our sec reports and other documents are also available without charge by sending a letter to investor relations etsy inc 117 adams street brooklyn ny 11201 by sending an email to iretsycom or by calling 347 3827582

 item 1a risk factors  

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other information in this annual  report on form 10k  if any of these risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected as a result the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

in addition we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

if we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy or if our strategy proves to be ineffective our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

  

our ability to execute our strategy is dependent on a number of factors including the ability of our senior management team and key team leaders to execute our strategy our ability to maintain our pace of product experiments coupled with the success of such initiatives and introduce offerings that meet the changing needs of our sellers and buyers and the ability of our employees to perform at a highlevel if we are unable to execute our strategy if our strategy does not drive the growth that we 

anticipate or if our market opportunity is not as large as we have estimated it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our business financial performance and growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of etsy buyers and etsy sellers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active buyers and active sellers for example our revenue is driven by the number of the number of active buyers and buyer engagement as well as active sellers and seller engagement we must encourage buyers to return to etsy and purchase items in our marketplace more frequently we must also continue to encourage etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our services 

we believe that many new etsy buyers and etsy sellers find etsy by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing etsy buyers and etsy sellers if existing etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of competitive shipping costs inadequate customer service lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by etsy sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us likewise if existing etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform they may stop listing items in our marketplace and using our services and may stop referring others to us under any of these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new etsy buyers and etsy sellers without incurring additional expense 

our gms and revenue is concentrated in our most active buyers and sellers if we lose those buyers and sellers our financial performance and growth could be harmed even if we are able to attract new etsy buyers and etsy sellers to replace the ones that we lose they may not maintain the same level of activity and the gms and revenue generated from new etsy buyers and etsy sellers may not be as high as the gms and revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplace if we are unable to retain existing etsy buyers and etsy sellers and attract new etsy buyers and etsy sellers who contribute to an active community our business financial performance and growth would be harmed 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures if demand for the goods that etsy sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain etsy buyers and our business would be harmed trends in sociallyconscious consumerism and buying unique rather than mass produced goods could also shift or slow which would make it more difficult to attract new etsy buyers and etsy sellers our growth would also be harmed if the shift to ecommerce does not continue 

we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

we generated net income of 775 million  and 818 million and incurred a net loss of 299 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively we may not maintain profitability in the future our costs may increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform including our services and technological enhancements and increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and hire additional employees these efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses in addition our revenue may decline for a number of reasons including those described elsewhere in these risk factors 

further our revenue growth rate may decelerate in the future for a number of reasons including the deceleration of our gms growth rate for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “ management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue ” you should not rely on growth rates of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns natural disasters public health crises political crises or other unexpected events 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available in our platform may be reduced this would cause our marketplace and services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business conversely if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplace could decline in addition currency exchange rates may directly and indirectly impact our business for example continued uncertainty around the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union or eu commonly referred to as brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility which may strengthen the us dollar against foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies our translation of foreign currency denominated gms and revenue will result in lower us denominated gms and revenue currency exchange rates may also dampen demand from buyers outside the united 

states for goods denominated in us dollars which could impact gms and revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 83  of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political instability or crises terrorist attacks war or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers certain events such as hurricanes and other natural disasters and political instability are likely to impact buyer behavior for discretionary goods and sellers’ ability to run their businesses on our marketplace and ship their goods these kinds of events may also impact consumer perceptions of wellbeing and security which may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending if any of these events occurs our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success 

our ability to attract retain and motivate employees including our management team is important to our success we strive to attract retain and motivate employees from our office administrators to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the number or caliber of employees we need to maintain our competitive position 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

 filling engineering product management and other technical positions particularly in new york city and san francisco is challenging qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 

in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief technology officer or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

if we experience increased voluntary attrition in the future and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success if we are unable to maintain them our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could suffer 

we have built a trusted marketplace that embodies our valuesbased culture and continue to focus on ensuring that we deliver trust and reliability throughout the buyer experience on etsycom our reputation depends upon our etsy sellers their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

 in particular we are focused on enhancing customer service for etsy sellers and etsy buyers and have migrated our legacy support platform to a new thirdparty customer service platform we plan to introduce new customer service features and tools to support a positive user experience on our platform if our efforts to enhance customer service are unsuccessful or if our new customer service platform fails to meet our needs we may need to invest additional resources in customer service and our ability to maintain a trustworthy marketplace could be harmed 

if we are unable to maintain a trustworthy marketplace and encourage connections among members of our community then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep pace with technological changes and enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers our business financial performance and growth may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands and we are not able to predict the effect of these changes on our business the technologies that we currently use to support our platform may become inadequate or obsolete and the cost of incorporating new technologies into our products and services may be substantial we strive to respond to evolving customer needs and regularly launch new products features and services including for example our recently announced seller subscription packages and tools etsy sellers and etsy buyers however may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs or create value for them additionally as we experiment with new offerings or changes to our platform etsy sellers and etsy buyers may find these changes to be disruptive and may perceive them negatively in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for public launch is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive gms or revenue growth may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy etsy sellers and etsy buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing them which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and services is important to our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers one of the key parts of our strategy is to create more habitual buyers by inspiring purchases across multiple categories and special occasions in addition one of the primary goals of our 2018 pricing increase was to enable us to make further investments in marketing designed to attract more buyers to etsy generating a meaningful return on our investments in marketing initiatives however may be difficult particularly as we anticipate that our marketing investments will be more speculative in the future in addition there can be no assurance that we will deploy additional funds resulting from our 2018 pricing increase effectively 

the marketing efforts we implement may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans external factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives our primary marketing efforts currently include search engine optimization search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as social media mobile push notifications and email additionally we have begun experimenting with television and digital video advertising we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and therefore reduce the number of visits to our marketplace in addition search engines and other thirdparties typically require compliance with their policies and procedures which may be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities and gms the growing use of online adblocking software including on mobile devices may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more etsy buyers to our platform in addition ongoing privacy regulatory changes such as the eu general data protection regulation may impact the scope and effectiveness of marketing and advertising services generally including those used on our platform 

we also obtain a significant number of visits through email if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to etsy sellers and etsy buyers or if etsy sellers and etsy buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected social networking websites such as facebook and pinterest are another important source of visits to our marketplace as ecommerce and social networking evolve we must continue to evolve our marketing tactics accordingly and if we are unable to do so our business could be adversely affected 

if the mobile solutions available to etsy sellers and etsy buyers are not effective the use of our marketplace could decline 

purchases made on mobile devices by consumers including etsy buyers have increased significantly in recent years the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices etsy sellers’ ability to manage and scale their businesses may be harmed and consequently our business may suffer further although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both etsy sellers and etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device we depend on etsy sellers and etsy buyers using our mobile apps for the optimal mobile experience mobile web conversion rate is about half  the conversion rate on desktop and the conversion rate on our mobile buy on etsy app is about 12 x the desktop conversion rate therefore if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains and result in less gms and revenue for us 

as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them in addition supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources 

the success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as 



if etsy sellers and etsy buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices our business financial performance and growth may be adversely affected 

expanding our community outside of the united states is part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

our vision is both global and local and we are focused on growing our business outside of the united states   although we have a significant number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers outside of the united states we are a usbased company with less experience developing local markets outside the united states and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform to local markets 

despite our execution efforts the goods that etsy sellers list on etsycom may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy brand as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to etsycom from etsy buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that most of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in us dollars 

our ability to grow our international operations may also be adversely affected by any circumstances that reduce or hinder crossborder trade for example the shipping of goods crossborder is typically more expensive and slower than domestic shipping and often involves complex customs and duty inspections and the dependency of national postal carrier systems 

our success outside the united states depends upon our ability to attract etsy sellers and etsy buyers from the same countries in order to enable the growth of local markets if we are not able to expand outside of the united states successfully our growth prospects could be harmed an inability to develop etsy’s community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states on a costeffective basis could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand our operations local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

continued expansion outside of the united states may also require significant financial investment for example in june 2018 we announced a referral agreement with dawanda a german ecommerce marketplace which encouraged the migration of dawanda buyers and sellers to etsy’s marketplace and helped expand etsy’s presence in central europe etsy also made initial investments to explore growth opportunities in india a dynamic market where we have limited operating experience we plan to invest in seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect or unsuccessful 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 



 etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if etsy sellers are not our business could be adversely affected in particular etsy buyers and sellers seeking to engage in crossborder sales may become subject to an increasing number of barriers to international trade such as tariffs customs or other taxes 

if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the united states and cannot manage these risks effectively the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets 

legal political and economic uncertainty surrounding the planned exit of the united kingdom from the european union may be a source of instability in international markets create significant currency fluctuations adversely affect our operations in the united kingdom and pose additional risks to our business revenue financial condition and results of operations 

on march 29 2017 the united kingdom formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu it is unclear how long it will take to negotiate a withdrawal agreement but it appears likely that brexit will continue to involve a process of lengthy negotiations between the united kingdom and eu member states to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the eu 

lack of clarity about future uk laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu rules and regulations to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws and employment laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom increase costs depress economic activity and restrict access to capital in addition depending on the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members the longterm effects of brexit will depend on any agreements or lack thereof between the united kingdom and the eu and in particular any arrangements for the united kingdom to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

such a withdrawal from the eu is unprecedented and it is unclear how the united kingdom’s access to the european single market for goods capital services and labor within the eu or the european single market and the wider commercial legal and regulatory environment will impact our uk operations including our sellers and buyers in the united kingdom we may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations the announcement of brexit has already created economic uncertainty and its consequences could adversely impact our business revenue financial condition and results of operations 

regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business 

in addition to the actual and potential changes in law described elsewhere in these risk factors global developments in privacy and data security regulations are changing some of the ways we and our vendors collect use and share personal information compliance with these changing regulations have necessitated some specific product changes for our nonus activities in may 2018 the general data protection regulation “gdpr” went into effect in the eu effectively extending the scope of eu data protection law to all noneu companies processing data of eu persons the gdpr seeks to harmonize the data protection regulations throughout the entire eu the regulation contains numerous requirements and changes from existing eu law including more robust obligations on data processors greater rights for data subjects requiring potentially significant changes to both our technology and operations security and accountability obligations and significantly heavier documentation and recordkeeping requirements for data protection compliance programs specifically the gdpr introduced numerous privacyrelated changes for companies operating in the eu including greater control over personal data by data subjects eg the “right to be forgotten” increased data portability access and redress rights for eu consumers data breach notification requirements increased rules for online and email marketing and stronger regulatory enforcement regimes the 

gdpr requirements apply to some thirdparty transactions such as commercial contracts with partners and vendors and to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including user and employee information gdpr requirements may also apply depending on interpretation of its reach to some users in etsy’s worldwide community of sellers we may experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new eu sellers or new sellers selling into the eu due to the legal requirements compliance cost potential risk exposure and uncertainty for them in respect of their own compliance obligations with respect to gdpr in addition although etsy sellers are independent businesses it is possible that a privacy authority could deem etsy jointly and severally liable for actions of etsy sellers which would increase our potential liability exposure and costs of compliance which could negatively impact our business we could face potential liability regulatory investigation and costly litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance 

gdpr the recently passed california consumer privacy act and similar laws coming into effect in other jurisdictions may continue to change the data protection landscape globally and could result in potentially significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business some of these requirements introduce friction into the buying and selling experience on etsy and may impact the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts which could negatively impact our business and future outlook noncompliance with these laws could result in proceedings against us by data protection authorities other public authorities thirdparties or individuals under gdpr alone noncompliance could result in fines up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company whichever is greater 

in addition the laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside of the eu continue to evolve and remain uncertain   although we are taking steps to comply and mitigate the potential impact to us the efficacy and longevity of these steps are uncertain we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from the eu in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business in the meantime the evolving data protection landscape also creates uncertainty as to how to comply with eu privacy law including potentially inconsistent guidance rulings or requirements from multiple authorities in the eu as well as in the us and worldwide further we may not be entirely successful in our compliance efforts due to various factors either within our control such as limited internal resource allocation or outside our control such as a lack of vendor cooperation new regulatory interpretations or lack of regulatory guidance in respect of certain gdpr requirements 

our payments system depends on thirdparty providers requires ongoing investment and is subject to evolving laws regulations rules and standards 

etsy buyers primarily pay for purchases using etsy payments or paypal in the united states and other countries where etsy payments is available etsy payments enables our sellers to accept various forms of payments such as credit cards debit cards paypal google wallet apple pay and etsy gift cards 

we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform underlying compliance credit card processing and payment disbursing currency exchange identity verification sanctions screening and fraud analysis services if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate etsy sellers’ ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and certain fraud prevention and detection tools may not be effective which could lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business in addition etsy and our thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that negatively impact payments on etsy we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such service outages and if we are unable to provide an alternative payment solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses could increase if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to etsy sellers some etsy sellers may stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether 

the laws and regulations that govern payments are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally moreover even in regions where such laws have been harmonized regulatory interpretations of such laws may differ as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort to determine whether various laws and licensing regulations relating to payments apply to etsy and to comply with applicable laws and licensing regulations any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources could result in liabilities could cause us significant reputational damage or could force us to stop offering etsy payments in certain markets additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments systems less profitable for example any significant change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations may negatively impact payments on etsy 

we plan to invest ongoing internal resources into our payments tools in order to maintain its existing availability expand into additional markets and offer new payment methods and tools to etsy buyers and sellers if we fail to invest adequate resources 

into payments on etsy or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable payments on etsy may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings which could negatively impact etsy payments usage and our marketplace   further our ability to expand etsy payments into additional countries is dependent upon the thirdparty providers we use to support this service as we expand the availability of etsy payments to additional markets or offer new payment methods to etsy sellers and etsy buyers in the future we may become subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and exposed to heightened fraud risk which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payment processors we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard which are subject to change failure to comply with these rules and certification requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements including as a result of a change in our designation by major payment card providers could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply and could require a change in our business operations in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules or payment card provider rules could lead to increased fees for etsy or etsy sellers which may negatively impact payments on our platform usage of etsy payments and our marketplace 

if sensitive information about members of our community or employees is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are subject to cyber attacks members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services our platform is vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personal or financial information of our members or employees cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property as we grow our business expand internationally and gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we rely on a variety of security measures including security testing encryption of sensitive information and authentication technology we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists in addition we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future security breaches as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional inadvertent or social engineering breaches occurring through our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers in addition if our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers fail to comply with our internal security policies and practices member or employee data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

we are also reliant on the security practices of our third party service providers which may be outside of our direct control additionally some of our third party service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive member data if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or experience a breach of their networks our members’ data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face potential liability regulatory investigation costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining a trusted marketplace 

adherence to our guiding principles and our focus on our mission and longterm sustainability may negatively influence our financial performance further our reputation could be harmed if we fail to meet our impact strategy goals 

we intend to operate in line with our guiding principles focus on the longterm sustainability of our business and work toward our mission to “keep commerce human” we may take actions in line with our mission and guiding principles that we believe will benefit our business and therefore our stockholders over a longer period of time even if those actions do not maximize short or mediumterm financial performance however these longerterm benefits may not materialize within the time frame we expect or at all for example 



 

additionally we have developed an impact strategy that focuses on leveraging etsy’s core business to generate value for our community and stakeholders through positive economic social and environmental efforts our impact strategy aims to create more economic opportunity for sellers greater diversity in our workforce and build longterm resilience by reducing our carbon footprint if we don’t demonstrate progress against our impact strategy or if our impact strategy is not perceived to be adequate our reputation could be harmed 

failure to deal effectively with fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business 

although we have measures in place to detect and limit the occurrence of fraudulent and other illegal activity in our marketplace those measures may not always be effective 

for example etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data under current credit card chargeback rules we could be held liable for orders placed through etsy payments with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent transactions we may not be able to do so effectively as a result our business could be adversely affected we could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or payment card association rules or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace 

we have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to ensure compliance with anticorruption antimoney laundering export controls and trade sanctions requirements in addition as stated elsewhere in these risk factors we rely upon thirdparty service providers to perform certain underlying compliance credit card processing identity verification and fraud analysis services if we or our service providers do not perform adequately certain of our fraud prevention and detection tools may not be effective which could lead to potential legal liability and negatively impact our business 

negative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent illegal or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers and damage our reputation 

we are subject to risks related to our corporate social responsibility metrics 

we voluntarily report certain corporate social responsibility metrics this transparency is consistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the positive economic social and environmental impact we want to have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy these metrics whether it be the standards we set for ourselves andor our failure to meet such metrics may influence our reputation and the value of our brand for example the perception held by etsy buyers or sellers our partners or vendors other key stakeholders or the communities in which we do business may depend in part on the metrics we have chosen to aspire to and whether or not we meet these metrics on a timely basis if at all while selected metrics receive limited assurance from an independent third party this is inherently a less rigorous process than reasonable assurance sought in a typical auditing engagement our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our business financial performance or growth 

by electing to set and share publicly these corporate social responsibility metrics our business may also face increased scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities as a result we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report such as economic security and personal empowerment diversity and inclusion energy and water management carbon footprint and data privacy or if we are perceived not to have rigorously measured our achievement against such metrics any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could impact employee engagement and retention the willingness of etsy buyers and sellers and our partners and vendors to do business with us or investors willingness to purchase or hold shares of our common stock any of which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through 

commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform such as bigcommerce and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy sellers based on many factors including 

 in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer including large ecommerce marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba national retail chains such as west elm or target local consignment and vintage stores social commerce channels like instagram eventdriven platforms and vertical experiences like zola and wayfair and other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for etsy sellers to match 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy buyers based on many factors including 

 many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do 

they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do additionally we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to etsy buyers 

a small portion of etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform for example etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by an etsy seller or that an etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions 

negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers or damage our reputation a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements although we are focused on enhancing customer service our efforts may be unsuccessful and etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be disappointed in their etsy experience and not return 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to etsy buyers could harm etsy sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of etsy sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of etsy sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of etsy buyers which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our mission and guiding principles makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by etsy sellers or other members of our community our policies promote legal and ethical business practices such as encouraging etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions however we do not control etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform 

the reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as the number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers volume of traffic number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow the operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex and we could experience operational failures if we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability the investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our business and to improve our operating results in the long term but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce profitability in the near term 

we also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet cloud and mobile infrastructure and increasingly rely on the availability features cost and reliability of thirdparty service providers and platforms for example this includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products 

thirdparty providers host much of our technology infrastructure and are likely to host more in the future any disruption in their services or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide such as security concerns our efforts to update our infrastructure may not be successful or may take longer than anticipated if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology 

infrastructure successfully then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be adversely affected which could harm our growth prospects and our business 

we will rely on google cloud for a substantial portion of our computing storage data processing networking and other services any disruption of or interference with our use of the google cloud operation would adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

google cloud platform provides a distributed computing infrastructure as a service platform for business operations and we are in the process of migrating our data centers to google cloud increasing our reliance on cloud infrastructure as we implement the transition to the cloud there will be occasional planned or unplanned downtime for our websites and apps and potential site delays all of which will impact our sellers’ ability to conduct transactions and our buyers’ ability to purchase items we may also need to divert engineering resources away from other important business operations which could significantly harm our business and growth additionally if the costs to migrate to google cloud are greater than we expect or take significantly more time than we anticipate our business could be harmed 

any transition of the cloud services currently provided by google cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense any significant disruption of or interference with our use of google cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed in addition if hosting costs increase over time and if we require more computing or storage capacity our costs could increase disproportionately if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of google or similar providers our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit infringing or illegal 

although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by etsy sellers we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplace and in certain cases closing the shops of etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability in particular we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by etsy sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where laws may offer less protection for intermediaries and platforms than the united states under current us copyright law and the communications decency act we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on our platform by etsy sellers and etsy buyers however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions these safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably in that event we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of etsy sellers 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by etsy sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platform less userfriendly moreover public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

our business and our etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial taxes goods and services tax business tax withholding tax digital service tax and gross receipt tax to businesses like ours and to etsy sellers and etsy buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear when and how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to etsy sellers’ businesses if etsy is found to be deficient in how it has addressed its tax obligations our business could be adversely impacted 

one or more states the federal government or other countries are seeking to or have recently imposed additional reporting recordkeeping or indirect tax collection and remittance obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce if requirements like these become applicable in additional jurisdictions our business could be harmed for example taxing authorities in certain us states and in other countries have identified ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and are considering related legislation additionally the supreme court’s recent decision in south dakota v wayfair inc et al overturned existing law that sellers are not required to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer’s state as a result of the wayfair decision states or the federal government may adopt or begin to enforce laws requiring etsy sellers to calculate collect and remit taxes on their sales such changes to current law or new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on etsy causes our marketplace to be less attractive to current and prospective etsy buyers which could materially impact our business financial performance and growth additionally new legislation could require us or etsy sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling in our marketplace less attractive 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and laws and regulations focused on ecommerce and online marketplaces such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability intellectual property and consumer protection in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws in some cases nonus privacy data security consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more detailed than those in the united states and in some countries are actively enforced 

these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to online marketplaces as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by online marketplaces or ecommerce for example as described elsewhere in these risk factors laws relating to privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements that are applicable to etsy 

some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of etsy buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business could be adversely affected 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments or the inconsistent enforcement of such laws and regulations could impede the growth of ecommerce or online marketplaces which could have a negative impact on our business and operations examples include data localization requirements limitation on marketplace scope or ownership intellectual property intermediary liability rules regulation of online speech limits on network neutrality and rules related to security privacy or national security which may impede etsy or our users we could also face regulatory challenges or be subject to discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and etsy sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business furthermore the circumstances in which we may be held liable for the acts omissions or responsibilities of our sellers is uncertain complex and evolving for example certain laws have recently been enacted seeking to hold marketplaces like ours responsible for certain compliance obligations for which sellers have traditionally been responsible if an increasing number of such laws are passed the resulting compliance costs and potential liability risk could negatively impact our business 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform which can impact the user experience on etsycom additionally due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platform updates to certain parts of our code including changes to etsy or third party apis on which etsy relies could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platform that negatively impact the user experience and functionality of our marketplace any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in addition we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and etsy sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business in 2015 rules approved by the federal communications commission “fcc” went into effect that prohibited internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain “fast traffic” lanes however those rules were repealed in june 2018 this repeal may make it more difficult or costly for many small businesses such as our community of sellers as well as our buyers to access our platform and may result in increased costs for us which could significantly harm our business and the millions of microbusinesses that utilize our platform we along with other companies and public interest groups are challenging this repeal in the courts but these efforts may not be successful and may be costly 

outside of the united states it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

the actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business specifically responding to common actions of an activist stockholder such as requests for special meetings potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming or divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company which may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which are extremely costly to defend could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims thirdparties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings third parties may also allege a company is secondarily liable for intellectual property infringement or that it is a joint infringer with another party any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters in addition 

some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors and patent holding companies have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where etsy does business we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property to the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software 

the software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by etsy and the internet and technology industries have been interpreted by only a few court decisions and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and in numerous other jurisdictions we record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we could be subject to higher than anticipated tax liabilities as well as ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as audits close and exposures are reevaluated further our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by 

changes in tax laws changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities these changes include among others 1 a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate 2 a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense 3 a shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a quasiterritorial system along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the us income tax base and 4 a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets with the latter taxed at a lower rate notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in january 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states our new corporate structure changed how we use our intellectual property and implemented certain intercompany arrangements we believe this may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate over the long term and other operational efficiencies however the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure moreover these tax laws are subject to change tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences if our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected 

we may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including class action lawsuits for example as described further in “ note 14—commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements a purported securities class action lawsuit was recently dismissed that named etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters any lawsuit to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future acquisitions may divert management’s time and focus from operating our business acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 

 moreover we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect or in the time frame we expect we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

if our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business 

our insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities such as general liability property coverage errors and omissions liability employment liability business interruptions data breaches crime product liability and directors’ and officers’ liability for certain types of business risk we may not be able to or may choose not to acquire insurance in addition our insurance may not adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums andor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain additionally if any of our insurers becomes insolvent it would be unable to pay any claims that we make 

the growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business in the number of etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have etsy sellers and etsy buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future both in the united states and abroad the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed 

operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention 

as a public company we incur substantial legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “the sarbanesoxley act” and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market “nasdaq” also apply to us as part of these requirements we have established and maintained effective disclosure and financial controls and made changes to our corporate governance practices continued compliance with these requirements may increase our legal and financial compliance costs in the future and may make some activities more timeconsuming in addition as described elsewhere in these risk factors as a public company we may be subject to stockholder activism which can lead to additional substantial costs distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations or nasdaq listing requirements adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt in the future we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt when due 

  

our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness including the 0  convertible senior notes due 2023  we issued in march 2018  the “notes” depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures in addition any required repurchase of the notes for cash as a result of a fundamental change would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for us in our business if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations 

  

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt if for example we incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt these actions may diminish our ability to make payments on our substantial debt when due 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which has subsequently been codified as accounting standards codification 47020 —debt with conversion and other options  “asc 47020” under asc 47020 an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of asc 47020 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we will be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we will report lower net income in our financial results because asc 47020 will require interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount under the treasury stock method for diluted earnings per share purposes the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in shares are issued we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility however our credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

 

 

 

 



 

 

these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders any debt financing that we may secure in the future could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for example since january 1 2018 our common stock’s daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 1773 to a high of 5743 through february 21 2019  the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 



 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial performance or growth stock prices of many internet and technology companies have historically been highly volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation we have experienced securities class action lawsuits in the past and may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

if analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our common stock would likely decline if few analysts cover us demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly 

our stock repurchases may not achieve the desired objectives 

in november 2018 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 200 million  of our common stock previously in november 2017 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 100 million  of our common stock which we completed in the second quarter of 2018 there can be no assurance that these stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares in addition there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases in the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of recent and future employee stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility as a result stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

 these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” may delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 of the dgcl imposes certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

overview 

business   

etsy is the global twosided marketplace for unique and creative goods our mission is to “keep commerce human” and we’re committed to using the power of business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people around the world we connect creative entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are intended to be special reflect their sense of style or represent a meaningful occasion 

our sellers are the heart and soul of etsy and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity we have a selleraligned business model we make money when our sellers make money we offer our sellers a marketplace with millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses 

we are focused on attracting potential buyers to the etsy marketplace for “special” purchase occasions throughout the year and deepening engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases across multiple categories and special occasions these special purchase occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include shopping that reflects an individuals unique style gifting that demonstrates thought and care and celebrations that express creativity and fun buyers tell us that they come to etsy because etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else special purchase occasions happen throughout the year when a buyer is decorating a home dressing for an event celebrating a special moment or buying a gift for someone special 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to etsy sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses 

marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees an etsy seller pays us for marketplace activities marketplace activities include listing an item for sale completing transactions between a buyer and a seller and using etsy payments to process payments including foreign currency payments revenue from etsy payments our payment processing product included in services revenue prior to 2018 is now included in marketplace revenue because etsy payments is required to be used by etsy sellers in the countries where it is available 

services revenue called seller services revenue prior to 2018 is comprised of the fees an etsy seller pays us for our optional other services “services” services include promoted listings our onsite advertising service that allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results etsy shipping labels which allows sellers in the united states canada united kingdom and australia to purchase discounted shipping labels pattern a service that allows sellers to build custom websites and etsy plus a subscription offering that provides sellers with enhanced tools and credits for use on our platform 

we also generate additional revenue through our commercial partnerships which is classified as other revenue 

our strategy is focused on growing our etsycom marketplace in our six core geographies and building a sustainable competitive advantage around four areas of our business that we believe differentiate us from our competitors or what we call our “right to win” 

the foundation of etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of unique items which we believe when combined with bestinclass search and discovery human connections and a trusted brand will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces our investments in product marketing and talent will be focused on capitalizing on these four areas of our business ultimately the goal of our longterm strategy is to drive more new buyers to the website give existing buyers reasons to come back more often and fuel success for our sellers 

year highlights 

total revenue was 6037 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue in the year ended december 31 2018  we recorded net income  of 775 million  and nongaap adjusted ebitda of 1395 million  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

as of december 31 2018  our marketplace connected 21 million  active etsy sellers and 394 million  active etsy buyers in nearly every country in the world in the year ended december 31 2018  etsy sellers generated gms of 39 billion  of which approximately 55  came from purchases made on mobile devices we are a global company and 35  of our gms in the year ended december 31 2018  came from transactions where either an etsy seller or an etsy buyer was located outside of the united states 

2018 pricing updates 

effective july 16 2018 we increased our seller transaction fee from 35 to 5 and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item the revised fee structure is intended to support increased investments in the growth and health of the marketplace we believe these pricing updates will continue to have a positive effect on revenue  

we also announced new subscription packages and enhanced tools that are intended to support global sellers at different stages of their business life cycles in midjuly we launched etsy plus which sellers can opt into for 10 per month sellers may also choose etsy standard and continue to have access to the same tools and services that are already available on etsy without an additional monthly fee given that our learnings on subscription packages are still nascent we are continuing to evaluate and learn from the recent launch of etsy plus and will evaluate the best strategy for our current and planned subscription packages going forward as we optimize for seller success 

other operational highlights 

in 2018 we focused on growing our etsycom marketplace in our core geographies and owning special purchase occasions – style gifting and celebrations – throughout the year below are key operational highlights 



all seller shop finances in one place and have begun to process charges in the seller’s ledger currency and automatically deduct fees and applicable taxes from the seller’s money earned through sales using etsy payments 

we have also focused on growth investments such as our migration to google cloud in 2018 we achieved a significant milestone in the process by successfully migrating our website and mobile apps to google cloud we expect to complete the migration by the beginning of 2020 and anticipate spending approximately 25 million  on cloud migration in 2019 additionally during the migration we will maintain some of our existing data center infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our platform we believe that moving to google cloud is positioning us well for growth by allowing us to focus on strategic initiatives enhance site performance and improve engineering efficiency 

reclassification of revenue categories 

in connection with the adoption of asu 201409 —revenue from contracts with customers  “asc 606” in the first quarter of 2018 we renamed our revenue categories marketplace and services revenue in addition we reclassified etsy payments from services to marketplace revenue as described in “ business ” above 

the following table provides our marketplace and services revenue under our previous and current presentation for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 

key operating and financial metrics   

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health and performance of our business and allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments the unaudited nongaap financial measure and key operating and financial metrics we use are 



gms 

gross merchandise sales “gms” is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by etsy gms is largely driven by transactions in our marketplace and is not directly impacted by services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of etsy sellers the satisfaction of etsy buyers and the health scale and growth of our business 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net income loss  adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net  benefit provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  foreign exchange loss gain  restructuring and other exit costs income related to the actions discussed in “ nongaap financial measures ” asset impairment charges  acquisitionrelated expenses  net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities  and contributions to good work institute formerly etsyorg  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda including its limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is an etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include marketplace services and other revenue fees discussed in “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  —revenue recognition” in the notes to consolidated financial statements an etsy seller is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy seller accounts we succeed when etsy sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our business 

active buyers 

an active buyer is an etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months an etsy buyer is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy buyer accounts we generate revenue when etsy buyers order items from etsy sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of etsy buyers and the health of our business 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes a little market “alm” and etsy wholesale and orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop when calculating percent mobile gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the etsy seller or the shipping address for the etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states when calculating percent international gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

currencyneutral gms growth 

we calculate currencyneutral gms growth by translating current period gms for goods sold that were listed in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates 

as reported and currencyneutral gms growth for the periods presented below is as follows 



nongaap financial measures   

adjusted ebitda 

in this annual report on form 10k we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net income loss  adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net  benefit provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  foreign exchange loss gain  restructuring and other exit costs income related to the actions as defined below asset impairment charges  and acquisitionrelated expenses  below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform 

we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges 

adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income loss  and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income loss  to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 



1 included in interest and depreciation expense amounts above are interest and depreciation expense related to our headquarters under buildtosuit accounting requirements which commenced in may 2016 for the year s ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  those amounts are as follows 



2 27 million  of restructuringrelated stockbased compensation expense has been excluded from the year ended december 31 2017  and is included in the restructuring and other exit costs income line see footnote 4 below total stockbased compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows 



 4 total restructuring and other exit costs income included in the consolidated statements of operations are as follows 



 consolidated statement of operations line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs income 

in the second quarter of 2017 the board of directors approved plans to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure and improve focus on key strategic growth opportunities the “actions” in this annual report we discuss certain financial statement line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs income each nongaap financial measure that represents the income statement line item adjusted to exclude restructuring and other exit costs income incurred in the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  

we have included these financial statement line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs income because the actions were unusual and do not necessarily reflect the ongoing trends in these financial statement line items we believe that these nongaap measures can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of the actions 

these nongaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are

key factors affecting our performance   

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed in the section titled “ risk factors ” 

growth and retention of active buyers and active sellers   

our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active buyers and active sellers our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers buyer engagement active sellers seller engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace as of december 31 2018  our marketplace had grown to 394 million  active buyers and 21 million  active sellers up from 334 million  active buyers and 19 million  active sellers as of december 31 2017  we believe two of our most significant opportunities to drive growth in our marketplace are to bring new buyers to etsy and encourage repeat buyers to purchase more frequently we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers or buyers who have spent 200 or more and made purchases on six or more purchase days in the year we are also focused on keeping our best sellers on the platform and helping them grow their businesses by enhancing the seller tools and services that help drive buyer demand 

during 2018 etsy had 175 million  new buyers or buyers who made their firstever purchase on etsy gms from new buyers was up   16 yearoveryear and represented approximately 18 of overall gms a slight decrease  compared to last year gms from existing buyers grew   23 yearoveryear in 2018 and represented approximately 82 of overall gms an increase compared to last year repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2018  approximately 401  of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months up from 396  in 2017  

habitual buyers are approximately 52  of our active buyers as of december 31 2018  habitual buyers grew to 20 million  as of december 31 2018  an increase of 217  compared to 2017 we aim to increase repeat purchases and habitual buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions building trust in the etsy brand and removing friction from the buying experience to improve conversion rates 

to analyze our retention rates we measure repeat activity by active buyers buyers who have made at least one purchase through etsy in the last 12 months and active sellers sellers who have incurred at least one charge in the last 12 months

investment in marketing 

we are focusing on initiatives to drive traffic to etsycom and shape perceptions of our marketplace as the goto shopping destination for special purchase occasions by investing primarily in digital and other marketing initiatives such as search engine optimization and television channels and in our team to support marketing activities we believe that we can continue to grow our acquisition marketing efforts both in scaling and improving our current efforts and by expanding into new marketing channels in 2018 paid gms attributable to our marketing efforts was 17  of gms and grew 53  compared to 2017 additionally following the increase in our marketplace transaction fee we were able to invest a portion of our incremental revenue into marketing in 2018 we ran our firstever television advertising campaign in the united states and also began to test offline marketing campaigns we believe these campaigns can increase brand awareness visits and purchase intent in 2018  we spent 1580 million  on marketing expenses or 262  of revenue up   449  over 2017  in 2017  we spent 1091 million  on marketing expenses or 247  of revenue up   326  over 2016  

investment in technology 

our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we have made and will continue to make significant investments in our platform to attract buyers and sellers to our marketplace and enhance their experience 

in september 2016 we acquired blackbird technologies inc “blackbird” a machine learning company and during 2017 fully integrated it into our search team during 2017  we launched csr which leverages our internal data to create a more personalized search experience we continued to improve the search experience using csr throughout 2018 and will continue to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable shoppers to more easily browse filter and transact even when they may not have something specific in mind 

our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform in the fourth quarter of 2017 we began working on an initiative to migrate our data centers to the cloud we believe that moving to google cloud will enable us to focus on growing our core etsycom marketplace prioritizing the buyer and seller experience improving our search and discovery effectiveness and increasing the pace of launching new features in the third quarter of 2018 we achieved a significant milestone in the process by successfully migrating our website and mobile apps to google cloud while this initiative is underway we will incur implementation costs in addition to costs associated with maintaining our current infrastructure we expect to complete the migration by the beginning of 2020 

in 2018  we spent 972 million  on product development expenses or 161  of revenue up   303  over 2017  and in 2017  we spent 746 million  on product development expenses or 169  of revenue up   355  over 2016  in addition we capitalized website development and internaluse software costs including stockbased compensation of 221 million  and 108 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively we plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our community and increase our efforts to recruit and hire employees to work on our engineering teams 

investment in connected experience—mobile and desktop

mobile buy on etsy app is about 12 x the desktop conversion rate therefore if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains we are focused on continuing to enhance the buyer experience through mobile offering improvements in 2019 

international growth 

our growth will depend in part on international etsy sellers and international etsy buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community our vision is global and local etsycom is available in 10  languages and supports buyers and sellers in nearly every country in the world in 2018 we entered into a referral agreement with dawanda gmbh “dawanda” a privately held germanybased marketplace for gifts and handmade items as part of this agreement dawanda agreed to encourage its community of buyers and sellers to migrate to the etsy platform the referral agreement with dawanda allowed us to grow our international business by expanding our footprint in central europe particularly in germany one of our core geographic markets international gms was 35  of total gms in 2018  compared to 33  in 2017  we expect international gms to grow faster than us gms in 2019  assuming that currency rates remain stable compared to average levels in december 2018  driven by our efforts to build local communities and foster local connections in 2018  375  of etsy sellers were located outside the united states crossborder transactions is the largest component of international gms and we remain committed to reducing barriers such as language and currency so that sellers and buyers from different countries can easily connect and transact gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country grew approximately 36 in 2018 compared with 2017  making it the fastest growing category of international gms we are also focused on building local marketplaces globally and deepening local etsy communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to execute on our international strategy we plan to continue to invest in local marketing and other locallyrelevant tools and enhancements such as local search boost to encourage these connections around the world

we are focused on employee engagement which is linked with high performance retention innovation and growth each year etsy conducts an internal survey to measure employee engagement in 2018  our overall engagement score was 70  favorable up 10  from the prior year we are also committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace because we firmly believe that diverse backgrounds thoughts and experiences are beneficial to innovation decision making and our business as a whole we are proud that as of december 31 2018 our board of directors and leadership were at least 50  female

during the year ended december 31 2018  mobile gms increased  as a percentage of total gms to approximately 55  up  from approximately 51  for the year ended december 31 2017  we believe this increase  was a result of increased mobile traffic and to a lesser extent continued improvements in our mobile offerings for etsy buyers mobile gms growth  during the year ended december 31 2018  was approximately 30  with mobile web and mobile app gms each continuing to grow faster than desktop gms during the year

listing fee revenue increased at a slower rate than gms primarily due to the issuance of free listings in our international markets including france and germany

marketing 



marketing expenses increased   489 million  or 449  to  1580 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of increased spend on digital marketing related to buyer acquisition and to a lesser extent increased direct marketing expenses associated with our television ad campaigns these increases were offset by decreases in employeerelated expenses due to a reduction in average headcount and 30 million  of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions included in marketing expense for the year ended december 31 2017 that did not recur in 2018 excluding the impact of restructuring and other exit costs nongaap marketing expenses increased 520 million  or 490  in 2019 we expect to increase our investment in marketing including into channels such as television 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased   226 million  or 303  to  972 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation and professional services expenses for consultants working on our product and engineering teams the increase in employeerelated expenses includes approximately 85 million of expense in connection with certain employee departures including 70 million  in expense resulting from the modification of stock options and rsus additionally 32 million  of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions is included in product development expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  excluding the impact of restructuring and other exit costs nongaap product development expenses increased 260 million  or 364

general and administrative expenses decreased   86 million  or 94  to  829 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to decreased employeerelated expenses including stockbased compensation mainly the result of a reduction in average headcount and 70 million  of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  that did not recur in 2018 excluding the impact of restructuring and other exit costs nongaap general and administrative expenses decreased 16 million  or 19  upon adoption of asu 201602 leases in 2019   we expect to recognize additional depreciation and amortization expense compared to the year ended december 31 2018 related to the accounting treatment for our brooklyn headquarters lease 

asset impairment charges 

  



there were no asset impairment charges in the year ended december 31 2018  asset impairment charges were 32 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  in the fourth quarter of 2017 we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings including etsy studio and etsy manufacturing which resulted in the recognition of a 32 million  impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internaluse software assets down to zero this decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the etsycom marketplace 

other expense income net   

  



other expense net  was  197 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  which increased 401 million from other income net of 204 million in the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in expense was primarily driven by the change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on our intercompany and other nonfunctional currency balances and higher interest expense mainly noncash interest related to our convertible debt issued in the first quarter of 2018 partially offset by increased interest and dividend income related to our investment accounts interest expense also includes noncash interest expense associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting related to our corporate headquarters which remained flat yearoveryear upon adoption of asu 201602 leases in 2019   we expect to recognize decreased interest expense compared to the year ended december 31 2018 related to the accounting treatment for our brooklyn headquarters lease 

benefit for income taxes   

  



our income tax benefit  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  was 224 million  and 495 million  respectively 

  

the primary drivers of our income tax benefit  for the year ended december 31 2018 were tax benefit related to valuation allowance of 287 million  stockbased compensation of 117 million  and our research and development tax credit of 41 million  these were partially offset by tax expense related to income before income taxes of 113 million  state and local tax expense of 38 million  and the inclusion of additional taxes of 39 million  due to certain provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as enacted by the us federal government on december 22 2017 the “tcja” 

the primary driver of our income tax benefit  for the year ended december 31 2017  was the impact on deferred taxes from the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 as a result of the tcja which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 our deferred taxes and certain unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 have been revalued at the reduced 21 rate the revaluation resulted in a benefit for income taxes of approximately 311 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

the secondary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was the recognition of excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 —stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this updated guidance we recorded 128 million  of excess tax benefits rather than additional paidin capital for the year ended december 31 2017  

for both periods other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense

revenue reflects a combination of an increase in label volume and average margin per label the increase in pattern revenue was primarily due to the incremental monthly paid subscription periods in 2017 as the product launched in april 2016 with the first paid subscriptions beginning in may 2016 at december 31 2017  150 of active sellers used promoted listings and 281 of active sellers in the united states and canada used etsy shipping labels 

other revenue decreased   26 million  or 444  to 33 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  mainly due to a decrease in revenue from accumulated unused gift card funds received from our thirdparty service provider down 734 in the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 17 million in revenue from accumulated unused gift cards which represented the threeyear cumulative value of gift cards that the thirdparty service provider has concluded are not likely to be redeemed in 2017 unused gift card revenue was recognized monthly as earned and is not anticipated to be significant in future periods in addition processing fees from paypal a thirdparty payment processor decreased 302 as a result of the transition of nearly all sellers in eligible countries to etsy payments in 2017 

cost of revenue 

  



cost of revenue increased   277 million  or 224  to 1510 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of additional costs to support the increase in etsy payments revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in employeerelated costs cost of revenue increased  as a percentage of revenue primarily due to an increase in professional services expenses related to customer service support restructuring and other exit costs of 07 million associated with the actions were included in cost of revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

operating expenses 

there were a total of 744  employees on december 31 2017  compared with 1043  on december 31 2016  reflecting headcount reductions associated with the actions 

marketing 

  



marketing expenses increased   268 million  or 326  to 1091 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of increased spend on digital marketing related to buyer acquisition and an increase in employeerelated expenses in our marketing team including 30 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased   195 million  or 355  to 746 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of an increase in employeerelated expenses in our product and engineering teams up 103 million including 32 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions and 62 million of additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of blackbird in september 2016 

general and administrative 

  



general and administrative expenses increased   53 million  or 62  to 915 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily driven by an increase in employeerelated expenses including 70 million of restructuring and other exit costs associated with the actions this increase was partially offset by decreases in professional services and office overhead expenses 

asset impairment charges 

  



asset impairment charges increased   26 million  or 4739  to 32 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  in the fourth quarter of 2017 we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings including etsy studio and etsy manufacturing which resulted in the recognition of a 32 million impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internaluse software assets down to zero this decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the etsycom marketplace this compares to 06 million in the year ended december 31 2016  related to the impairment of nonrecoverable intangible assets acquired in the alm and jarvis labs inc acquisitions for customer relationships and trademarks 

other income expense net   

  



other income net  was 204 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  which increased 408 million  from other expense net  of 205 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  the increase  in income was primarily driven by the change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on our intercompany and other nonfunctional currency balances partially offset by an increase in interest expense largely associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting related to our corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2017 we established a new legal entity based in ireland with a us dollar functional currency to help mitigate the currency rate risk on our intercompany debt 

benefit provision for income taxes   

  



our income tax benefit  and provision  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  was 495 million  and 270 million  respectively 

the primary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was the impact on deferred taxes from the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law which among other items reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result our deferred taxes and certain unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 have been revalued at the reduced 21 rate the revaluation resulted in a benefit for income taxes of approximately 311 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

the secondary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was the recognition of excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 —stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this updated guidance we recorded 128 million  of excess tax benefits rather than additional paidin capital for the year ended december 31 2017  

the primary driver of the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016  was tax expense related to our updated corporate structure of 171 million 

for both periods other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

quarterly results of operations 

the following tables show selected unaudited quarterly results of operations and other unaudited operational and nongaap financial data for the eight quarters ended december 31 2018  and the percentage that each line item in the following results of operations data represents of revenue the results of operations data for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and includes all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of our results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our quarterly results of operations and operational and nongaap financial data will vary in the future these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future quarter or year 





 

 

 



  



  



the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income loss  to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 



 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings including etsy studio and etsy manufacturing which resulted in the recognition of a 32 million impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internaluse software assets down to zero this decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the etsycom marketplace 

seasonality 

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased gms and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower gms and revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2018  decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017  we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially  quartertoquarter for all periods presented above other than the first quarter of 2018  corresponding  to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue and gms growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

liquidity and capital resources   

the following tables show our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and net working capital as of the dates indicated 



as of december 31 2018  our cash and cash equivalents a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds were held in the united states for future investments working capital funding and general corporate purposes 

we invest in shortterm instruments including fixedincome funds and us government and agency securities aligned with our investment strategy these investments are intended to allow us to preserve our principal maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs deliver positive yields across a balanced portfolio and continue to provide us with direct fiduciary control in accordance with our investment policy all investments have maturities no longer than 36 months with the average maturity of these investments maintained at 12 months or less 

sources of liquidity 

in march 2018  we issued 3450 million aggregate principal amount of 0 convertible senior notes due 2023  the “notes” in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act the initial conversion price of the notes represented a premium of approximately 375 over the price of etsy’s common stock the net proceeds from the sale of the notes were 3350 million  after deducting initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses as of december 31 2018  we had not received any conversion notices and as such the notes are not currently redeemable for cash and are therefore classified as longterm debt for more information on the notes see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in “ key factors affecting our performance ” above and in our “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

subsequent event 

on february 25 2019  we entered into a 2000 million  senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with several lenders the “ 2019 credit agreement ” the 2019 credit agreement  will mature in february 2024  the 2019 credit agreement  includes a letter of credit sublimit of 300 million  and a swingline loan sublimit of 100 million  see “ note 13—debt —subsequent event” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

historical cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities   

our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platform as well as associated cost of revenue and other operating expenses our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers net cash provided by operating activities  in each period presented has been influenced by changes in accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities

net cash provided by operating activities  was 691 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  primarily driven by cash net income  of 688 million  as a result of increased revenue generated on our platform and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided   03 million  in cash

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk in 2018  2017  or 2016  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our future fixed contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  



capital lease obligations consist of obligations under capital leases for computer and hosting equipment 

operating lease obligations consist of obligations under noncancelable operating leases for our headquarters in brooklyn new york and for our offices in san francisco hudson new york london dublin toronto and new delhi

in addition we have uncertain tax positions of 188 million  and nonincome tax related contingency reserves of 09 million  which are not reflected in the table as the ultimate resolution and timing are uncertain 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates   

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and standalone selling price for use in allocating the subscription price stockbased compensation income taxes including the assessment of valuation allowances and the accounting for uncertain tax positions website development costs and internaluse software purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases restructuring and other exit costs income and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services to help etsy sellers to generate more sales and scale their businesses we recognize revenue as we transfer control of promised goods or services to etsy sellers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control of the specified goods or services by considering if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers among other factors based on our evaluation of these factors revenue is recorded either gross or net of costs associated with the transaction with the exception of etsy shipping labels our revenues are recognized on a gross basis sales and usagebased taxes are excluded from revenues 

marketplace revenue  as members of the etsy marketplace etsy sellers receive the benefit of marketplace activities including listing items for sale completing sales transactions and payments processing which represents a single standready performance obligation etsy sellers pay a fixed listing fee of 020  for each item listed on etsycom for a period of four months or if earlier until a sale occurs variable fees include the 5  transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction inclusive of shipping fees charged and etsy payments fees for processing payments including foreign currency payments on july 16 2018  we increased our seller transaction fee from 35  to 5  and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item etsy payments processing fees vary between 3  to 45 of an item’s total sale price including shipping plus a flat fee per order depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located when a foreign currency payment is processed an additional 25  to 5 transaction fee is applied 

the listing fee is recognized ratably over a four month listing period unless the item is sold or the seller relists it at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized the transaction fee and etsy payments fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is consummated listing fees are nonrefundable while transaction fees and etsy payments fees are recorded net of refunds 

services revenue  services revenue is derived from optional services we offer to etsy sellers which include promoted listings etsy shipping labels pattern and etsy plus each service below represents an individual obligation that we must perform when an etsy seller chooses to use the service 

 other revenue  other revenue typically includes revenue generated from commercial partnerships which are recognized as the customer in each contract consumes the benefit of the service we provide in each arrangement 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased compensation awards in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic 718 —compensation—stock compensation  “asc 718” stock options and rsus are awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and are measured at fair value at each grant date for both options and rsus vesting is typically over a four year period and is contingent upon continued employment on each vesting date in general options granted to newlyhired employees prior to july 2018 vest 25 after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period in general rsus granted to newlyhired employees prior to july 2018 vest 25 after the first year following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12quarter period in general for current employees who received an additional grant prior to march 2018 options vest ratably each month over a 48 month period in general for current employees who received an additional grant prior to march 2018 rsus vest ratably each quarter over a 16quarter period following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant 

beginning in july  2018 in general  for newlyhired employees both options and rsus vest 25  after the first year of service and ratably each six month period over a four year period following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the month closest to the date of grant beginning in march 2018 in general for current employees who receive an additional grant both options and rsus vest ratably each six month period over a four year period following the vesting commencement date  

stockbased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq on the grant date in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of guidance in asu 201609 —compensation—stock compensation scope of modification accounting  in reporting periods prior to 2017 we 

estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods as necessary if actual forfeitures differed from estimates we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

key assumptions 

our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

 in determining the fair value of stock options granted the following weightedaverage assumptions were used in the blackscholes optionpricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated 



income taxes 

we account for the income tax provision benefit based on income loss before income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law the tcja requires us to make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to global intangible low taxed income gilti as a current period expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes the “deferred method” we recorded tax expense related to gilti in our effective tax rate for 2018 and have elected to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti using the period cost method 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement 

we recognize interest and penalties if any associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 

website development and internaluse software costs 

costs incurred to develop our website and software for internaluse are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three  to five  years in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended we also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality costs related to the design or maintenance of website development and internaluse software are expensed as incurred we periodically review these capitalized website development and internaluse software costs to determine whether the projects will be completed placed in service removed from service or replaced by other internallydeveloped or thirdparty software if an asset is not expected to provide any future use the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed 

if an asset will continue to be used but the net book value is not expected to be fully recoverable the asset is impaired to its fair value when events or changes in circumstances require we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of website development and internaluse software costs based on its expectations of future profitability undiscounted cash flows and our plans with respect to operations to determine if the asset is impaired and subject to writeoff measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the fair value 

asset acquisitions 

we have completed asset acquisitions and may complete additional asset acquisitions in the future in an asset acquisition we initially determine whether we acquired a single or group of assets acquired assets are recognized based on the purchase price which is presumed to equal the fair value of the net assets acquired and amortized in the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of that entity when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment we accrue for contingent consideration when payout becomes probable and is reasonably estimable 

business combinations intangible assets and goodwill 

we have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future in an acquisition we first review if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets in which case the set is not considered a business and is accounted for as an asset acquisition 

the results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash equity or a combination of the two in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies estimates of future revenue and cash flows discount rates and selection of comparable companies 

when we issue stockbased or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for postcombination services the evaluation includes among other things whether 

the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition date if continued employment is required for vesting the awards are treated as compensation for postcombination services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period 

we initially recognize intangible assets at fair value and we amortize them on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test we have determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then additional impairment testing is not required however if we conclude otherwise we are then required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment 

the quantitative assessment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value including goodwill if we determine that the estimated fair value exceeds book value goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary if however we determine that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

leases 

we lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under noncancelable lease agreements the leases are reviewed for classification as operating capital or buildtosuit leases for operating leases rent is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease period for capital leases we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on the thenoutstanding remaining liability upon adoption of asu 201602 —leases  we will recognize additional operating liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases 

we consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newlyleased office space to determine if we are considered for accounting purposes only to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period if we determine that we are the owner of the construction project we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability “buildtosuit accounting” upon occupancy for buildtosuit leases we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the saleleaseback accounting guidance if the lease meets the saleleaseback criteria we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease if upon completion of construction the project does not meet the saleleaseback criteria the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes 

in may 2016 we took possession of our corporate headquarters in brooklyn new york upon substantial completion of the construction phase of the buildout upon completion of the project we performed a saleleaseback analysis pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” 840 —leases  to determine the appropriateness of removing the previously capitalized assets from the consolidated balance sheets we concluded that components of “continuing involvement” were evident as a result of this review precluding the derecognition of the related assets from the consolidated balance sheets in conjunction with the initiation of the lease in may 2014 we also recorded a facility financing obligation equal to the fair market value of the assets received from the landlord we do not report rent expense for the lease rather rental payments under the lease are recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and interest expense and the associated asset capitalized throughout the construction project is depreciated over its estimated useful life upon adoption of asu 201602 —leases  we will derecognize the facility financing obligation and any gains or losses associated with this change in accounting will be recognized through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of january 1 2019 additionally a new rightofuse asset and lease liability will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the associated lease see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies —recently issued accounting pronouncements” for additional information on the impact of asu 201602 —leases  

restructuring and other exit costs income 

under certain circumstances such as the actions described in “ nongaap financial measures ” we establish restructuring accruals for estimated employee severance and other exit costs these accruals require the use of estimates and though we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they may differ materially from actual costs we include restructuring and other exit costs income in the applicable operating expense category of the impacted function in the consolidated statements of operations see “ note 17—restructuring and other exit costs income ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

fair value of financial instruments 

in accounting for the issuance of the notes discussed in “ liquidity and capital resources —sources of liquidity” we used estimates and assumptions to calculate the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components by measuring the fair value of similar securities see “ note 13—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for information regarding our recently issued accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting pronouncements please see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in cash deposits money market funds fixedincome funds and us government and agency securities the fair value of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the shortterm nature of these instruments the majority of our current interest expense is attributable to our facility financing obligation related to our buildtosuit lease and debt discount related to our notes and is not impacted by external factors on interest rates a 10 increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense 

currency risk 

we are a global marketplace our revenues are denominated in the currencies of our seller’s ledger currencies and our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located in addition in the fourth quarter of 2018 we launched a redesigned payment account and began processing seller charges in our seller’s ledger currencies prior to this launch only etsy payments revenues were processed in our seller’s ledger currencies as a result of transacting business in multiple foreign currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling we are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar 

in the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 17  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2018  would have been 204  or approximately 40 basis points   lower  than the reported 208  growth on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the three months ended december 31 2018  would have been 231  compared with the reported 223  growth 

in the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 15  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2017  would have been 143  or approximately 20  basis points lower than the reported 145  growth 

on january 1 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states which resulted in a us dollardenominated intercompany debt on a eurodenominated ledger that was subject to continued currency exchange rate risk through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we established a new legal entity based in ireland with a us dollar functional currency to help mitigate the currency rate risk on our intercompany debt 

 for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experience in the near term an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease to revenue of 75 million or approximately 12 of total revenue and a currency exchange loss of 170 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  this compares to a revenue decrease of 37 million or 08 of total revenue and currency exchange loss of 225 million  based on the same analysis performed for the year ended december 31 2017

according to the 2016 seller survey 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to our 2016 seller survey we conducted a separate survey of our top decile sellers in 2017 key findings included that 95  of our top decile sellers intended to remain with etsy for the next 12 months 

according to a mckinsey global institute study 2030 of the workingage population or up to 162 million people currently engage in independent work in the us and eu15 the study notes that if all individuals pursued their preferred working style the number of independent workers could grow to up to 268 million source mckinsey global institute  independent work choice necessity and the gig economy we believe that our base of etsy sellers reflects these changing dynamics our 2016  seller survey found that 33  of etsy sellers were pursuing their creative business as their sole occupation up from 30  in our 2014 seller survey 



etsy buyers

see “ managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our performance — growth and retention of active sellers and active buyers ” for more information 

our technology 

the etsy marketplace enables the millions of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices we believe our experienced engineering team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment we update the code that runs the etsy website as often as every 20  minutes and as many as 70  times per day to enhance the performance of our platform we collect and analyze a large volume of data for example we currently capture more than one billion usergenerated events every day to produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and test features on our site 

in 2017  we increased the velocity of experiments focused on etsycom and the rate at which we are going from idea to experiment to test to launch has significantly increased compared with prior years 

our machine learning and machine translation technologies play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect across our platform even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our marketplace into 10  languages significantly increasing the inventory available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and giving etsy sellers access to a truly global audience we also translate conversations and reviews and are applying machine translation to translate promoted listings we are also leveraging our machine learning technology to advance our search capabilities and enable shoppers to more easily browse filter for and buy that perfect item 

in december 2017 we announced our google cloud partnership an initiative that will transition our marketplace and infrastructure to the google cloud platform enabling our technology team to focus on strategic initiatives enhance site performance and improve engineering efficiency googles infrastructure will also enable us to better prioritize technologies like machine learning to personalize the user experience on etsy we expect the transition to google cloud platform to be complete within the next two years 

we strive to offer our sellers and buyers an engaging experience regardless of the device they choose to use to engage with us our mobile website and our “buy on etsy” mobile app for etsy buyers which we developed to keep etsy buyers engaged wherever they are include search discovery curation personalization and social shopping features optimized for the mobile experience additionally our “sell on etsy” mobile app helps the etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders 

for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 66  of our visits and approximately 51  of our gms were generated on a mobile device this is up  compared with 2016  during which 64  of our visits and 48  of our gms were generated on a mobile device we are focused on increasing conversion rates in general however we are particularly focused on mobile web which accounted for 46  of our overall visits in 2017  up from 45  in 2016  and continued to be the largest driver of both overall visits growth and mobile gms growth mobile web conversion rate is about half the conversion rate on desktop and the conversion rate on mobile buy on etsy app is about 12x the desktop conversion rate therefore if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains   

commitment to integrity and transparency 

members of our community rely on us to maintain a trusted marketplace our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers and etsy buyers participating on our platform most fundamentally we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade vintage or craft supplies in 2017 we updated and clarified our policies on etsycom to among other things make it easier for etsy sellers and buyers to understand how we define handmade 

transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness for example we publish an annual report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come we also annually report statistics regarding shops that do not meet our guidelines or which list items that are alleged to infringe third party rights in 2017 we closed 4494 etsycom shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 316801 etsycom accounts for nonip policy violations 

we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell we also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies for example our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes in 2017 03 of orders resulted in a case 

we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and etsy buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business 

our strategy 

our strategy is focused on growing our etsycom marketplace in our six core geographies and owning special purchase occasions – style gifting and celebrations – throughout the year we believe that buyers shop for special occasions many times throughout the year so our goal is to have them think of etsy more often and return to our marketplace more frequently we aim to empower our passionate community of 19 million  sellers to compete and win against mass retailers for special shopping occasions 

in may 2017 we appointed josh silverman as our chief executive officer and rachel glaser as our chief financial officer and in july 2017 we appointed mike fisher as our chief technology officer since joining us our new management team has sought to sharpen our focus on key initiatives and realign our internal resources to pursue the highest growth opportunities in order to deliver value to our stakeholders as part of this realignment we identified and began implementing the following four key initiatives to help us execute on our new strategy 



our mission values and impact strategy 

mission 

etsy’s mission to “keep commerce human” is rooted in our belief that although automation and commoditization are parts of modern life human creativity cannot be automated and human connection cannot be commoditized this is what makes etsy and our marketplace distinct from mass retailers our mission guides our daily decisions sets the path for our longterm success and reinforces our commitments to a positive social economic and environmental impact 

values 

etsys values help ensure that our actions align with our mission and define our expectations behaviors and accountability towards one another our community and our stakeholders we are conducting a review process to ensure that our values continue to meet these ideals our current values are 

we are a mindful transparent and humane business we believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people to demonstrate our commitment we monitor our efforts to minimize the harm and maximize the benefit that we have on people and the planet and then publish an annual progress report to publicly report our results 

we plan and build for the long term  we want to build a company that lasts and we plan to measure our success in years and decades etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the longterm health of our ecosystem our ecosystem consists of etsy and the people and communities around the world who benefit from our platform 

we value craftsmanship in all we make  craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion we are an engineeringdriven company and we think of our code as craft we are makers of the products and services that members of our community use and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do etsy sellers 

we believe fun should be part of everything we do  our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment and purpose is a key element of success we believe that this way of working is connected and joyful 

we keep it real always  we have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful when we believe that we are not being true to our values or our mission we are not afraid to change course 

impact strategy 

etsy’s impact strategy focuses on leveraging etsy’s core business to generate value for our community and stakeholders through positive economic social and environmental effortswe believe that aligning our impact strategy with our core business will lead to positive outcomes we aim to create more economic opportunity for sellers greater diversity in our workforce and build longterm resilience by reducing our carbon footprint we believe that consumers are demanding more of the businesses they support and that the companies best positioned to succeed will build winwin solutions that are good for people the planet and profitthe alignment of our mission values and impact strategy alongside our business strategy is critical to growing sustainably and positioning us for continued success 

for 2018 we have set key performance indicators “kpis” in order to measure our impact progress 

our team 

we pride ourselves on our actionoriented valuesbased and purposedriven work culture etsy’s employees work hard to bring innovative ideas and energy every day to strengthen the experience for sellers and buyers on etsycom as of december 31 2017  we had 744  employees worldwide with 452  employees located in our headquarters in brooklyn new york of those employees we had 237  in engineering 97  in product 161  in member operations 102  in marketing and 147  in facilities it and other corporate teams 

we focus on maximizing our employees’ engagement and their professional and personal wellbeing 

we believe employee engagement comes from fulfilling work focused on serving the needs of our sellers and buyers and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities we invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching skills workshops and training we also offer our employees paid time off to volunteer so that they can support the causes and organizations they are passionate about in 2016 we introduced a 26week genderblind parental leave policy that is available to all etsy employees globally through this policy we aim to support and enable parents to play equal roles in building successful companies and nurturing their families 

etsy engineering is widely known for its thoughtleading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture our engineering team coined the phrase “code as craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship we believe our engineers have the skills practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings 

we believe that a diverse workforce makes us a better company and we strive to create opportunities for underrepresented groups to join thrive and advance at etsy as part of our impact strategy we have implemented new recruiting guidelines that are intended improve diversity at all levels of our company as of december 31 2017  55  of employees identified as women as of december 31 2017  60  of managers and 38  of product engineering and technical operations employees identified as women we are committed to improving the diversity within our workforce and we publish an annual report that details our progress toward this goal 

competition 

we compete for etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software to small businesses an etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform we are able to compete for etsy sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our marketplace and the breadth of our online presence the number and engagement of etsy buyers our seller services our seller education resources and tools our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for etsy buyers based on the unique goods that etsy sellers list in our marketplace our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience our reputation as a trusted marketplace our mobile apps ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws primarily including trade secret copyright and trademark laws and to a lesser extent patent laws in the united states and abroad and we use confidentiality procedures defensive licensing nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect etsy and our intellectual property 

while we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property we file patents and register domain names trademarks copyrights and service marks in the united states and abroad we also rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example us federal and state laws eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws

we generated net income of 818 million  and incurred net losses of 299 million  and 541 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively as of december 31 2017  we had an accumulated deficit  of 963 million  a significant portion of our net income in the year ended december 31 2017  was due to an income tax benefit from the impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and a foreign currency gain on our intercompany debt we may not have the benefit of such gains and may not be profitable in future periods in addition our costs may increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform including our seller services and tools and technological enhancements and potentially increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and hire additional employees these efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses in addition our revenue may decline for a number of reasons including those described elsewhere in these risk factors 

further our revenue growth rate may continue to decelerate in the future for a number of reasons including the deceleration of our gms growth rate for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “ managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue ” you should not rely on growth rates of prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

in addition we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

if we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy or if our strategy proves to be ineffective our business financial performance and growth could be adversely affected 

  

in 2017 we introduced a new business strategy our ability to execute our strategy is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain the increased pace of product experiments coupled with the success of such initiatives and introduce offerings that meet the changing needs of our sellers and buyers and the ability of our employees to perform at a highlevel in addition the headcount reductions and the voluntary attrition we experienced in 2017 may make it more difficult for us to effectively implement our strategy if we are unable to execute our strategy if our strategy does not drive the growth that we anticipate or if our market opportunity is not as large as we have estimated it could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our business financial performance and growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active sellers and active buyers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers and seller engagement as well as the number of active buyers and buyer engagement we must continue to encourage etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our seller services we must also encourage buyers to return to etsy and purchase items in our marketplace more frequently 

we believe that many new etsy sellers and etsy buyers find etsycom by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers if existing etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform they may stop listing items in our marketplace and using our seller services and may stop referring others to us likewise if existing etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by etsy sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us under any of these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new etsy sellers and etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense 

even if we are able to attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers to replace the ones that we lose they may not maintain the same level of activity and the revenue generated from new etsy sellers and etsy buyers may not be as high as the revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplace if we are unable to retain existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers and attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers who contribute to an active community our business financial performance and growth would be harmed 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures if demand for the goods that etsy sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain etsy buyers and our business would be harmed trends in sociallyconscious consumerism and buying unique rather than mass produced goods could also shift or slow which would make it more difficult to attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers our growth would also be harmed if the shift to ecommerce does not continue 

our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success 

our ability to attract retain and motivate employees including our management team is important to our success we strive to attract retain and motivate employees from our office administrators to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “keep commerce human” we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the employees we need to maintain our competitive position 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

 in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief technology officer or unsuccessful succession planning in the future could adversely affect our business other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

in the second quarter of 2017 we experienced a number of changes to our senior management team and effected headcount reductions globally these changes may have impacted employee morale and led and may continue to lead to higher rates of voluntary attrition compared to prior years if we are unable to retain and attract qualified employees particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed 

filling engineering product management and other technical positions in the new york city area is particularly challenging qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success if we are unable to maintain them our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could suffer 

we have built a trusted marketplace that embodies our valuesbased culture and continue to focus on ensuring that we deliver trust and reliability throughout the buyer experience on etsycom our reputation depends upon our etsy sellers their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 if we are unable to maintain a trustworthy marketplace and encourage connections among members of our community then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep pace with technological changes and enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers our business financial performance and growth may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands and we are not able to predict the effect of these changes on our business the technologies that we currently use to support our platform may become inadequate or obsolete and the cost of incorporating new technologies into our products and services may be substantial we strive to respond to evolving customer needs and regularly launch new products features and services and since may 2017 have significantly increased the pace of product experiments etsy sellers and etsy buyers however may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs additionally as we experiment with new offerings or changes to our platform etsy sellers and etsy buyers may find these changes to be disruptive and may perceive them negatively in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for public launch is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive increases in revenue may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy etsy sellers and etsy buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing them which could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and seller services and tools is important to our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers one of our key initiatives is to build worldclass marketing capabilities to amplify the voice and relevance of our sellers and to get buyers to purchase more often generating a meaningful return on our investments in marketing initiatives may be difficult 

the marketing efforts we implement may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans external factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives our marketing efforts currently include search engine optimization search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as social media mobile push notifications and email we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google bing and yahoo search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s 

search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and therefore reduce the number of visits to our marketplace the growing use of online adblocking software including on mobile devices may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more etsy buyers to our platform in addition ongoing privacy regulatory changes may impact the scope and effectiveness of marketing and advertising services generally including those used on our platform 

we also obtain a significant number of visits through email if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to etsy sellers and etsy buyers or if etsy sellers and etsy buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected we are in the midst of a migration to a new customer relationship management “crm” system that we believe will enable more personalized dynamic and timely email communications and push notifications if the crm migration fails to achieve the expected results our business could be adversely affected social networking websites such as facebook and pinterest are another important source of visits to our marketplace as ecommerce and social networking evolve we must continue to evolve our marketing tactics accordingly and if we are unable to do so our business could be adversely affected 

we have experienced a number of changes to our senior management team if we are unable to effectively transition and integrate our new executive officers and implement our business strategy our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer joined etsy in may 2017 and in july 2017 we hired a new chief technology officer in light of these and other changes several members of our senior management team are relatively new to etsy the execution of our business strategy and our financial performance will depend in significant part on our senior management team and key team leaders if there is any failure or delay in transitioning or integrating our new management team if they are unable to execute our business strategy and four key initiatives or if our business strategy and four key initiatives prove to be ineffective then our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted 

if the mobile solutions available to etsy sellers and etsy buyers are not effective the use of our marketplace could decline 

purchases made on mobile devices by consumers including etsy buyers have increased significantly in recent years the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices etsy sellers’ ability to manage and scale their businesses may be harmed and consequently our business may suffer further although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both etsy sellers and etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device we depend on etsy sellers and etsy buyers using our mobile apps for the optimal mobile experience visits to our marketplace through a mobile website may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through our mobile app or through desktop which could result in less revenue for us additionally conversion rates may slow or stall which could also have a negative impact on gms and revenue 

as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them in addition supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources 

the success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as 

 

 

 

 if etsy sellers and etsy buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices our business financial performance and growth may be adversely affected 

expanding our community outside of the united states is part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

our vision is both global and local and we are focused on growing our business outside of the united states   although we have a significant number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers outside of the united states we have limited experience developing local markets outside the united states and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform to local markets 

despite our execution efforts the goods that etsy sellers list on etsycom may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy brand as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to etsycom from etsy buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that a most of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in us dollars 

our ability to grow our international operations may also be adversely affected by any circumstances that reduce or hinder crossborder trade for example the shipping of goods crossborder is typically more expensive and slower than domestic shipping and often involves complex customs and duty inspections and the dependency of national postal carrier systems 

our success outside the united states depends upon our ability to attract etsy sellers and etsy buyers from the same countries in order to enable the growth of local markets if we are not able to expand outside of the united states successfully our growth prospects could be harmed an inability to develop etsys community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states on a costeffective basis could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand our operations local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

continued expansion outside of the united states may also require significant financial investment these investments are expected to include seller and buyer acquisition marketing enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if etsy sellers are not our business could be adversely affected 

if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the united states and cannot manage these risks effectively the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets 

our payments system depends on thirdparty providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations 

etsy buyers primarily pay for purchases using etsy payments or paypal in the united states and other countries where etsy payments is available etsy payments enables our sellers to accept various forms of payments such as credit cards debit cards paypal google wallet apple pay and etsy gift cards etsy payments is our largest seller services revenue stream and nearly all sellers in the 36  countries where etsy payments is available are required to use the service 

we rely on thirdparty service providers to perform underlying compliance credit card processing and payment disbursing currency exchange identity verification and fraud analysis services if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate etsy sellers’ ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed for example thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that impact etsy in july 2016 a thirdparty payment processor experienced a technical issue that caused payment processing delays and complications for purchases through etsy payments which required etsy to develop a shortterm manual solution if a thirdparty payment processor has significant outages in the future and we do not have alternative payment processors in place or are unable to provide our own solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses could increase if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to etsy sellers some etsy sellers may stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether 

the laws and regulations related to payments are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources could result in liabilities or could force us to stop offering etsy payments additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments system less profitable for example any significant change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations may negatively impact etsy payments 

 as we expand the availability of etsy payments or offer new payment methods to etsy sellers and etsy buyers in the future we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payment processors we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard which are subject to change failure to comply with these rules and certification requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules could lead to increased fees for etsy or etsy sellers which may negatively impact etsy payments usage and our marketplace 

if sensitive information about members of our community is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are subject to cyber attacks members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services our platform is vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of our members personal or financial information cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property as we gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we rely on a variety of security measures including security testing encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists in addition we may and have in the past experienced security breaches as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional inadvertent or social engineering breaches occurring through our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers 

we are also reliant on the security practices of our third party service providers which may be outside of our direct control additionally some of our third party service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive member data if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or experience a breach of their networks our members data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face potential liability regulatory investigation costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining a trusted marketplace 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

the actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business specifically responding to common actions of an activist stockholder such as requests for special meetings potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming or divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company which may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

adherence to our values and our focus on our mission and longterm sustainability may negatively influence our short or mediumterm financial performance 

our values are integral to everything we do accordingly we intend to focus on the longterm sustainability of our business and work toward our mission to “keep commerce human” we may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and therefore our stockholders over a longer period of time even if those actions do not maximize short or mediumterm financial performance however these longerterm benefits may not materialize within the time frame we expect or at all for example 

 until recently we were a certified b corporation the term “certified b corporation” does not refer to a particular form of legal entity but instead refers to companies that are certified by b lab an independent nonprofit organization as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance accountability and transparency in 2017 we relinquished our certified b corporation status when we chose not to convert from a c corporation to a public benefit corporation under delaware law one of b lab’s requirements for continued certification if this change in status creates a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by certified b corporations our reputation could be harmed similarly our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with our values 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns natural disasters public health crises political crises or other unexpected events 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available in our platform may be reduced this would cause sales in our marketplace and seller services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business conversely if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplace could decline in addition currency exchange rates may impact our business for example currency exchange rates may dampen demand from buyers outside the united states for goods denominated in us dollars which could impact gms for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 85  of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political crises such as terrorist attacks war and other political instability or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers for example when hurricane sandy struck new york in october 2012 our headquarters in brooklyn was closed for five days in addition hurricanes and other natural disasters are likely to impact buyer behavior for discretionary goods and sellers’ ability to run their businesses on our marketplace these events may also impact consumer perceptions of wellbeing and security which may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending if any of these events occurs our business could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform such as square bigcommerce and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy sellers based on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba or national retail chains such as west elm or target or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for etsy sellers to match 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy buyers based on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do 

they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do further our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services causing etsy sellers and etsy buyers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services additionally we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to etsy buyers 

a small portion of etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform for example etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by an etsy seller or that an etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions 

negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers or damage our reputation a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to etsy buyers could harm etsy sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of etsy sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of etsy sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of etsy buyers which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by etsy sellers or other members of our community our policies promote legal and ethical business practices such as encouraging etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions however we do not control etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

failure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business 

although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our marketplace those measures may not always be effective 

for example etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data under current credit card practices we could be held liable for orders placed through etsy payments with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent 

transactions we may not be able to do so effectively as a result our business could be adversely affected we could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or payment card association rules or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace 

negative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers and damage our reputation 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in 2015 rules approved by the federal communications commission “fcc” went into effect that prohibited internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain “fast traffic” lanes however in december 2017 the fcc voted to repeal those rules this repeal may make it more difficult or costly for many small businesses such as our community of sellers as well as our buyers to access our platform and may result in increased costs for us which could significantly harm our business and the millions of microbusinesses that utilize our platform we along with other companies and public interest groups intend to challenge this repeal in the courts but these efforts may not be successful and may be costly outside of the united states government regulation of the internet including data localization requirements limitation on marketplace scope or ownership intellectual property intermediary liability rules regulation of online speech limits on network neutrality and rules related to security privacy or national security may impede etsy and our users as a result we could face regulatory challenges or discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and etsy sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform 

the reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as the number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers volume of traffic number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow the operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex and we could experience operational failures if we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability the investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our business and to improve our operating results in the long term but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce profitability in the near term 

we also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet cloud and mobile infrastructure and increasingly rely on the availability features cost and reliability of thirdparty service providers and platforms for example this includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products 

thirdparty providers host much of our technology infrastructure and are likely to host more in the future any disruption in their services or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide such as security concerns our efforts to update our infrastructure may not be successful or may take longer than anticipated if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be adversely affected which could harm our growth prospects and our business 

we will rely on google cloud for a substantial portion of our computing storage data processing networking and other services any disruption of or interference with our use of the google cloud operation would adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

google cloud platform provides a distributed computing infrastructure as a service platform for business operations and we are in the process of migrating our data centers to google cloud increasing our reliance on cloud infrastructure as we implement the transition to the cloud there may be an increased risk of downtime for our website and site delays and we may also need to divert engineering resources away from other important business operations which could significantly harm our business and growth additionally if the costs to migrate to google cloud are greater than we expect or take significantly more time than we anticipate our business could be harmed 

any transition of the cloud services currently provided by google cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense any significant disruption of or interference with our use of google cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed in addition if hosting costs increase over time and if we require more computing or storage capacity our costs could increase disproportionately if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of google or similar providers our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and laws and regulations focused on internet service providers and online commerce such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability intellectual property and consumer protection in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws in some cases nonus privacy data security consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more detailed than those in the united states and in some countries are actively enforced 

these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by internet service providers or online commerce for example laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements relating to the use of thirdparty “cookies” “web beacons” and other methods of online tracking the united states the european union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could i significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools and ii require internet service providers to disclose user information to regulatory authorities 

some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of etsy buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business could be adversely affected 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments could impede the growth of internet service providers or online commerce it is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business furthermore the circumstances in which we may be held liable for the acts omissions or responsibilities of our sellers is uncertain complex and evolving for example certain laws have recently been enacted seeking to hold marketplaces like ours responsible for certain compliance obligations for which sellers have traditionally been responsible if an increasing number of such laws are passed the resulting compliance costs could negatively impact our business 

regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business 

in addition to the actual and potential changes in law described elsewhere in these risk factors compliance with privacy and data security regulations particularly outside the united states is likely to require changes to the ways we collect use and share personal information and necessitate specific product changes for our nonus activities for example the eu has undertaken a major overhaul to its privacy law that could significantly affect our business in may of 2018 the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” will go into effect effectively extending the scope of eu data protection law to all noneu companies processing data of eu residents the gdpr is intended to harmonize the data protection regulations throughout the entire eu the regulation contains numerous requirements and changes from existing eu law including more robust obligations on data processors greater rights for data subjects requiring potentially significant changes to both our technology and operations and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs specifically the gdpr will introduce numerous privacyrelated changes for companies operating in the eu including greater control over personal data by data subjects eg the “right to be forgotten” increased data portability for eu consumers data breach notification requirements and increased fines in particular under the gdpr fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company whichever is greater could be imposed for violations of certain of the gdpr’s requirements the gdpr requirements apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including user and employee information 

the evolving data protection landscape in the eu could result in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by data protection authorities other public authorities or individuals we may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new european sellers or new sellers selling into europe due to the legal requirements compliance cost potential risk exposure and uncertainty for them in respect of their own compliance obligations with respect to gdpr 

in addition the laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside of the eu continue to evolve and remain uncertain   although we are taking steps to comply and mitigate the potential impact to us the efficacy and longevity of these steps are uncertain we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain personal data originating from the eu in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business in the meantime there could be uncertainty as to how to comply with eu privacy law further despite our ongoing efforts to bring practices into compliance before the effective date of the gdpr we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control such as limited internal resource allocation or outside our control such as a lack of vendor cooperation it’s also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the gdpr leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various eu states 

we may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit infringing or illegal 

although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by etsy sellers we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplace and in certain cases closing the shops of etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability in particular we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by etsy sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where laws may offer less protection for intermediaries and platforms than the united states under current us copyright law and the communications decency act we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on our platform by etsy sellers and etsy buyers however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions these safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably in that event we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of etsy sellers 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by etsy sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platform less userfriendly moreover public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly interconnected and complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform which can impact the user experience on etsycom additionally due to the interconnected nature of the software underlying our platform updates to certain parts of our code including changes to etsy or third party apis on which etsy relies could have an unintended impact on other sections of our code which may result in errors or vulnerabilities to our platform any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which are extremely costly to defend could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims thirdparties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings third parties may also allege a company is secondarily liable for intellectual property infringement or that it is a joint infringer with another party any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters in addition some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors and patent holding companies have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where etsy does business we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including class action lawsuits for example as described further in “ note 15—commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters in connection with the litigation described in this annual  report and in connection with any future lawsuits any lawsuit to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and to a lesser extent patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property to the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software 

the software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by etsy and the internet and technology industries have been interpreted by only a few court decisions and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

our business and our etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial taxes goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to businesses like ours and to etsy sellers and etsy buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to etsy sellers’ businesses if etsy is found to be deficient in how it has addressed its tax obligations our business could be adversely impacted 

one or more states the federal government or other countries are seeking to impose additional reporting recordkeeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce if these new requirements become applicable our business could be harmed for example taxing authorities in certain us states and in other countries have identified ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and are considering related legislation new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on etsy causes our marketplace to be less attractive to current and prospective etsy buyers additionally new legislation could require us or etsy sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling in our marketplace less attractive 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and in numerous other jurisdictions we record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we could be subject to higher than anticipated tax liabilities as well as ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as audits close and exposures are reevaluated further our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

the us government recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities these changes include among others 1 a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate 2 a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense 3 a shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a quasiterritorial system along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the us income tax base and 4 a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets with the latter taxed at a lower rate notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in january 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states our new corporate structure changed how we use our intellectual property and implemented certain intercompany arrangements we believe this may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate over the long term and other operational efficiencies however the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure moreover these tax laws are subject to change tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences if our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected 

the growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business in the number of etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have etsy sellers and etsy buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future both in the united states and abroad the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future acquisitions may divert management’s time and focus from operating our business acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 



moreover we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect or in the time frame we expect we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

if our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business 

our insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities such as general liability property coverage errors and omissions liability employment liability business interruptions data breaches crime product liability and directors’ and officers’ liability for certain types of business risk we may not be able to or may choose not to acquire insurance in addition we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums andor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain additionally if any of our insurers becomes insolvent it would be unable to pay any claims that we make 

operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention in addition our management team has limited experience managing a public company 

as a public company we incur substantial legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “the sarbanesoxley act” and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market “nasdaq” also apply to us as part of these requirements we have established and maintained effective disclosure and financial controls and made changes to our corporate governance practices we expect that continued compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming in addition as a public company we may be subject to stockholder activism which can lead to additional substantial costs distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate 

many on our management team and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings in addition our management and other personnel divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company in particular we have incurred significant expense and devoted substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we may need to continue to invest in additional accounting financial and legal resources to ensure that we continue to meet our public company requirements 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2017  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations or nasdaq listing requirements adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

the terms of any future debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have a credit facility or other debt instrument in place however we may choose to enter into certain debt instruments in the future which could require us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies moreover if we were to default under any debt instrument such default could limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under a credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders any debt financing that we may secure in the future could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for example since january 1 2016 our common stocks daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 636 to a high of 2176 through february 23 2018  the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial performance or growth stock prices of many internet and technology companies have historically been highly volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation for example as described further in “ note 15—commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

if analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our common stock would likely decline if few analysts cover us demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be restricted by the terms of future financings as a result stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

the timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties 

in november 2017 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a number of factors including our stock price trading volume regulatory requirements and general market conditions along with our working capital requirements general business conditions legal restrictions and other factors the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility the existence of our stock repurchase program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares in addition there is no guarantee that our stock repurchase plan will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of recent and future employee stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting further any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” may delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 of the dgcl imposes certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other 

transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services and tools we provide to etsy sellers to help them start manage and scale their businesses marketplace revenue is comprised of a 35 transaction fee an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and a 020 listing fee that she pays for each item she lists for up to four months on etsycom seller services revenue is comprised of the fees an etsy seller pays us for our four paid seller services etsy payments formerly called direct checkout our payment processing service promoted listings our onsite advertising service that allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results shipping labels which allows sellers in the united states and canada to purchase discounted shipping labels and pattern by etsy a service that allows sellers to build custom websites we generate additional revenue through our commercial partnerships 

our strategy is focused on growing our etsycom marketplace in our core geographies and owning special purchase occasions – style gifting and celebrations – throughout the year we believe that buyers shop for special occasions many times throughout the year so our goal is to have them think of etsy more often and return of our marketplace more frequently 

we aim to empower our passionate community of 19 million  etsy sellers to compete and win against mass retailers for special shopping occasions we believe that we can achieve these goals by executing on our four key initiatives 



year highlights 

in the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded revenue of 4412 million  driven by growth in both marketplace and seller services revenue net income  of 818 million  and nongaap adjusted ebitda of 800 million  see “— nongaap financial measures ” for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

as of december 31 2017  our marketplace connected 19 million  active etsy sellers and 334 million  active etsy buyers in nearly every country in the world in the year ended december 31 2017  etsy sellers generated gms of 33 billion  of which approximately 51  came from purchases made on mobile devices we are a global company and 33  of our gms in the year ended december 31 2017  came from transactions where either an etsy seller or an etsy buyer was located outside of the united states 

during the year we launched the following new features and tools focused on our four key initiatives 

 

 

 as part of the restructuring plan approved by our board of directors in the second quarter of 2017 the “actions” we closed the a little market “alm” platform the alm office in paris france and our office in melbourne australia in 2017 as a result of the actions we have identified approximately 20 million  in 2017 expense reductions which are expected to result in approximately 35 million  in annualized cost savings these savings are being realized through a combination of headcount reductions and reduced thirdparty expenses and programming costs during the year ended december 31 2017  we recognized restructuring and other exit costs of 139 million  please refer to “ note 3—restructuring and other exit costs ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail about the actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings including etsy studio our craft supplies marketplace launched in april 2017 and etsy manufacturing our offering to connect etsy sellers with production partners which resulted in the recognition of a 32 million  impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internaluse software assets down to zero this decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the etsycom marketplace 

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 we began working on an initiative to migrate our data centers to the cloud which we believe will help accelerate our search and machine learning capabilities and enhance our infrastructure we expect this initiative to last approximately two years while this initiative is underway we will be incurring implementation costs and costs associated with maintaining our current data center infrastructure our current data center infrastructure is supported by capital expenditures which are amortized over three years whereas costs associated with the operation of the cloud infrastructure will be expensed as incurred in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operations we expect to spend approximately 10 million to 15 million  in 2018 on the migration while reducing capital expenditures related to the maintenance of our existing data center infrastructure by 4 million to 5 million  compared with 2017 once we have fully migrated to the cloud we expect our total cash costs will decrease compared to our standalone data center infrastructure 

key operating and financial metrics   

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our ecosystem allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments and assess the performance of our business the unaudited nongaap financial measure and key operating and financial metrics we use are 



gms 

gross merchandise sales “gms” is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by etsy gms is driven by transactions in our marketplace and is not directly impacted by seller services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of etsy sellers the satisfaction of etsy buyers the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net income loss  adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  provision benefit for income taxes  foreign exchange gain loss  asset impairment charges  acquisitionrelated expenses  restructuring and other exit costs related to the actions contributions to good work institute formerly etsyorg  interest and other nonoperating expense net  and net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for more information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda including its limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is an etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include transaction fees listing fees and fees for etsy payments promoted listings shipping labels pattern and google shopping an etsy seller is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy seller accounts we succeed when etsy sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our ecosystem 

active buyers 

an active buyer is an etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months an etsy buyer is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy buyer accounts we generate revenue when etsy buyers order items from etsy sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of etsy buyers and the health of our ecosystem 

mobile visits 

a visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app a visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity a mobile visit is a visit that occurs on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone etsy sellers are increasingly using mobile devices to manage their listings and track their business performance on our platform in addition etsy buyers increasingly use mobile devices to search browse and purchase items on our platform we view percent mobile visits as a key indicator of the level of engagement of etsy sellers and etsy buyers on our mobile website and mobile apps and of our ability to sustain gms and revenue 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes alm and etsy wholesale and orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop when calculating percent mobile gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the etsy seller or the shipping address for the etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states when calculating percent international gms we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

nongaap financial measures   

adjusted ebitda 

in this annual report on form 10k we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net income loss  adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  provision benefit for income taxes  foreign exchange gain loss  asset impairment charges  acquisitionrelated expenses  restructuring and other exit costs related to the actions contributions to good work institute formerly etsyorg  interest and other nonoperating expense net  and net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities  below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform 

we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges 

adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 



 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income loss  and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income loss  to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 



1 included in interest and depreciation expense amounts above are interest and depreciation expense related to our new headquarters under buildtosuit accounting requirements which commenced in may 2016 for the year s ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  those amounts are as follows 



2 27 million  of restructuringrelated stockbased compensation expense has been excluded from the year ended december 31 2017  and is included in the restructuring and other exit costs line see footnote 3 below total stockbased compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows 



 

 consolidated statement of operations line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs 

in the second quarter of 2017 the board of directors approved plans to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure and improve focus on key strategic growth opportunities the “actions” in this annual report we discuss certain financial statement line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs each nongaap financial measure that represents the income statement line item adjusted to exclude restructuring and other exit costs incurred in the year ended december 31 2017  

we have included these financial statement line items excluding restructuring and other exit costs because the actions were unusual and do not necessarily reflect the ongoing trends in these financial statement line items we believe that these nongaap measures can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of the actions 

these nongaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 because of these limitations you should consider these nongaap measures alongside other financial performance measures including the gaap financial statement line items

the following table reflects the reconciliation of each affected gaap line item of the consolidated statement of operations to the nongaap line item excluding restructuring and other exit costs for each of the periods indicated 



key factors affecting our performance   

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed in the section titled “ risk factors ” 

growth and retention of active sellers and active buyers   

our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active sellers and active buyers our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers seller engagement the number of active buyers buyer engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace as of december 31 2017  our marketplace had grown to 19 million  active sellers and 334 million  active buyers up from 17 million  active sellers and 286 million  active buyers as of december 31 2016  we believe two of our most significant opportunities to drive growth within our marketplace are to bring new buyers to etsy and to encourage existing buyers to return more frequently repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of etsy buyers in 2017  approximately 396  of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months down from 410  in 2016  we aim to increase repeat purchases by building trust in the etsy brand and removing friction from the buying experience to improve conversion rates on the platform 

to analyze our retention rates we measure repeat activity by active sellers sellers who have incurred at least one charge from us in the past 12 months and active buyers buyers who have made at least one purchase through etsy in the last 12 months 

cohort of 2014 2013 2012 and 2011 active sellers

these cohort data demonstrate our success in retaining sellers over a multiyear period with the sellers that remain on our platform maintaining consistent gms growth

we refer to active buyers as of december 31 2014 as “2014 active buyers” as of december 31 2013 as “2013 active buyers” as of december 31 2012 as “2012 active buyers” and as of december 31 2011 as “2011 active buyers” of total 2014 active buyers 387  remained active buyers through their fourth year on the platform compared to 411  for 2013 active buyers 425  for 2012 active buyers and 447  for 2011 active buyers the average annual gms per 2014 active buyer during their fourth year on the platform was 70  higher than their first year compared to 81  for 2013 active buyers 88  for 2012 active buyers and 89  for 2011 active buyers we note that 2013 was the first year we started to significantly invest in our paid acquisition marketing efforts to grow our buyer base 



these cohort data demonstrate our ability to consistently retain buyers over a multiyear period and reflects the loyalty of our buyer base we have identified our ability to increase purchase frequency among these longterm buyers as one of our significant opportunities for growth and we are focused on improving search and recommendations to better match our buyers with the 50 million  items listed on etsycom driving buyer growth and retention

sellers using pattern additionally in 2017  approximately 85  of gms was processed through etsy payments compared to 78  in 2016  primarily due to the transition of nearly all sellers in eligible countries to etsy payments 

investment in marketing 

we are focusing on initiatives to shape perceptions of our marketplace as the goto shopping destination for special purchase occasions by investing primarily in digital acquisition and other marketing initiatives and in our team to support marketing activities within digital acquisition marketing we align our investments in accordance with our lifetime value model which is a prediction of the gms attributed to each buyer over a twoyear time frame and make conservative assumptions about how paid traffic will perform compared with organic traffic we remain committed to achieving positive return on investment at the aggregate company level on our marketing spend and maintaining a marketing payback period that continues to satisfy our lifetime value model over time we believe this will help us attract new buyers and also encourage existing buyers to make more frequent purchases in 2017  we spent 1091 million  on marketing expenses or 247  of revenue up   326  over 2016  in 2016  we spent 822 million  on marketing expenses or 225  of revenue up   232  over 2015

seller services revenue increased   576 million  or 287  to  2585 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the growth  in seller services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from etsy payments up 316 largely driven by overall gms growth trends and increased seller adoption the share of gms processed through our etsy payments platform was 85  for the year ended december 31 2017  up from 78  in the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to the transition of nearly all sellers in eligible countries to the platform seller services revenue also benefited from the growth in revenue from promoted listings up 250 and to a lesser extent shipping labels up 167 and pattern up 848 the increase in promoted listings revenue was due to higher click volume and overall product enhancements the increase in shipping label revenue reflects a combination of an increase in label volume up 124 and an increase in average margin per label up 43 the increase in pattern revenue was primarily due to the incremental monthly paid subscription periods in 2017  as the product launched in april 2016 with the first paid subscriptions beginning in may 2016 seller services revenue continued to outpace growth in marketplace revenue during 2017 as of december 31 2017  543  of active sellers use one or more of our seller services compared to 517  of active sellers as of december 31 2016  at december 31 2017  499  of active sellers used etsy payments 150  of active sellers used promoted listings 281  of active sellers in the united states and canada used shipping labels and 25  of active sellers used pattern in 2018 we expect seller services revenue to grow at a faster pace than marketplace revenue as we add enhancements and features to our portfolio of services and increase our efforts to grow seller adoption 

other revenue decreased   26 million  or 444  to  33 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  mainly due to a decrease in revenue from accumulated unused gift card funds received from our thirdparty service provider down 734 in the year ended december 31 2016  we recognized 17 million in revenue from accumulated unused gift cards which represented the threeyear cumulative value of gift cards that the thirdparty service provider has concluded are not likely to be redeemed in 2017 unused gift card revenue was recognized monthly as earned and is not anticipated to be significant in future periods in addition processing fees from paypal a thirdparty payment processor decreased 302 as a result of the transition of nearly all sellers in eligible countries to etsy payments in 2017

other income net  was  204 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to 291 million  foreign currency gain mainly the result of the significant change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on intercompany debt and other nonfunctional currency balances partially offset by 111 million  of interest expense largely associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting for our new corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2017 we established a new legal entity based in ireland with a us dollar functional currency to help mitigate the currency rate risk on our intercompany debt 

other expense net  was 205 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of 150 million  of currency exchange loss mainly the result of the significant change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on intercompany debt and other nonfunctional currency balances and 72 million  of interest expense largely associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting for our new corporate headquarters 

benefit provision for income taxes   

  



our income tax benefit  and provision  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  was 495 million  and 270 million  respectively 

  

the primary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was the impact on deferred taxes from the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law which among other items reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result our deferred taxes and certain unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 have been revalued at the reduced 21 rate the revaluation resulted in a benefit for income taxes of approximately 311 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

the secondary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was the recognition of excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this updated guidance we recorded 128 million  of excess tax benefits rather than additional paidin capital for the year ended december 31 2017  

the primary driver of the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016 was tax expense related to our updated corporate structure of 171 million 

for both periods other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

comparison of years ended december 31   2016   and 2015

for the year ended december 31 2016  international gms was 30  of total gms flat compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the percent international gms was largely driven by gms growth between us buyers and international sellers and gms growth between buyers and sellers outside of the us both in the same country and crossborder gms growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remains the fastest growing category of international gms gms between international buyers and sellers in the same country grew approximately 47 yearoveryear during the year ended december 31 2016  we believe the growth in this gms category demonstrates the progress we are making on our strategy to build and deepen local etsy communities in our key international markets 

revenue increased   915 million  or 334  to 3650 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  of which 550  consisted of seller services revenue and 433  consisted of marketplace revenue

seller services revenue increased 642 million  or 470  to 2009 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the growth in seller services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from etsy payments which continued to benefit from the integration of paypal through the anniversary of this integration at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 seller services revenue also benefited from the growth in revenue from promoted listings and shipping labels and to a lesser extent a modest contribution from pattern the increase in promoted listings revenue was due to higher click volume and overall product enhancements the increase in shipping label revenue reflects a combination of an increase in label volume and an increase in average margin per label seller services revenue continued to outpace growth in marketplace revenue during 2016  as of december 31 2016  517 of active sellers use one or more of our seller services compared to 481 of active sellers as of december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  455 of active sellers used etsy payments 159 of active sellers used promoted listings 263 of active sellers in the united states and canada used shipping labels and 25 of active sellers used pattern 

other revenue increased   17 million  or 392  to 59 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  mainly due to the recognition of 17 million in revenue from accumulated unused gift card funds received from our thirdparty service provider this represents the threeyear cumulative value of gift cards that the thirdparty service provider has concluded are not likely to be redeemed this increase was partially offset by a reduction of processing fees from paypal a thirdparty payment processor as a result of its integration into etsy payments

cost of revenue increased   263 million  or 272  to 1233 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of additional costs to support the increase in etsy payments revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in employeerelated costs cost of revenue decreased  as a percentage of revenue due to the leverage we achieved in costs related to our technology infrastructure and employeerelated costs

marketing 

  



marketing expenses increased   155 million  or 232  to 822 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of increased spend on brand marketing campaigns and affiliate marketing related to buyer acquisition and an increase in employeerelated expenses in our marketing team 

product development 

  



product development expenses increased   124 million  or 290  to 551 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in employeerelated expenses in our product and engineering teams including additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of blackbird in september 2016 

general and administrative 

  



general and administrative expenses increased   172 million  or 250  to 862 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  primarily driven by an increase in employeerelated expenses overhead related to our new office locations including depreciation expense related to our new brooklyn headquarters and professional services mainly related to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act this increase was partially offset by a onetime contribution of 35 million  to good work institute formerly etsyorg during the first half of 2015 removing the impact of this contribution general and administrative expenses would have increased 317

other expense net   

  



other expense net  was 205 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of a currency exchange loss mainly the result of the significant change in us dollar to euro exchange rates on intercompany debt and other nonfunctional currency balances and interest expense largely associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting for our new corporate headquarters other expense net  was 261 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  mainly due to a foreign currency loss related to the intercompany debt and other nonfunctional currency balances and a marktomarket loss related to convertible warrants 

provision for income taxes   

  



our income tax provision  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  was 270 million  and 261 million  respectively for both periods the primary driver of the income tax provision was tax expense related to our updated corporate structure of 171 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

quarterly results of operations 

the following tables show selected unaudited quarterly results of operations and other unaudited operational and nongaap financial data for the eight quarters ended december 31 2017  and the percentage that each line item in the following results of operations data represents of revenue the results of operations data for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and includes all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of our results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our quarterly results of operations and operational and nongaap financial data will vary in the future these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future quarter or year 

  



 



  



  



the following table reflects the reconciliation of net income loss  to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 





seasonality 

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more seller services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2017  decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016  we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially  quartertoquarter for all periods presented above other than the first quarter of 2017  corresponding  to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

liquidity and capital resources   

the following tables show our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and net working capital as of the dates indicated 



as of december 31 2017  our cash and cash equivalents a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds were held for future investments working capital funding and general corporate purposes

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in “ — key factors affecting our performance ” above and in our “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates   

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition income taxes website development costs and internaluse software purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases stockbased compensation and restructuring and other exit costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services and tools we provide to etsy sellers to help them start manage and scale their businesses we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the etsy seller 3 the collection of fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the etsy seller is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we are the primary obligor in a transaction have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers among other factors 

marketplace revenue  marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of the 35  transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction exclusive of shipping fees charged and the listing fee of 020  she pays for each item she lists on etsycom transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made listing fees are recognized ratably over a four month listing period unless the item is sold or the seller relists it at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized 

seller services revenue  seller services revenue consists of fees an etsy seller pays us for our four paid services etsy payments promoted listings shipping labels and pattern 

 other revenue  other revenue includes the fees we receive from commercial partnerships which are recognized as earned in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 

website development and internaluse software costs 

costs incurred to develop our website and software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three  years in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed management has authorized and 

committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended we also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality costs related to the design or maintenance of website development and internaluse software are expensed as incurred we periodically review these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed placed in service removed from service or replaced by other internallydeveloped or thirdparty software if an asset is not expected to provide any future use the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed 

if an asset will continue to be used but the net book value is not expected to be fully recoverable the asset is impaired to its fair value when events or changes in circumstances require we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of website development and internaluse software costs based on its expectations of future profitability undiscounted cash flows and our plans with respect to operations to determine if the asset is impaired and subject to writeoff measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the fair value 

leases 

we lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under noncancelable lease agreements the leases are reviewed for classification as operating capital or buildtosuit leases for operating leases rent is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease period for capital leases we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability 

we consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newlyleased office space to determine if we are considered for accounting purposes only to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period if we determine that we are the owner of the construction project we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability “buildtosuit accounting” upon occupancy for buildtosuit leases we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the saleleaseback accounting guidance if the lease meets the saleleaseback criteria we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease if upon completion of construction the project does not meet the “saleleaseback” criteria the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes 

in may 2016 we took possession of our corporate headquarters in brooklyn upon substantial completion of the construction phase of the buildout upon completion of the project we performed a saleleaseback analysis pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” 840 —leases  to determine the appropriateness of removing the previously capitalized assets from the consolidated balance sheets we concluded that components of “continuing involvement” were evident as a result of this review precluding the derecognition of the related assets from the consolidated balance sheets in conjunction with the lease we also recorded a facility financing obligation equal to the fair market value of the assets received from the landlord at the end of the lease term including exercise of any renewal options the net remaining facility financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a noncash gain on sale of the property we do not report rent expense for the lease rather rental payments under the lease are recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and interest expense and the associated asset capitalized throughout the construction project is depreciated over its determined useful life 

income taxes 

we account for the income tax benefit provision based on income loss before income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement 

we recognize interest and penalties if any associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 

business combinations intangible assets and goodwill 

we have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future the results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash equity or a combination of the two in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies estimates of future revenues and cash flows discount rates and selection of comparable companies 

when we issue stockbased or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for postcombination services the evaluation includes among other things whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition date if continued employment is required for vesting the awards are treated as compensation for postcombination services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period 

we initially recognize intangible assets at fair value and we amortize them on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then additional impairment testing is not required however if we conclude otherwise we are then required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment 

the quantitative assessment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value including goodwill if the estimated fair value exceeds book value goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary if however the book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased compensation awards in accordance with acounting standards codification “asc” topic 718 compensation—stock compensation  stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” are awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and are measured at fair value at each grant date stock options generally vest over a four year period with 25  of the shares underlying the options vesting after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period subject to continued service with us through each vesting date rsus generally vest 25  after the first year following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12 quarter period contingent on continued employment with us on each vesting date 

stockbased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq on the grant date in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of guidance in asu 201609 compensation—stock compensation scope of modification accounting  in reporting periods prior to 2017 we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods as necessary if actual forfeitures differed from estimates we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

we account for stockbased compensation arrangements related to the alm acquisition in restricted shares subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash as liabilityclassified stock awards these awards are remeasured at each reporting period with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as 

though the award were in substance multiple awards unless the put option is exercised the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option in 2017 all outstanding restricted shares subject to a put option became fully vested and we will no longer be required to remeasure these awards at fair value going forward 

key assumptions 

our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

 in determining the fair value of stock options granted the following weighted average assumptions were used in the blackscholes optionpricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated

as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in cash deposits money market funds fixedincome funds and aarated us government and agency securities the fair value of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the shortterm nature of these instruments the majority of our current interest expense is attributable to our facility financing obligation related to our buildtosuit lease and is not impacted by external factors on interest rates a 10 increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense 

currency risk 

approximately 85  of our gms is denominated in us dollars and therefore the resulting revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however in the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 15  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and as a result was impacted by currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2017  would have been 143  or approximately 20 basis points   lower  than the reported 145  growth on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the three months ended december 31 2017  would have been 165  compared with the reported 178  growth in addition we believe weaker local currencies in certain international markets continued to dampen the demand for us dollardenominated goods during the year ended december 31 2017  impacting both gms growth and percent international gms 

in the year ended december 31 2016  88  of our gms was denominated in us dollars and approximately 12  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2016  would have been 200  or approximately one  percentage point higher than the reported 190  growth 

our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and pound sterling fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations a 10 increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in an increase or decrease to currency exchange loss gain of 216 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  this compares to a currency exchange loss gain of 412 million  based on the same analysis performed for the year ended december 31 2016  

on january 1 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states which resulted in a us dollardenominated intercompany debt on a eurodenominated ledger that was subject to continued currency exchange rate risk through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we established a new legal entity based in ireland with a us dollar functional currency to help mitigate the currency rate risk on our intercompany debt

values and impact 

at etsy values are not a nicetohave they’re an integral part of how we do business we work hard to ensure that our values guide our decision making and are integrated into every aspect of our business and operations our values help drive our business forward as a force for good and help us build the etsy economy 

we believe that a growing number of consumers consider the environmental and social impact of their purchases we also believe that consumers will demand more of the businesses they support and that the companies best positioned to succeed will build winwin solutions that are good for people the planet and profit as such we believe that values and impact alignment is critical to growing our business sustainably and positioning us for success in the future 

in 2016 we formed our values aligned business “vab” team whose mandate is to ensure that etsy’s mission values and impact goals are embedded in all aspects of our culture products services business and leadership the vab team is conducting a review process to ensure that our values continue to live up to these ideals we are committed to the spirit of our 

current values as we focus on ways to deepen our impact and continue to incorporate and build human connection in commerce act with courage serve our community be accountable and drive diversity and inclusion

we value craftsmanship in all we make  craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion we are an engineeringdriven company and we think of our code as craft we are makers of the products and services that members of our community use and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do etsy sellers 

we believe fun should be part of everything we do  our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment and purpose is a key element of success we believe that this way of working is connected and joyful

we are also dedicated to creating a net positive environmental social and economic impact through our business for example in 2016 we established our goal of running etsycom as a carbon neutral market we took steps toward this aspiration with the launch of etsy solar a program which helps our seller community in the united states go solar and creates carbon offsets for our etsycom market we also committed to power our offices and data centers with 100 renewable electricity by 2020 and currently have onsite solar at our brooklyn and hudson new york offices

 etsy buyers thoughtful consumers 

etsy buyers visit etsycom to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere with items ranging from a 5 ornament to a 50 handknit sweater to a 2000 custommade table   in a 2016  survey of etsycom buyers 91  agreed that etsy offers products they cannot find elsewhere we believe many etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience we believe they also value craftsmanship artistry uniqueness authenticity and sustainability in our markets etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with etsy sellers etsy buyers can also purchase customized items bespoke goods or unique and unexpected craft supplies from etsy sellers by buying in our markets etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world as of december 31 2016  there were 286 million  active buyers on our platform 

etsy employees 

we too are members of our community whether drafting our policies talking with etsy sellers and etsy buyers in our online forums enhancing search functionality to help buyers better find what theyre looking for or building new services and tools that help sellers start manage and scale their businesses our employees create genuine and lasting connections in our community etsy employees build personal relationships with etsy sellers by visiting their shops inviting them to our offices for lunch or celebrating with them at inperson events in addition our employees including management are encouraged to perform support rotations to foster connections with etsy sellers and etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs 

we pride ourselves on our valuesbased and purposedriven work culture we focus on maximizing our employees’ professional and personal wellbeing we evaluate employee performance on traditional business metrics and on adherence to our mission and values 

we believe employee engagement comes from fulfilling work focused on serving the needs of our sellers and buyers and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities we invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching skills workshops and training we actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employeetaught classes called “etsy school” covering subjects ranging from screen printing to python programming we also offer our employees paid time off to volunteer so that they can support the causes and organizations they are passionate about in 2016 we introduced a 26week genderblind parental leave policy that is available to all etsy employees globally through this policy we aim to support and enable parents to play equal roles in building successful companies and nurturing their families fortune magazine has recognized us as a great place to work every year since 2013 

etsy engineering is widely known for its thoughtleading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture our engineering team coined the phrase “code as craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of 

engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship we believe our engineers have the skills practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings 

as of december 31 2016  we had 1043 employees worldwide with 648  in our offices in brooklyn new york of those employees we had 319  in engineering 124  in product 187  in member operations 276  in corporate and 137  in marketing 

we believe that a diverse workforce makes us a better company and we strive to create opportunities for underrepresented groups to join thrive and advance at etsy for example we proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company as of december 31 2016  56  of employees identified as female as of december 31 2016  58  of managers and 36  of product engineering and technical operations employees identified as female we are committed to improving the diversity within our workforce and we publish an annual progress report that details our progress toward this goal 

our partners 

our community also includes retailers who participate in our etsy wholesale offering and production partners who assist etsy sellers who want to scale their businesses through our etsy manufacturing offering within etsy wholesale retailers nearly all of which are local boutiques use our platform to connect directly with etsy sellers and to add unique and distinctive items to their store offerings as of december 31 2016  there were 25000  retailers on the platform etsy manufacturing helps etsy sellers who want to grow their business and connect directly with production partners for example an etsy seller might work with a cutandsew shop to make clothes she has designed a casting house that casts wax models for her jewelry designs or a digital printer that prints her photographs on household items 

investors 

we consider investors important stakeholders in our business we strive to maintain transparent and open communications with the investment community as appropriate and appreciate those who support and believe in our longterm mission to reimagine commerce 

our opportunity 

we believe that the nature of commerce is changing people are choosing to purchase goods online or from a mobile device consumers are looking for unique items rather than mass produced goods and more people than ever are seeking employment outside of the traditional ninetofive workplace we believe that these trends create a strong longterm market opportunity for etsy allowing us to continue to expand our markets globally by attracting buyers who want something different than a conventional massproduced retail shopping experience and sellers who are engaging in their creative passion working for themselves and defining success on their own terms 

the retail landscape continues to change as more people around the world choose to purchase goods online or from a mobile device emarketer a market research company estimated that worldwide retail ecommerce sales were 2 trillion in 2016 up from 15 trillion in 2015 they expect worldwide retail ecommerce to generate doubledigit growth each year through 2020 and sales to reach 4 trillion by the end of the fouryear period source emarketer  worldwide retail ecommerce sales the emarketer forecast for 2016 whereas most large retailers emphasize efficiency and scale and pressure their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to offer goods produced at volume at the lowestpossible prices our approach to commerce is fundamentally different and based on human connections we believe that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style not simply massproduced generic goods finding these goods can be difficult as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces etsy sellers offer goods in over 50 retail categories including furniture jewelry stationery clothing home goods craft supplies and vintage items 

two of our largest opportunities are to raise awareness among potential and existing buyers about the breadth and depth of items available on etsycom and to encourage them to make more frequent purchases given the more than 50 retail categories in which etsy sellers have offerings we believe we can establish etsycom as a shopping destination not just for gifts and special occasions but also for goods buyers use in their everyday lives we also believe that this perception shift and our efforts to make the shopping experience easier for etsy buyers through technological enhancements to our capabilities in areas such as search and recommendations will encourage buyers to make more frequent purchases in our markets in addition we believe that our new market etsy studio will help us serve our craft supplies sellers better and reach a broader audience of craft supplies buyers around the world according to the association for creative industries creative products is an approximately 

44 billion market in the united states however the vast majority of sales currently take place offline source association for creative industries  2016 creative products size of the industry study etsy studio offers a differentiated buyer experience that combines shopping and inspiration in one destination which we believe creates a unique online opportunity for etsy within this large addressable market 

the nature of work also continues to shift and more people than ever are choosing employment outside of traditional ninetofive jobs according to a mckinsey global institute study the “mckinsey study” 2030 of the workingage population or up to 162 million people currently engage in independent work in the us and eu15 the mckinsey study notes that 3045 of the workingage population in these countries say they would like to earn either primary or supplemental income through independent work and consider themselves at least somewhat likely to pursue the option implying the number of independent workers in the us and the eu15 could grow to up to 267 million source mckinsey global institute  independent work choice necessity and the gig economy we believe that our base of etsy sellers reflects these changing dynamics active sellers on etsy grew at 18  cagr between 2013 and 2016 as more and more people chose to start a business additionally our 2016 seller survey found that 33  of sellers in our markets have their creative business as their sole occupation compared to 30  in our 2014 seller survey reflecting an increasing number of people that are choosing to focus on independent work full time as more and more people around the world choose to pursue their passions we are focused on providing creative entrepreneurs with a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of services and tools specifically designed to support them as they start manage and scale their businesses

launched in 2005 etsycom is our largest market and it supports people buying and selling in nearly every country in the world it offers buyers nearly 45 million  unique listings of handmade and vintage goods and craft supplies we believe that that the breadth and depth of the items available help to position etsycom as a goto shopping destination for more than just special occasions we plan to launch etsy studio in 2017 which will serve as a dedicated craft supplies market we believe our ability to leverage our prior investments in etsycom including search technology payments advertising and shipping to launch and scale etsy studio will give us a competitive advantage in this market and any other markets we may launch we also own alm a handmade and supplies market for sellers and buyers in france

our platform makes it easy for an etsy seller to open a shop and operate her business according to our 2016  seller survey for every hour that an etsy seller spends making her products she spends almost another hour doing businessrelated tasks including inventory management marketing shipping customer service and accounting 

  

  

we are creating a cohesive platform of seller services and tools that help etsy sellers start manage and scale their businesses our services platform includes the following 

 

 

 

our technology 

our widely respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices our team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment we update the code that runs the etsy website as often as every 20  minutes and deploy code to various systems as often as 70  times per day to enhance the performance of our platform we collect and analyze a large volume of data for example we currently capture more than one billion  usergenerated events every day to produce personalized recommendations improve our search experience and utilize ab test features on our site 

our use of machine learning algorithms creates an engaging shopping experience and also helps etsy sellers and etsy buyers connect across our platform we apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery process enabling shoppers to more easily browse filter for and buy that perfect item even when they may not have something specific in mind 

machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language we translate listings within our etsycom market into 10  languages and plan to translate listings on etsy studio into several key languages translating listings significantly increases the inventory available to nonenglish speaking etsy buyers and gives etsy sellers access to a truly global audience we also translate conversations and reviews and in 2016 began to apply machine translation to promoted listings 

we are a mobilefirst company meaning mobile is integrated into everything that we do in recent years we have focused on expanding our mobile capabilities we developed our “sell on etsy” mobile app to help the etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders our mobile website and our “buy on etsy” mobile app for etsy buyers which we developed to keep etsy buyers engaged wherever they are include search discovery curation personalization and social shopping features optimized for the mobile experience 

for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 64  of our visits and approximately 48  of our gms were generated on a mobile device this is a solid improvement compared with 2015  during which 60  of our visits and 43  of our gms were generated on a mobile device we are focused on continuing to narrow the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms

the passion and loyalty demonstrated by etsy sellers and etsy buyers is the foundation for the continued growth and current scale of our platform see “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our performance — growth and retention of active sellers and active buyers ” for more information 



  



commitment to integrity and transparency 

members of our community rely on us to maintain trusted markets our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers etsy buyers etsy wholesale partners and production partners participating on our platform most fundamentally we require that goods listed in our markets be handmade vintage or craft supplies in 2017 we clarified our policies on etsycom to make it easier for sellers and buyers around the world to understand how we define handmade 

transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness for example we publish an annual progress report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come we also publish an annual transparency report which among other things describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on etsycom or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights in 2016 we closed 4525 etsycom shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 263315 etsycom accounts for nonip policy violations 

we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell we also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies for example our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithmswe also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes 

we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and etsy buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media the trustworthiness of etsycom and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business 

our strategy the path ahead 

our selleraligned business model means that we succeed when our sellers succeed we are focused on helping sellers grow their sales within our markets and building a cohesive services platform to help them start manage and scale their businesses 

our markets 

the power of human connection is central to the etsy experience and we connect creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world we continue to nurture etsycom and are also launching etsy studio to better serve craft supplies sellers and to broaden our reach to craft supplies buyers around the world we want to create the best shopping experience for etsy buyers our markets strategy is to expand our overall base of buyers and drive frequency with existing buyers we plan to accomplish this strategy through three main initiatives 

 

 

 

we formerly referred to initiatives within our markets strategy as “etsy everyday” and “build local marketplaces globally” the above initiatives reflect these ongoing efforts but have been refined to better capture our evolving business opportunities  

our services 

we continue to focus on offering highimpact services that enable etsy sellers to start manage and scale their businesses we launched our first seller service in late 2011 and in 2016  seller services represented 2009 million  550  of our revenue a 470  increase over 2015  seller services revenue growth has been driven by service launches and enhancements that have allowed etsy sellers to address the administrative tasks associated with running a business for example in 2016  we increased the number of countries where direct checkout is available to 36  countries up from 22  countries in 2015  we also made fedex and expedited united states postal service labels available through shipping labels expanded the inventory available within promoted listings and launched our custom website service pattern we are building a cohesive suite of services and tools specifically designed to help etsy sellers start manage and scale their businesses 

 

 

 

in 2017 we introduced shop manager which enables etsy sellers to access many of these tools and services along with all of their etsy shops in one convenient place we believe that this moves us closer to our long term goal of becoming the central hub for creative entrepreneurs and supporting them wherever they choose to pursue commerce 

competition 

we compete for the etsy seller with both retailers and companies that sell software to small businesses an etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our markets or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform we are able to compete for etsy sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our markets and the breadth of our online presence the number and engagement of etsy buyers our seller services our seller education resources and tools our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for etsy buyers based on the unique goods that etsy sellers list in our markets our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience our reputation as trusted markets our mobile apps ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws primarily including trade secret copyright and trademark laws and to a lesser extent patent laws in the united states and abroad and we use confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property 

while we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property we file patents and register domain names trademarks and service marks in the united states and abroad we also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks 

circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the united states or other countries in which we operate and changes in legal frameworks may impact the scope enforceability and validity of rights in addition the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our ability to compete and our operating results 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we are subject to a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently changing laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example us federal and state laws eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws 

emerging growth company status 

as of june 30 2016 we had a public float of greater than 700 million and are therefore no longer considered an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012

 item 1a risk factors  

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below our consolidated financial statements and related notes “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and the other information in this annual report if any of these risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected as a result the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

we have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

we incurred net losses  of 299 million  541 million  and 152 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively as of december 31 2016  we had an accumulated deficit  of 1163 million  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we hire additional employees increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and continue to invest in the development of our platform including our seller services and tools and technological enhancements these efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses in addition our revenue may decline for a number of reasons including those described in these risk factors 

further our revenue growth rate may continue to decelerate in the future for a number of reasons including the gradual deceleration of our gms growth rate for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue ” you should not rely on growth rates of prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control these reasons include those described in these risk factors and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their 

models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

in addition we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active sellers and active buyers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers seller engagement the number of active buyers buyer engagement and our ability to maintain trusted markets we must continue to encourage etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our seller services and encourage etsy buyers to return and purchase items in our markets more frequently 

we want to create the best shopping experience for etsy buyers and are focused on making enhancements that encourage purchase frequency we believe that many new etsy sellers and etsy buyers find etsycom by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers if existing etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform they may stop listing items in our markets and using our seller services and may stop referring others to us likewise if existing etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by etsy sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us under these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new etsy sellers and etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense 

even if we are able to attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers to replace the ones that we lose they may not maintain the same level of activity and the revenue generated from new etsy sellers and etsy buyers may not be as high as the revenue generated from the ones who leave our markets if we are unable to retain existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers and attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers who contribute to an active community our growth prospects could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

additionally the demand for the goods listed in our markets is dependent on consumer preferences which can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures if demand for the goods that etsy sellers offer declines we may not be able to attract and retain etsy buyers and our business would be harmed trends in sociallyconscious consumerism and buying locally could also shift or slow which would make it more difficult to attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue 

the trustworthiness of our markets and the connections within our community are important to our success if we are unable to maintain them our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could suffer 

we have built trusted markets that embody our valuesbased culture our reputation depends upon our etsy sellers their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies we establish trust in our markets in a variety of ways for example our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers etsy buyers etsy wholesale partners and production partners participating on our platform we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a small business that adheres to certain principles our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies we also have sophisticated tools to detect fraud and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform in addition production partners who apply to join etsy manufacturing must commit to ethical expectations and to operating a safe and just workplace with transparency and reliable customer service 

etsys transparency with our community helps to support the trustworthiness of our markets for example we publish an annual progress report that details our progress toward our ideals and shares our goals for the years to come and we also release an annual transparency report which among other things describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on our platform or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights 

we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections among members of our community through our communication tools seller stories on our website and our inperson events which highlight personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories and use tools 

such as shop videos to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned when that happens our case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes 

we also encourage our employees to build meaningful connections with other members of our community for example we ask employees to perform support rotations to help foster connections with etsy sellers and etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs 

the trustworthiness of our markets and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 if we are unable to maintain trustworthy markets and encourage connections among members of our community then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected 

adherence to our values and our focus on our mission and longterm sustainability may negatively influence our short or mediumterm financial performance 

our values are integral to everything we do accordingly we intend to focus on the longterm sustainability of our business and work toward our mission to reimagine commerce and expand the etsy economy we may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and the etsy economy and therefore our stockholders over a longer period of time even if those actions do not maximize short or mediumterm financial results however these longerterm benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all for example 

 

 

 

we are a certified b corporation the term “certified b corporation” does not refer to a particular form of legal entity but instead refers to companies that are certified by b lab an independent nonprofit organization as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance accountability and transparency our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a certified b corporation whether by our choice or by our failure to meet b lab’s certification requirements if that change in status were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by certified b corporations for example since we do not intend to reorganize as a public benefit corporation 

under delaware law our future status as a certified b corporation may be affected likewise our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported b corporation score declines and that created a perception that we have slipped in our satisfaction of the certified b corporation standards similarly our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with our values 

if we are not able to enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers our growth prospects may be harmed 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands we spend substantial time and resources understanding the needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers and responding to them for example we enhance our seller services search and discovery functionality and the member experience on a regular basis we also regularly launch new products and services for example in 2016 we launched a new seller service pattern which enables etsy sellers to create their own custom website we also introduced a number of tools such as google shopping which allows sellers to reach audiences off of etsy by advertising their listings in google search results in 2017 we plan to launch a new craft supplies market etsy studio to serve our craft supplies sellers and help them reach a broader audience of craft supplies buyers around the world our effectiveness in enhancing our current offerings and introducing new offerings may impact our revenue growth and our operating results 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons in addition new offerings may not be successful due to defects or errors negative publicity or our failure to market them effectively 

new offerings may not drive increases in revenue may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy etsy sellers and etsy buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing them 

we expect to continue to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business but those efforts may not be effective 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our markets and broader platform is important to our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers we believe that much of the historical growth in the number of active sellers and active buyers has originated from wordofmouth referrals and other organic means as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited although increasing in recent years we launched our first brand marketing campaign in 2016 and intend to invest significant resources in marketing in the future particularly brand marketing focused on bringing more etsy buyers to our platform and encouraging existing buyers to return more frequently we anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as we continue to invest in our marketing efforts and as competition increases and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult 

an important part of our markets strategy is to position etsys markets as goto shopping destinations for unique items that buyers can use in their everyday lives our growth will depend in part on our ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing etsy buyers and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through revenue growth if we are not able to change our brand perception and raise awareness of the breadth and depth of items available in our markets our business could be adversely affected the marketing efforts we implement may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans external factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as search engine optimization social media usage mobile push notifications and email we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google bing and yahoo search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our markets and therefore reduce the number of visits to our markets the growing use of online adblocking software including on mobile devices may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more etsy buyers to our platform we also obtain a significant number of visits through email advertising if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to etsy sellers and etsy buyers or if etsy sellers and etsy buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected social 

networking websites such as facebook and pinterest are another important source of visits to our markets as online commerce and social networking evolve we must continue to maintain a presence within these networks 

if the mobile solutions available to etsy sellers and etsy buyers are not effective the use of our platform could decline 

purchases made on mobile devices by consumers including etsy buyers have increased significantly in recent years the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices etsy sellers’ ability to manage and scale their businesses may be harmed and consequently our business may suffer further although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both etsy sellers and etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device we depend on etsy sellers and etsy buyers using our mobile apps for the optimal mobile experience visits to our markets through a mobile website may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through our mobile app or through desktop which could result in less revenue for us additionally although conversion rates have continued to increase across mobile websites mobile apps and desktop these rates may slow or stall which could also have a negative impact on revenue 

as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them in addition supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources 

the success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as 

 

 

 

 if etsy sellers and etsy buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected 

expanding our community outside of the united states is an important part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

our vision is global and local and we are focused on expanding outside of the united states   although we have a significant number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers outside of the united states we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the united states and may not execute our strategy successfully operating outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing and staffing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform to local markets 

despite our execution efforts the goods that etsy sellers list on etsycom may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with the etsy brand as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to etsycom from etsy buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that a majority of the goods listed on our platform are denominated in us dollars our success outside the united states will be linked to our ability to attract local etsy sellers and etsy buyers to our markets if we are not able to expand outside of the united states successfully our growth prospects could be harmed an inability to develop etsys community globally or to otherwise grow our business outside of the united states on a costeffective basis could adversely affect our gms revenue and operating results 

competition is also likely to intensify outside of the united states both where we operate now and where we plan to expand our operations local companies based outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on their local markets some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow internationally more quickly than we will 

continued expansion outside of the united states may also require significant financial investment these investments include marketing  enhancing our machine translation and machine learning to help sellers and buyers connect even if they do not speak the same language forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses 

further expansion outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if etsy sellers are not our business could be adversely affected 

if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the united states and cannot manage these risks effectively the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets 

our payments system depends on thirdparty providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations 

etsy buyers primarily pay for purchases using direct checkout or paypal in the united states and other countries where direct checkout is available etsy buyers can use direct checkout on our platform to pay with credit cards debit cards bank transfers paypal and in certain markets apple pay android pay and etsy gift cards rather than being directed to a thirdparty payment platform a significant portion of our gms approximately 78  is processed through direct checkout and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from direct checkout 

we have engaged thirdparty service providers to perform underlying compliance card processing and payment disbursing currency exchange identity verification and fraud analysis services if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate etsy sellers’ ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed for example thirdparty service providers may experience service outages from time to time that impact etsy in july 2016 a thirdparty payment processor experienced a technical issue that caused payment processing delays and complications for purchases through direct checkout which required etsy to develop a shortterm manual solution these payment processing delays and complications did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 if a thirdparty payment processor has significant outages in the future and we do not have alternative payment processors in place or are unable to provide our own solution our business could be harmed in addition if our thirdparty providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses could increase if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to etsy sellers some etsy sellers may stop using direct checkout stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether 

the laws and regulations related to payments are complex evolving and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources could result in liabilities or could force us to stop offering direct checkout additionally changes in payment regulation may occur that could render our payments system less profitable for example any significant change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations may negatively impact direct checkout 

 as we expand the availability of direct checkout or offer new payment methods to etsy sellers and etsy buyers in the future we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements 

further through our agreements with our thirdparty payment processors we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard which are subject to change failure to comply with these rules and certification requirements could impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations with our thirdparty payment processors and could result in potential fines we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply in addition similar to a potential increase in costs from thirdparty providers described above any increased costs associated with compliance with payment card association rules could lead to increased fees for etsy or etsy sellers which may negatively impact direct checkout usage and our markets 

our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns natural disasters public health crises political crises or other unexpected events 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods and services available in our platform may be reduced this would cause sales in our markets and seller services revenue to decline and adversely impact our business conversely if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of etsy sellers offering their goods in our markets could decline and the number of goods listed in our markets could decline in addition we believe that currency exchange rates are dampening the demand from buyers outside the united states for goods denominated in us dollars which is impacting our gms as of december 31 2016  approximately 88  of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political crises such as terrorist attacks war and other political instability or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our thirdparty service providers for example when hurricane sandy struck new york in october 2012 our headquarters in brooklyn was closed for five days and we experienced a heavy volume of support requests from etsy sellers and etsy buyers which required us to devote additional resources to handle those requests events of this type could impact etsy sellers’ ability to continue producing goods for sale in our markets these events may also impact consumer perceptions of wellbeing and security which may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending if any of these events occurs our business could be adversely affected 

if sensitive information about members of our community is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are subject to cyber attacks members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer 

like all online services our platform is vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of our members personal or financial information cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property as we gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks although we rely on a variety of security measures including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security particularly given the increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists security breaches can also occur as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers 

additionally some of our third party service providers such as identify verification and payment processing providers regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive member data if these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices or experience a breach of their networks our members data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services have occurred regularly in the past and we expect they will continue to occur in the future if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or if we fail to respond appropriately to any security breaches that we may experience people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face potential liability regulatory investigation costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation for maintaining trusted markets 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain both etsy sellers and etsy buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete for etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software and services to small businesses in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces including through commerce channels on social networks like facebook and instagram she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our markets or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform such as square intuit and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy sellers based on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba or national retail chains such as west elm or target or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for etsy sellers to match 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy buyers based on many factors including 

 

 

 



 

 

 many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do 

they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do further our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services causing etsy sellers and etsy buyers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services additionally we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to etsy buyers 

a small portion of etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform for example etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by an etsy seller or that an etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions 

although our case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers or damage our reputation a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to etsy buyers could harm etsy sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of etsy sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or political unrest disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of etsy sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of etsy buyers which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use illegal or unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of illegal or unethical business practices by etsy sellers or other members of our community our policies promote legal and ethical business practices such as encouraging etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions however we do not control etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

failure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business 

although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our markets those measures may not always be effective 

for example etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data under current credit card practices we could be held liable for orders placed through direct checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent 

transactions we may not be able to do so effectively as a result our business could be adversely affected we could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our markets 

negative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers and damage our reputation 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our markets internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in 2015 rules approved by the federal communications commission went into effect that prohibit internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain “fast traffic” lanes however the rules are subject to pending legal challenges and if they are overturned or if the current federal communications commission revokes or changes the rules our business could be adversely impacted outside of the united states government regulation of the internet including the idea of network neutrality may be developing or nonexistent as a result we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and etsy sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform 

the reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as the number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers volume of traffic number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow the operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex and we could experience operational failures if we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability the investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our business and to improve our operating results in the long term but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce profitability in the near term 

we also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet and mobile infrastructure this includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products 

thirdparty providers host much of our technology infrastructure any disruption in their services or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our markets could significantly harm our business we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be adversely affected which could harm our growth prospects and our business 

our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success 

we strive to attract retain and motivate employees from our office administrators to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the employees we need to maintain our competitive position 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

 

 

 

 

 

 our ability to attract retain and motivate employees including our management team is important to our success in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our ceo or cfo could adversely affect our business other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

filling engineering product management and other technical positions in the new york city area is particularly challenging especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees if we are not able to maintain our engineering culture and broader company culture then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed 

the growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business such as in headcount the number of etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have etsy sellers and etsy buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future both in the united states and abroad for example our headcount has grown from 251 employees on december 31 2011 to   1043  employees on december 31 2016  the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure for example we may need to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and enhance our reporting systems and procedures as we continue to grow our operating expenses will increase if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future for example in september 2016 we acquired blackbird technologies inc acquisitions may divert management’s time and focus from operating our business acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash issue stock incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 

 

 

 

 

 

 moreover we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect or in the time frame we expect we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and laws and regulations focused on internet service providers and online commerce such as online payments privacy antispam data security and protection online platform liability intellectual property and consumer protection in light of our international operations we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering sanctions anticorruption and export control laws these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort 

additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by internet service providers or online commerce for example laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate and assess the privacy requirements relating to the use of thirdparty “cookies” “web beacons” and other methods of online tracking the united states the european union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could i significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools and ii require internet service providers to disclose user information to regulatory authorities 

some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of etsy buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business could be adversely affected 

in some cases nonus privacy data security and protection consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the united states and are actively enforced for example the european union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations and provided for more onerous penalties under such laws than the united states consequently the expansion of our operations internationally may require changes to the ways we display collect and use consumer information and may necessitate unfavorable product changes for our nonus users 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments could impede the growth of internet service providers or online commerce it is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business 

we may be subject to claims that items listed in our markets are counterfeit infringing or illegal 

although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our markets by etsy sellers we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our markets infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our markets we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our markets and in certain cases closing the shops of etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability in particular we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by etsy sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states under current us copyright law and the communications decency act we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from copyright liability for content posted on 

our platform by etsy sellers and etsy buyers however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions these safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably in that event we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of etsy sellers 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by etsy sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platform less userfriendly moreover public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our markets even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which are extremely costly to defend could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims thirdparties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters 

in addition some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors and patent holding companies have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights in one or more jurisdictions where etsy does business we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including class action lawsuits for example as described further in “ note 14—commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters in connection with the litigation described in this annual  report and in connection with any future lawsuits any lawsuit to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and to a lesser extent patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks which may not always be comprehensive in scope in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged and may be of limited territorial reach while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property to 

the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and authorized uses may not have the intended effect even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable the legal framework surrounding protection of intellectual property changes frequently throughout the world and these changes may impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against third party claims if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software 

the software powering our markets incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses relied upon by etsy and the internet and technology industries generally have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our markets under certain open source licenses if certain conditions were met we could be required to publicly release aspects of the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available while we may benefit from the contributions of others our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and our etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax provincial taxes goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to businesses like ours and to etsy sellers and etsy buyers is a complex and evolving issue significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to etsy sellers’ businesses one or more states the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting recordkeeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce for example taxing authorities in the united states and other countries have identified ecommerce platforms as a means to calculate collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet and are considering related legislation new legislation could require us or etsy sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply including costs associated with tax calculation collection remittance and audit requirements which could make selling in our markets less attractive and could adversely affect our business 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and in numerous other jurisdictions we record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated further our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in january 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states our new corporate structure changed how we use our intellectual property and implemented certain intercompany arrangements we believe this may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate over the long term and other operational efficiencies however the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure moreover these tax laws are subject to change tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences if our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected 

if our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business 

our insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities such as general liability property coverage errors and omissions liability employment liability business interruptions data breaches crime product liability and directors’ and officers’ liability for certain types of business risk we may not be able to or may choose not to acquire insurance in addition we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums andor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain additionally if any of our insurers becomes insolvent it would be unable to pay any claims that we make 

operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention in addition our management team has limited experience managing a public company 

as a public company we incur substantial legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations of the sec the rules and regulations of nasdaq also apply to us as part of these requirements we have established and maintained effective disclosure and financial controls and made changes to our corporate governance practices we expect that continued compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming in addition as a public company we may be subject to stockholder activism which can lead to additional substantial costs distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate 

most of our management and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings in addition our management and other personnel divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company in particular we have incurred significant expense and devoted substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we may need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting it also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting although our management has determined and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 

december 31 2016 we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control in the future 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future it could harm our operating results cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations or nasdaq listing requirements  adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls such as section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility however our credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders borrowing funds would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit our operations it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for example since january 1 2016 our common stocks daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 636 to a high of 1581 through february 24 2017 the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business results of operations or financial condition stock prices of many technology companies have historically been highly volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation for example as described further in “ note 14—commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

if analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our common stock would likely decline if few analysts cover us demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility as a result stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our 

management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law or dgcl may delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 of the dgcl imposes certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

key operating and financial metrics   

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our ecosystem allocate our resources such as capital people and technology investments and assess the performance of our business the unaudited key operating metrics unaudited nongaap financial measure and key financial metrics we use are 



gms 

gross merchandise sales or gms is the dollar value of items sold in our markets within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by etsy gms is largely driven by transactions in our markets and is not directly impacted by seller services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our markets we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of etsy sellers the satisfaction of etsy buyers the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net loss  adjusted to exclude interest and other nonoperating expense net  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  loss on asset impairment  net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities  foreign exchange loss  acquisitionrelated expenses  and contributions to good work institute formerly etsyorg  see “ nongaap financial measures ” for information regarding our use of adjusted ebitda including its limitations as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is an etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include transaction fees listing fees and fees for direct checkout promoted listings shipping labels pattern google shopping and etsy wholesale enrollment an etsy seller is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy seller accounts we succeed when etsy sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our ecosystem 

active buyers 

an active buyer is an etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months an etsy buyer is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy buyer accounts we generate revenue when etsy buyers order items from etsy sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of etsy buyers and the health of our ecosystem 

mobile visits 

a visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app a visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity a mobile visit is a visit that occurs on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone etsy sellers are increasingly using mobile devices to manage their listings and track their business performance on our platform in addition etsy buyers increasingly use mobile devices to search browse and purchase items on our platform we view percent mobile visits as a key indicator of the level of engagement of etsy sellers and etsy buyers on our mobile website and mobile apps and of our ability to sustain gms and revenue 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the etsy seller or the shipping address for the etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue

revenue   

  



gms increased   4536 million  or 190  to  28 billion  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  on a currencyneutral basis excluding the direct impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth for the year ended december 31 2016  would have been 200  or approximately one  percentage point higher than the reported 190  growth supporting this growth in gms active sellers increased   118  to 17 million  and active buyers increased   188  to 286 million  at december 31 2016  compared to december 31 2015  

during the year ended december 31 2016  percent mobile visits increased as a percentage of total visits to approximately 64  up from approximately 60  for the year ended december 31 2015  and mobile gms increased  as a percentage of total gms to approximately 48  up  from approximately 43  for the year ended december 31 2015  these increases were a result of increased mobile traffic and to a lesser extent continued improvements in our mobile offerings for etsy buyers mobile gms continued to grow faster than mobile visits and as a result the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms narrowed slightly yearoveryear mobile app and mobile web gms and conversion rates each continued to grow faster than desktop gms we anticipate conversion rate gains across both mobile and desktop in 2017 that reflect improvements in our search and recommendations capabilities we believe that we will continue to see the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms narrow over time 

for the year ended december 31 2016  international gms increased  as a percentage of total gms to 304  from 298  for the year ended december 31 2015  the improved  performance in percent international gms was largely driven by gms growth between us buyers and international sellers and gms growth between buyers and sellers outside of the us both in the same country and crossborder we continue to believe the decline  of gms between us sellers and international buyers which decreased 8  for the year ended december 31 2016  is indicative of the indirect impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on international buyer behavior which is difficult to estimate finally gms growth  between international buyers and sellers in the same country remains the fastest growing category of international gms gms between international buyers and sellers in the same country grew approximately 47  yearoveryear during the year ended december 31 2016  and has grown from our smallest category historically to be more similar in size to gms between international buyers and sellers in different countries we believe the robust growth  in this gms category demonstrates the progress we are making on our strategy to build and deepen local etsy communities around the world

seller services revenue increased   642 million  or 470  to  2009 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the growth  in seller services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from direct checkout which continued to benefit from the integration of paypal through the anniversary of this integration at the end of the fourth quarter as this integration was a substantial driver of yearoveryear seller services revenue growth we expect direct checkout and seller services revenue growth to decelerate in 2017 seller services revenue also benefited from 

the growth in revenue from promoted listings and shipping labels and to a lesser extent a modest contribution from pattern by etsy the increase in promoted listings revenue was due to higher click volume and overall product enhancements the increase in shipping label revenue reflects a combination of an increase in label volume and an increase in average margin per label seller services revenue continued to outpace growth in markets revenue during 2016 as of december 31 2016  517  of active sellers use one or more of our seller services compared to 481  of active sellers as of december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  455  of active sellers used direct checkout 159  of active sellers used promoted listings 263  of active sellers in the united states and canada used shipping labels and 25  of active sellers used pattern we expect modest contributions to revenue from recently launched seller services and tools in 2017 

other revenue increased   17 million  or 392  to  59 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  mainly due to the recognition of 17 million in revenue from accumulated unused gift card funds received from our thirdparty service provider this represents the threeyear cumulative value of gift cards that the thirdparty service provider has concluded are not likely to be redeemed future unused gift card revenue will be recognized monthly as earned and is not anticipated to be significant in future periods this increase  was partially offset by a reduction of processing fees from paypal a thirdparty payment processor as a result of its integration into direct checkout

other expense net   

  



other expense net  was 261 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  mainly due to a foreign currency loss due to intercompany debt in connection with the revised global corporate structure that we implemented on january 1 2015 the loss was in addition to the marktomarket loss related to convertible warrants as a result of the ipo the convertible warrants are now classified as equity instruments and do not require additional marktomarket adjustments other expense net  was  205 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of a currency exchange loss related to the intercompany debt and cash settlements resulting in realized currency loss as well as interest expense largely associated with the buildtosuit lease accounting for our new corporate headquarters

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more seller services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2016  decreased slightly when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015  we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our growth rates moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially  quartertoquarter for all periods presented above other than the first quarter of 2016  corresponding  to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

liquidity and capital resources   

the following tables show our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and net working capital as of the dates indicated 



as of december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds were held for future capital investments and working capital purposes through december 31 2016  we have invested approximately 40 million  into the new brooklyn new york headquarters and do not expect any further significant cash outlays related to this buildout 

during the first quarter of 2016 our shortterm investments a majority of which were held in fixedincome funds and aaarated us government and agency securities increased as the result of our investment of excess working capital funds into shortterm instruments aligned with our investment strategy these investments are intended to allow us to preserve our principal maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs deliver positive yields and continue to provide us with direct fiduciary control in accordance with our investment policy all investments have maturities no longer than 24 months with the average maturity of these investments maintained at 12 months or less 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement described below under “credit facility” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in “ — key factors affecting our performance ” above and in our “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

sources of liquidity 

on april 21 2015 we completed our initial public offering or ipo in which we issued and sold 13333333  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 1600  per share we received net proceeds of 1944 million  after deducting underwriting discounts of 139 million  and other offering expenses of approximately 51 million  these expenses were recorded against the proceeds received from the ipo in addition we incurred approximately 03 million  in iporelated expenses not deductible from ipo proceeds 

credit facility 

in may 2014  we entered into a 350 million  senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with several lenders or the credit agreement in march 2015  we amended the credit agreement to increase the credit facility to 500 million  in december 2015 we amended the credit agreement to clarify certain provisions relating to permitted investments and to make other immaterial updates as amended the credit agreement will mature in may 2019  the amended credit agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of 100 million  and a swingline loan sublimit of 150 million  a description of the terms of the credit agreement is included in “ note 7—debt ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of february 28 2017 no amounts have been drawn under the credit facility

in addition we have uncertain tax positions of 236 million  and nonincome tax related contingency reserves of 03 million  which are not reflected in the table as the ultimate resolution and timing are uncertain 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates   

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on 

historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition income taxes website development costs and internaluse software purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases and stockbased compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see “ note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of markets activities and the seller services provided to etsy sellers to help them start manage and scale their business our largest market is etsycom we also own a little market a handmade and supplies market for sellers and buyers in france markets revenue is primarily made up of the 35 transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on etsycom and the 020 listing fee she pays for each item she lists on etsycom seller services revenue includes the fees etsy sellers pay for services which include direct checkout a payment processing service promoted listings an ad service for prominent placement in onsite search results shipping labels which allow etsy sellers to purchase shipping labels through our platform and pattern by etsy launched in april 2016 which enables sellers to easily create their own custom website other revenue typically includes revenue generated from commercial partnerships 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the etsy seller 3 the collection of fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the etsy seller is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we are the primary obligor in a transaction have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers among other factors based on our evaluation of these factors revenue is recorded net of gross merchandise values associated with the transaction 

markets revenue  markets revenue is primarily made up of two components the 35  transaction fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on etsycom exclusive of shipping fees charged and the listing fee of 020  she pays for each item she lists on etsycom transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made listing fees are recognized ratably over a four month listing period unless the item is sold or the seller relists it at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized revenue from completed wholesale transactions through etsycom and transaction and listing revenue for other markets including alm are also included in markets revenue 

seller services revenue  seller services revenue consists of fees an etsy seller pays us for the seller services she uses including direct checkout promoted listings shipping labels and pattern 

 other revenue  other revenue includes the fees we receive from paypal for transactions that occur outside of direct checkout which is recognized as transactions are processed funds we receive from a thirdparty for unused etsy gift cards which are 

recognized when the thirdparty approves the release of these funds and revenue from other commercial partnerships which are recognized as earned over the term of the contract 

internaluse software and website development costs 

costs incurred to develop software for internal use and for our website are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three  years in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended we also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality costs related to the design or maintenance of internaluse software and website development are expensed as incurred we periodically review these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed placed in service removed from service or replaced by other internallydeveloped or thirdparty software if an asset is not expected to provide any future benefit the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed 

leases 

we lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under noncancelable lease agreements the leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases for operating leases rent is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease period for capital leases we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability 

we consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newlyleased office space to determine if we are considered to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period if we determine that we are the owner of the construction project we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability “buildtosuit accounting” upon occupancy for buildtosuit leases we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the saleleaseback accounting guidance if the lease meets the saleleaseback criteria we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease if upon completion of construction the project does not meet the “saleleaseback” criteria the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes 

in may 2016 we took possession of our corporate headquarters in brooklyn upon substantial completion of the construction phase of the buildout upon completion of the project we performed a saleleaseback analysis pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” 840  leases  to determine the appropriateness of removing the previously capitalized assets from the consolidated balance sheets we concluded that components of “continuing involvement” were evident as a result of this review precluding the derecognition of the related assets from the consolidated balance sheets in conjunction with the lease we also recorded a facility financing obligation equal to the fair market value of the assets received from the landlord at the end of the lease term including exercise of any renewal options the net remaining facility financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a noncash gain on sale of the property we do not report rent expense for the lease rather rental payments under the lease are recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and interest expense and the associated asset capitalized throughout the construction project is depreciated over its determined useful life 

income taxes 

we account for the income tax benefit provision based on income loss before income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement 

we recognize interest and penalties if any associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 

business combinations intangible assets and goodwill 

we have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future the results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash equity or a combination of the two in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies estimates of future revenues and cash flows discount rates and selection of comparable companies 

when we issue stockbased or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for postcombination services the evaluation includes among other things whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition date if continued employment is required for vesting the awards are treated as compensation for postcombination services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period 

we carry intangible assets at cost and we amortize them on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives typically three years when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors “step zero” to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then additional impairment testing is not required however if we conclude otherwise we are then required to perform the first of a twostep impairment test the first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value including goodwill if the estimated fair value exceeds book value goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary if however the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value then a second step is required that compares the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value the estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internallygenerated and unrecognized intangible and tangible net assets if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

stockbased compensation 

stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” are awarded to employees members of our board of directors and nonemployee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date stock options generally vest over a four year period with 25  of the shares underlying the options vesting after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period subject to continued service with us through each vesting date rsus generally vest 25  after the first year following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12 quarter period contingent on continued employment with us on each vesting date 

stockbased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq on the grant date forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

we account for stockbased compensation arrangements with nonemployees using a fair value approach the fair value of these options is measured using the blackscholes optionpricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods other than the expected life which is assumed to be the contractual life of the option the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 

we account for stockbased compensation arrangements in restricted shares subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash as liabilityclassified stock awards these awards are remeasured at each reporting 

period with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards unless the put option is exercised the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option 

key assumptions 

our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

  

 

 

 

 

 in determining the fair value of stock options granted the following weighted average assumptions were used in the blackscholes optionpricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2016  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in cash deposits money market funds fixedincome funds and aaarated us government and agency securities the fair value of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the shortterm nature of these instruments as of december 31 2016  no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility any future borrowings incurred under the credit facility would accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence as described above the majority of our current interest expense is attributable to our facility financing obligation related to our buildtosuit lease and is not impacted by external factors on interest rates a 10 increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense 

currency risk 

approximately 88  of our gms is denominated in us dollars and therefore the resulting revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however in the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 12  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and as a result was impacted by currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2016  would have been 200  or approximately one  percentage point higher than the reported 190  growth in addition we believe weaker local currencies in key international markets continued to dampen the demand for us dollardenominated goods during the year ended december 31 2016  impacting both gms growth and percent international gms 

our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates particularly changes in the pound sterling and euro fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations on january 1 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states which resulted in a us dollardenominated intercompany debt on a eurodenominated ledger that may be subject to continued currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in an increase or decrease to currency exchange loss gain of 412 million

etsy buyers visit our marketplace to discover a broad selection of unique goods in dozens of retail categories that are hard to find elsewhere ranging from a 5 ornament to a 50 handknit sweater to a 2000 custommade coffee table in a 2015 survey of etsy buyers 92 agreed that etsy offers products they cannot find elsewhere we believe many etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience we believe they also value craftsmanship artistry uniqueness authenticity and sustainability we find that etsy buyers want to know how items were made where they were made and who made them in our marketplace etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with etsy sellers etsy buyers can also purchase customized items or other bespoke goods from etsy sellers by buying in our marketplace etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world as of december 31 2015  there were 240 million  active buyers on our platform 



  wholesale partners 

retailers who have joined our wholesale offering which we launched in august 2014 are also part of our community from local boutiques to national chains such as land of nod lou  grey macys and whole foods retailers use our platform to connect directly with etsy sellers and to add unique and distinctive items to their store offerings in 2015 we introduced our wholesale retailer commitments which are a set of guidelines that our large retail partners have agreed to follow when 

working with etsy sellers the commitments which include terms such as quick and fair payment are intended to foster relationships that lead to mutual success 

manufacturing partners 

etsys mission to reimagine commerce includes our efforts to reimagine manufacturing we are committed to helping etsy sellers who share our values of authorship responsibility and transparency and who want to grow their businesses by forming responsible partnerships with manufacturers for example an etsy seller might work with a cutandsew shop to make clothes she has designed a casting house that casts wax models for her jewelry designs or a digital printing house that prints her photographs on household items 

in addition to finding manufacturers on their own etsy sellers can find manufacturers through our new etsy manufacturing marketplace that we launched in september 2015 we launched etsy manufacturing to help etsy sellers connect directly with manufacturers who commit to certain practices and value transparent connections we hope to foster responsible and creative partnerships between the designers and manufacturers of goods to prioritize transparency and to help our community learn about the unique stories and people behind each item manufacturers who apply to join etsy manufacturing must commit to certain ethical expectations and to operating a safe and just workplace with transparency and reliable customer service as of the end of 2015  only manufacturers in the united states or canada may participate in etsy manufacturing and there is no fee for participation 

an etsy seller who would like to work with a manufacturer whether found through the etsy manufacturing marketplace or on her own must apply our responsible seller growth team reviews every application we do not review or approve the manufacturer instead we look to the etsy seller to provide evidence of authorship responsibility and transparency we also ask etsy sellers to work with manufacturers who adhere to our ethical expectations humane working conditions nondiscrimination policies sustainability practices and no child youth or involuntary labor to encourage transparency etsy sellers are required to disclose their use of manufacturers in their etsy shop 

etsy employees 

we too are members of our community whether crafting our policies talking with etsy sellers and etsy buyers in our online forums or building the tools and services underlying our marketplace our employees create genuine and lasting connections in our community etsy employees emphasize building personal relationships with etsy sellers visiting their shops inviting them to our offices for lunch or celebrating with them at inperson events in addition each of our employees including management is expected to perform support rotations to help foster connections with etsy sellers and etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs 

we pride ourselves on our valuesbased work culture we emphasize respect direct communication and fun we focus on maximizing our employees’ professional and personal wellbeing we evaluate performance on traditional business metrics and on adherence to our mission and values 

we believe employee happiness comes from engaging and fulfilling work and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities we invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching skills workshops and training we actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employeetaught classes called “etsy school” covering subjects ranging from screen printing to python programming 

etsy engineering is widely known for its thoughtleading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture our engineering team coined the phrase “code as craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship we believe our engineers have the skills practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings 

as of december 31 2015  we had 819 employees worldwide with 496 in our offices in brooklyn new york of those employees we had 257 in engineering 84 in product 221 in member operations 196 in corporate and 61 in marketing 

we proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company as of december 31 2015  54 of employees identified as female as of december 31 2015 50 of managers and 32 of product engineering and technical operations employees identified as female 

etsyorg 

in january 2015 we formed etsyorg a delaware nonprofit organization to build innovative business education programs that emphasize personal growth and offer the skills and connections that entrepreneurs need to build and run businesses that regenerate communities and the planet in january 2015 we issued 188235  shares of our common stock to etsyorg and we used 300000  of the proceeds of our initial public offering to partially fund etsyorg 

our platform 

our platform is a vehicle for persontoperson commerce both globally and locally our platform includes our marketplace our seller services our technology and our community both online and offline the core of our platform is our marketplace which connects people around the world to make sell and buy unique goods 

the etsy seller experience 

our platform makes it easy for an etsy seller to open an etsy shop and operate her business we help the etsy seller in the following ways 

  

 

 

 

 



 

 

 the etsy buyer experience 

to help etsy buyers discover and purchase items that they love we provide a number of tools including 

  

 

 

 our policies 

members of our community rely on us to be a trusted marketplace our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers etsy buyers wholesale partners and manufacturing partners participating on our platform 

most fundamentally we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade vintage or craft supplies handmade items begin with the imagination and creativity of the etsy seller to conform to our vision of handmade we ask that the etsy seller follow these three principles 

  

 

 

 

we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into etsy sellers’ business practices our policies ask etsy sellers to be transparent 

about themselves their businesses and the goods they sell we also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies for example our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies our trust and safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms 

we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t always go as planned when that happens our online case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes 

our opportunities and strengths 

our opportunities 

we operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce employment consumption and manufacturing we believe that in combination these trends will benefit etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion working for themselves and defining success on their own terms etsy buyers accessing a diverse global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets and increasingly valuesaligned manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in responsible partnership with etsy sellers we also believe that these trends create a strong longterm market opportunity for etsy that will allow us to continue to expand our marketplace globally attract buyers who want something different than a conventional massproduced retail shopping experience deepen the connections within our community and introduce new seller services and tools 

most large retailers today follow a different formula from etsy emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve massproduced goods at the lowestpossible prices we believe however that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style not simply massproduced generic goods finding these goods can be difficult as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces 

etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories including jewelry stationery clothing home goods craft supplies and vintage items euromonitor a consumer market research company estimated that the global online retail market was 991 billion in 2015 up from 483 billion in 2011 representing a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 197 this growth is expected to continue with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market reaching 18 trillion by 2019 implying a 155 cagr from 2015 source euromonitor  2016 passport retailing 

our strengths 

we believe we can benefit from these positive trends by continuing to leverage and expand our platform our platform is one of the largest online marketplaces in the world and we have achieved our scale because of the following key strengths 

our trusted marketplace we have built a trusted marketplace that embodies our valuesbased culture emphasizing respect direct communication and fun our reputation depends upon our etsy sellers their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies we establish trust in our marketplace in a variety of ways for example our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers etsy buyers wholesale partners and manufacturing partners participating on our platform 

transparency is one of our core values and etsys transparency with our community helps to support the trustworthiness of our marketplace for example we publish an annual progress report that details our progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come in 2015 we also released a transparency report which among other things describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on our platform or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights 

we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections between etsy sellers and etsy buyers through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and apps and inperson events highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories and use new tools such as shop videos to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are the cornerstones of our business 

our passionate engaged and loyal etsy sellers and etsy buyers etsy sellers and etsy buyers are passionate engaged and loyal—not only to us but to each other—building a strong community 

  

 

 

 

 

the passion and loyalty demonstrated by etsy sellers and etsy buyers underlies the growth and scale of our platform see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—key factors affecting our performance—growth and retention of active sellers and active buyers” for more information 



  



our innovative technology our widelyrespected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of etsy sellers and etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders languages and devices our team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment we update our code as often as every 20 minutes and as many as 70 times per day with more than 12000 deploys during the year ended december 31 2015  to enhance the performance of our platform we collect and analyze a large volume of data for example we currently collect more than two million discrete metrics which we expect will increase as we grow further in the field of search relevance and purchase recommendations we currently collect and analyze more than 1200 terabytes of data to calculate search and personalization relevance signals in real time to recommend goods to each prospective etsy buyer from a broad inventory of unique goods 

mobile commerce is increasingly important in online retail for example comscore has estimated that since the first quarter of 2013 consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices however spending via mobile devices represented only 16 of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2015 we are a mobilefirst company and have focused on expanding our mobile capabilities in recent years we developed our “sell on etsy” mobile app to help the etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders our mobile website and our “buy on etsy” mobile app for etsy buyers which we developed to keep etsy buyers engaged wherever they are includes search discovery curation personalization and social shopping features optimized for the mobile experience during 2015 we continued to enhance our mobile app for etsy buyers in many ways including adding new deep linking functionality integrating social signup and signin expanding our mobile payment and digital wallet options with apple pay google wallet and others 

for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 60  of our visits and approximately 43  of our gms were generated on a mobile device this is a strong improvement compared with 2014  during which 54  of our visits and 37  of our gms were generated on a mobile device in addition we are focused on continuing to narrow the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms and we saw this metric improve in 2015  

our scaled globallocal marketplace our marketplace is globallocal meaning that we focus on building local etsy communities around the world etsy sellers and etsy buyers in these local communities in turn have global reach and access through our platform in particular we seek to develop local markets in key countries outside the united states where we see both local buyer and seller activity currently etsy sellers and etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages in 2015  298  of our gms involved an etsy seller or etsy buyer outside of the united states we believe our globallocal marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the united states because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country instead the diverse location of etsy sellers and etsy buyers creates the scale and a concentration of etsy sellers and etsy buyers in any given region can give rise to a vibrant local etsy marketplace during 2015 we launched several new features to support our globallocal marketplace including curated “editor’s picks” shopping pages and direct etsy emails to buyers that are locally relevant to a specific region to help etsy 

buyers who prefer to buy locally in australia and the united kingdom we made it easier to find items from their home countries on our marketplace we’re also focused on providing additional local payment options 

our selleraligned business model etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them to succeed and as etsy sellers succeed so do we our selleraligned business model creates network effects the more we invest in our platform the more we enable etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for etsy buyers to find unique goods we call this etsy’s empowerment loop some 76 of etsy sellers consider their etsy shops to be businesses and 90 want to grow their businesses as indicated by our 2014 seller survey we focus on offering seller services that help an etsy seller spend more of her time on her creative passion and less of her time on the administrative aspects of running a business during the year ended december 31 2015  481 of etsy sellers used at least one of our seller services similarly our manufacturing and wholesale programs enable an etsy seller to grow her business on our platform 



our strategy the path ahead 

we have four key strategic priorities 

make etsy an everyday experience the power of human connection is central to the etsy experience we emphasize relationships connecting creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world and we continually strive to make those connections a daily habit for etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

the everyday experience starts with mobile in 2015  approximately 60  of our visits and approximately 43  of our gms were generated on a mobile device 

  

 

 

build local marketplaces globally our vision is global and local in 2015  313 of etsy sellers were located outside the united states and 298  of our gms involved an etsy seller or etsy buyer outside of the united states although we promote crossborder transactions our strategy is to build and deepen local etsy communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of etsy sellers and etsy buyers for example although gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country is a small percentage of our total gms excluding our french marketplace alm this gms grew approximately 50  in 2015 compared with 2014 we plan to continue to invest in local marketing and content and other 

locallyrelevant tools and enhancements around the world to encourage these connections we believe our locallyfocused work will broaden the reach of our global platform 

offer highimpact seller services seller services such as promoted listings direct checkout and shipping labels help an etsy seller spend more time on the pleasures of her craft and less time on the administrative aspects of her business we launched our first seller service in late 2011 and in 2015  seller services represented 1366 million  499  of our revenue a 656  increase over 2014  and 825 million  or 422  of total revenue in 2014  a 927  increase over 2013  according to our 2014 seller survey for every hour that an etsy seller spends making her products she spends another hour doing businessrelated tasks including inventory management shipping customer service marketing and accounting we intend to enhance existing seller services extend their geographic reach and introduce new ones to increase the amount of time an etsy seller can devote to her craft 



  

  

expand the etsy economy we intend to fulfill our mission to reimagine commerce by expanding the impact of our platform by further developing our manufacturing program we believe we are helping etsy sellers who want to grow their businesses connect with skilled partners while helping to revitalize manufacturing in local communities we will also continue to focus on our wholesale offering which we launched in august 2014 so that etsy sellers can sell their products to select retail partners such as land of nod lou  grey macys and whole foods 

we plan to focus on strategic partnerships technological advances and publicprivate endeavors such as our craft entrepreneurship program which we believe will bring the benefit of the etsy economy to more people and more communities craft entrepreneurship is an educational program intended to empower creative people in underserved communities with the resources to start and run an online business with etsy andor elsewhere as of december 31 2015  we’ve partnered with local organizations in 23 cities in australia canada the united states and the united kingdom to provide craft entrepreneurship classes weve committed to expand craft entrepreneurship to a total of 30 cities by june 2016 

competition 

we compete with retailers for the etsy seller an etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform we are able to compete for etsy sellers based on our brand awareness the global scale of our marketplace and the breadth of our online presence the number and engagement of etsy buyers our seller services our seller education resources and tools our policies and fees our mobile apps the strength of our community and our values 

we also compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces we are able to compete for etsy buyers based on the unique goods that etsy sellers list in our marketplace our brand awareness the persontoperson commerce experience our reputation as a trusted marketplace our mobile apps ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform 

intellectual property 

protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success we rely on intellectual property laws primarily including trade secret copyright and trademark laws in the united states and abroad and we use confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property 

while we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property we register domain names trademarks and service marks in the united states and abroad we also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks 

circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the united states or other countries in which we operate in addition the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our ability to compete and our operating results 

government regulation 

as with any company operating on the internet we grapple with a growing number of local national and international laws and regulations these laws are often complex sometimes contradict other laws and are frequently still evolving laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world posing a significant challenge to our global business for example us federal and state laws eu directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected laws of defamation apply online and vary by country the growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply additionally because we operate internationally we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the united states including antimoney laundering anticorruption and export control laws 

emerging growth company status 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 or the “jobs act” we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of 1 the last day of the fiscal year a in 2020 which will follow the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 10 billion or c in which we become a large accelerated filer which means that we have been public for at least 12 months have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter and 2 the date on which we have issued more than 10 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period 

the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and therefore we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below our consolidated financial statements and related notes management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — key factors affecting our performance and the other information in this annual report on form 10k if any of these risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected as a result the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

we have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

we incurred net losses of 541 million  152 million  and 08 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of december 31 2015  we had an accumulated deficit of 864 million  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we hire additional employees increase our marketing efforts expand our operations and continue to invest in the development of our platform including new services and features for our community these efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses in addition our revenue may decline for a number of reasons including those described in these risk factors 

further our revenue growth rate particularly our marketplace revenue may continue to decelerate in the future for a number of reasons including the gradual deceleration of our gms growth rate for further information about the rate of revenue and gms growth see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — revenue you should not rely on growth rates of prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results as well as our key metrics may fluctuate for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control these reasons include those described in these risk factors as well as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and key metrics may cause those results to fall below our own financial projections or the expectations of analysts or investors which could cause the price of our common stock to decline fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems for example analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock we could experience shortterm liquidity issues our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise 

in addition we believe that our quarterly operating results and key metrics may vary in the future and that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful for example our overall historical growth rate may have overshadowed the effect of seasonal variations on our historical operating results these seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time which could also cause our operating results and key metrics to fluctuate you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active and engaged community of etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in attracting and retaining active sellers and active buyers for example our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers seller engagement the number of active buyers buyer engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace we must continue to encourage etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our seller services and encourage etsy buyers to purchase items in our marketplace 

we believe that many new etsy sellers and etsy buyers find etsy by word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers if existing etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform they may stop listing items in our marketplace and may stop referring others to us likewise if existing etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing whether because of a negative experience lack of buyerfriendly features declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by etsy sellers or other factors they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us under these circumstances we may have difficulty attracting new etsy sellers and etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense 

even if we are able to attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers to replace the ones that we lose they may not maintain the same level of activity and the revenue generated from new etsy sellers and etsy buyers may not be as high as the revenue generated from the ones who leave our marketplace if we are unable to retain existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers and attract new etsy sellers and etsy buyers who contribute to an active community our growth prospects could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success if we are unable to maintain them our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could suffer 

we have built a trusted marketplace that embodies our valuesbased culture emphasizing respect direct communication and fun our reputation depends upon our etsy sellers their unique offerings and their adherence to our policies we establish trust in our marketplace in a variety of ways for example our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of etsy sellers etsy buyers wholesale partners and manufacturing partners participating on our platform we strive to give the etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a small business that adheres to certain principles our integrity team uses a combination of machine learning automated systems and communitygenerated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies we also have sophisticated tools to detect fraud and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform we ask our large wholesale retail partners to agree to the etsy wholesale retailer commitments which are a set of guidelines to follow when working with etsy sellers and are intended to foster relationships that lead to mutual success in addition manufacturers who apply to join etsy manufacturing must commit to ethical expectations and to operating a safe and just workplace with transparency and reliable customer service 

transparency is one of our core values and etsys transparency with our community helps to support the trustworthiness of our marketplace for example we publish an annual progress report that details our progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come in 2015 we also released a transparency report which among other things describes the steps we take when items that do not meet our guidelines are listed on our platform or when listed items are alleged to infringe third party rights 

we also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction we deepen connections among members of our community through our direct communication tools seller stories on our website and our inperson events which highlight personal relationships as a key part of the etsy experience for example etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories and use new tools such as shop videos to reach etsy buyers on our platform and on social media we also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t always go as planned when that happens our case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes 

we also encourage our employees to build meaningful connections with other members of our community for example each of our employees including management is expected to perform support rotations to help foster connections with etsy sellers and etsy buyers and to help us better understand their needs 

the trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among the members of our community are the cornerstones of our business many things could undermine these cornerstones such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 if we are unable to maintain a trustworthy marketplace and encourage connections among members of our community then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected 

adherence to our values and our focus on longterm sustainability may negatively influence our short or mediumterm financial performance 

our values are integral to everything we do accordingly we intend to focus on the longterm sustainability of our businessour ecosystem and expanding the etsy economy which is one of our key strategies we may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and our ecosystem and therefore our stockholders over a longer period of time even if those actions do not maximize short or mediumterm financial results however these longerterm benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all for example 

 

 

 

we are a certified b corporation the term “certified b corporation” does not refer to a particular form of legal entity but instead refers to companies that are certified by b lab an independent nonprofit organization as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance accountability and transparency b lab sets the standards for certified b corporation certification and may change those standards over time these standards may not be appropriately tailored to the legal requirements of publiclytraded companies or to the operational requirements of larger companies our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a certified b corporation whether by our choice or by our failure to meet b lab’s certification requirements if that change in status were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by certified b corporations likewise our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported b corporation score declines and that created a perception that we have slipped in our satisfaction of the certified b corporation standards similarly our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with our values 

expanding our community into markets outside of the united states is an important part of our strategy and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed 

our vision is global and local and building local marketplaces globally is one of our key strategies although we have a significant number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers outside of the united states we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the united states and may not execute our strategy successfully operating in markets outside of the united states also requires significant management attention including managing and staffing operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs and adapting our platform to local markets 

despite our execution efforts the nature of the goods that etsy sellers list in our marketplace may not appeal to nonus consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the united states in addition nonus buyers are not as familiar with our marketplace and brand as buyers in the united states and may not perceive us as relevant or trustworthy also visits to our marketplace from etsy buyers outside the united states may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the united states including due to the impact of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies and the fact that a majority of the goods listed on our marketplace are denominated in us dollars our success in markets outside the united states will be linked to our ability to attract local etsy sellers and etsy buyers to our platform if we are not able to expand into markets outside of the united states successfully our growth prospects could be harmed 

competition is also likely to intensify in the international markets where we operate and plan to expand our operations local companies based in markets outside the united states may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on those local markets some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow in international markets more quickly than we will 

continued expansion in markets outside of the united states may also require significant financial investment these investments include marketing to attract and retain new etsy sellers and etsy buyers developing localized services and payment processing functions forming relationships with thirdparty service providers supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the united states and integrating those companies with our operations our investment in markets outside of the united states may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses 

further expansion into markets outside of the united states will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad 

doing business in markets outside of the united states subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders if etsy sellers are not our business could be adversely affected 

if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the united states and cannot manage these risks effectively the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets 

we expect to continue to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new etsy sellers and etsy buyers and retaining existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and broader platform is important to our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers we believe that much of the historical growth in the number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers has originated from wordofmouth referrals and other organic means as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited we intend to continue to invest significant resources in marketing with a particular focus on bringing more etsy buyers to our platform we anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as competition increases and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of these efforts that additional revenue may not offset the expenses we incur 

the marketing efforts we implement may not succeed for a variety of reasons including our inability to execute and implement our plans external factors beyond our control may also impact the success of our marketing initiatives our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing affiliate marketing and display advertising as well as search engine optimization social media usage mobile “push” notifications and email we obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as google bing and yahoo search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user’s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed which can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and therefore reduce the number of visits to our marketplace the growing use of online adblocking software including on mobile devices may also impact the success of our marketing efforts because we may reach a smaller audience and fail to bring more etsy buyers to our platform we also obtain a significant number of visits through email advertising if we are unable to successfully deliver emails to etsy sellers and etsy buyers or if etsy sellers and etsy buyers do not open our emails whether by choice because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons our business could be adversely affected social networking websites such as facebook and pinterest are another important source of visits to our marketplace as online commerce and social networking continue to evolve we must maintain a presence within these networks we may be unable to develop or maintain such a presence 

our payments system depends on thirdparty providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations 

etsy buyers primarily pay for purchases using direct checkout or paypal in the united states and other countries where direct checkout is available etsy buyers can use direct checkout on our platform to pay with credit cards debit cards bank transfers paypal apple pay google wallet and etsy gift cards rather than being directed to a thirdparty payment platform a significant portion of our gms is processed through direct checkout and a portion of our revenue is derived from direct checkout 

we have engaged thirdparty service providers to perform underlying compliance card processing currency exchange identity verification and fraud analysis services if these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate etsy sellers’ ability to receive orders or payment could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed in addition if these providers increase the fees they charge us our operating expenses could increase alternatively if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to etsy sellers some etsy sellers may stop using direct checkout stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether 

the laws and regulations related to payments are complex and subject to change and vary across different jurisdictions in the united states and globally as a result we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our thirdparty service providers to comply could cost us substantial resources could result in liabilities or could force us to stop offering direct checkout as we expand the availability of direct checkout or offer new payment methods to etsy sellers and etsy buyers in the future we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements 

further through our agreement with our thirdparty credit card processor we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements including the payment card industry data security standard which are subject to change we are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply 

our ability to expand our ecosystem is important to the growth of our business 

we spend substantial time and resources creating new offerings in order to add new members to our community grow our ecosystem and open new sales channels for etsy sellers for example in october 2013 we expanded our ecosystem by allowing etsy sellers to apply to work with valuesaligned manufacturers and in september 2015 we announced the preliminary 

launch of etsy manufacturing a marketplace to help etsy sellers find and connect directly with manufacturers to form responsible partnerships   

additionally in august 2014 we added traditional retailers to our ecosystem with the launch of our wholesale offering which allows etsy sellers to sell their products to retailers on our platform 

our efforts to expand our ecosystem could fail for many reasons including lack of acceptance of our offerings by existing or new members of our community our failure to market our offerings effectively defects or errors in our new offerings or negative publicity about us or our new offerings 

diversifying our offerings expanding our ecosystem and growing the etsy economy involve significant risk for example our initiatives may not drive increases in revenue may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do we may be required to invest additional time and resources in the development and training of our existing community particularly our employees who will help implement our expansion efforts if we are unable to costeffectively expand our ecosystem then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed 

we must enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology new service and product introductions and changing customer demands we spend substantial time and resources understanding the needs of etsy sellers and etsy buyers and responding to them for example we enhance our seller services search and discovery functionality and the member experience on a regular basis we also focus on providing additional seller services and tools to help etsy sellers manage and scale their businesses for example in 2015 we introduced calculated shipping which helps automate the most timeconsuming aspects of determining shipping costs for etsy sellers in addition we enhanced direct checkout by integrating paypal payments which enables etsy sellers to accept paypal on our platform and reach more etsy buyers offering highimpact seller services is one of our key strategies 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers may not be satisfied with our enhancements or new offerings or may perceive that these offerings do not respond to their needs in addition developing new services and features is complex and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience as a result the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated release dates or they may be introduced as pilot programs which may not be continued for various reasons our new offerings also may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do 

if we do not continue to costeffectively develop new offerings that satisfy etsy sellers and etsy buyers then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed in addition new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue from the new offerings may not be enough to offset the cost of developing them 

if the mobile solutions available to etsy sellers and etsy buyers are not effective the use of our platform could decline 

making etsy an everyday experience is one of our key strategies and starts with mobile visits and purchases made on mobile devices by consumers including etsy buyers have increased significantly in recent years the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing visits to our marketplace on mobile devices may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through personal computers which could result in less revenue for us etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices etsy sellers’ ability to manage and grow their businesses may be harmed and consequently our business may suffer further although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both etsy sellers and etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device we depend on etsy sellers and etsy buyers downloading our mobile apps to provide them the optimal mobile experience 

as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them in addition supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources 

the success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control such as 

 

 

 

 if etsy sellers and etsy buyers encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices or if they choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends 

macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business if general economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or other markets where we operate consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods available in our marketplace may be reduced this would cause sales in our marketplace to decline and adversely impact our business conversely if recent trends supporting selfemployment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse the number of etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplace could decline in addition we believe that currency exchange rates impact our gms with a strong us dollar dampening demand for goods denominated in us dollars from buyers outside the united states in 2015  approximately 90  of our gms was denominated in us dollars 

even without changes in economic conditions the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer preferences consumer preferences can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures 

if demand for the goods that etsy sellers offer in our marketplace declines our business would be harmed trends in sociallyconscious consumerism and buying locally could also shift or slow to the detriment of our business our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue 

we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 

our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future to be successful we need to attract and retain both etsy sellers and etsy buyers as a result we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors 

we compete with retailers for etsy sellers in addition to listing her goods for sale on etsy an etsy seller can list her goods with other online retailers such as amazon ebay or alibaba or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces she may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers including large national retailers who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise we also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses enabling an etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform such as square intuit and shopify 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy sellers based on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition we compete with retailers for the attention of the etsy buyer an etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer whether large marketplaces such as amazon ebay or alibaba or national retail chains such as pottery barn or target or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces many of these competitors offer lowcost or free shipping fast shipping times favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for etsy sellers to match 

we compete to attract engage and retain etsy buyers based on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater resources better name recognition or more customers than we do 

they may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do further our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services causing etsy sellers and etsy buyers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services additionally we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship 

local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the united states may also have a better understanding of local customs providing them a competitive advantage for example in certain markets outside the united states we compete with smaller but similar local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets 

if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors’ actions our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to etsy buyers 

a small portion of etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform for example etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased that the items received were not as represented by an etsy seller or that an etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions 

although our case system provides a way for etsy sellers and etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes negative publicity and sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers or damage our reputation a perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could have similar results in some situations we may choose to reimburse etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements 

anything that prevents the timely processing of orders or delivery of goods to etsy buyers could harm etsy sellers service interruptions and delivery delays may be caused by events that are beyond the control of etsy sellers such as interruptions in order or payment processing transportation disruptions natural disasters inclement weather terrorism public health crises or 

political unrest disruptions in the operations of a substantial number of etsy sellers could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of etsy buyers which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use unethical business practices 

our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices by etsy sellers or other members of our community our policies promote legal and ethical business practices such as encouraging etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions however we do not control etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies if members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed 

failure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business 

although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our marketplace those measures may not always be effective 

for example etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data under current credit card practices we could be held liable for orders placed through direct checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction although we attempt to detect or challenge fraudulent transactions we may not be able to do so effectively as a result our business could be adversely affected we could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace 

negative publicity and sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members of our community or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and support for etsy sellers and etsy buyers are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers and damage our reputation 

if sensitive information about members of our community is misused or disclosed or if we or our thirdparty providers are subject to cyber attacks members of our community may curtail use of our platform we may be exposed to liability and our reputation could suffer 

we collect transmit and store personal and financial information provided by members of our community such as names email addresses the details of transactions and credit card and other financial information some of our thirdparty service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers also regularly have access to some confidential and sensitive data in an effort to protect sensitive information we rely on a variety of security measures including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties however advances in computer capabilities increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive information the preventive measures we take to address these risks are costly and may become more costly in the future 

like all online services our platform is vulnerable to power outages telecommunications failures and catastrophic events as well as computer viruses breakins phishing attacks denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable or other sensitive information cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property as we gain greater public visibility we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks advances in computer capabilities new technological discoveries or other developments may result in cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect we and our thirdparty service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyber attacks moreover techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our thirdparty service providers security breaches can also occur as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our thirdparty service providers 

we and our thirdparty service providers regularly experience cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our thirdparty service providers’ services if we or our thirdparty service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up an account with us existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers may stop listing new items for sale decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether we could also face potential liability costly remediation efforts and litigation which may not be adequately covered by insurance any of these results could harm our growth prospects our business and our reputation 

our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform 

the reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers as the number of etsy sellers and etsy buyers volume of traffic number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow the operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex and we could experience operational failures if we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability 

we also depend on the development and maintenance of the internet and mobile infrastructure this includes maintenance of reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed data capacity and security as well as timely development of complementary products 

thirdparty providers host much of our technology infrastructure any disruption in their services or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide if we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully then our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers could be adversely affected which could harm our growth prospects and our business 

our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success 

we strive to attract retain and motivate employees from our office administrators to our management team who share our dedication to our community and our mission as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the employees we need to maintain our competitive position 

some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include 

 

 

 

 

 

 our ability to attract retain and motivate employees including our management team is important to our success in general our employees including our management team work for us on an atwill basis the unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees such as our ceo or cfo could adversely affect our business other companies including our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms 

filling engineering product management and other technical positions in the new york city area is particularly challenging especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture qualified individuals are limited and in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract develop and motivate them even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us in addition job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment if the perceived value of our stock awards declines it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees if we are not able to maintain our engineering culture and broader company culture then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed 

the growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure 

we have experienced rapid growth in our business such as in headcount the number of etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have etsy sellers and etsy buyers and we plan to continue to grow in the future both in the united states 

and abroad for example our headcount has grown from 251 employees on december 31 2011 to   819  employees on december 31 2015  the growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure as we continue to grow our operating expenses will increase if we do not manage our growth effectively the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed 

continued growth could also pose other challenges such as the need to develop and improve our operational financial and management controls and to enhance our reporting systems and procedures for example over the past several years we have been implementing and refining an enterprise resource planning or erp system to enhance a variety of important functions such as invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable foreign currency translation financial consolidation and internal and external financial and management reporting matters erp system implementations are complex longterm projects that involve substantial expenditures to fully realize the benefits of our erp system we have made and may continue to make changes to our business and financial processes our business may be harmed if our erp system does not function as expected or does not result in the expected benefits 

we may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses which may divert management’s attention andor prove to be unsuccessful 

we have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future for example in april 2014 we acquired jarvis labs inc dba grand st and in june 2014 we acquired incubart sas dba a little market acquisitions may divert management’s time and focus from operating our business acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash incur debt or other liabilities amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur writeoffs of goodwill or other assets in addition integrating an acquired business or technology is risky completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with 

 

 

 

 

 

 moreover we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect or in the time frame we expect we also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition which could cause dilution to our stockholders finally acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts investors or the members of our community 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks 

etsy sellers and etsy buyers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade access to our platform or increase the cost of such access mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on the ability to download and use our mobile apps 

internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform in 2015 rules approved by the federal communications commission went into effect that prohibit internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain “fast traffic” lanes however the rules are subject to pending legal challenges and if they are overturned our business could be adversely impacted outside of the united states government regulation of the internet including the idea of network neutrality may be developing or nonexistent as a result we could face discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede both our and etsy sellers’ growth prospects increase our costs and harm our business 

our business is subject to a large number of us and nonus laws many of which are evolving 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and around the world including those relating to traditional businesses such as employment laws and taxation and newer laws and regulations focused on the internet and online commerce such as payment systems privacy antispam data protection electronic contracts intellectual property and consumer protection these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort additionally it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by the internet or online commerce 

for example laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions federal state and nonus governmental authorities as well as courts interpreting the laws continue to evaluate the privacy implications of the use of thirdparty “cookies” “web beacons” and other methods of online tracking the united states the european union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools 

some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented or have announced plans to implement ways to block tracking technologies which if widely adopted could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of etsy buyers increase our costs and limit our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers on costeffective terms as a result our business could be adversely affected 

in some cases nonus privacy data protection consumer protection ecommerce and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the united states and are enforced aggressively 

for example the european union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations and provided for more onerous penalties under such laws than the united states consequently the expansion of our operations internationally may require changes to the ways we display collect and use consumer information 

existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal state or nonus governments could impede the growth or use of the internet or online commerce it is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform if we are restricted from operating in one or more countries our ability to attract and retain etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate 

we strive to comply with all applicable laws but they may conflict with each other and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction despite our efforts we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future if we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties and we may be forced to change the way we operate that could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services which could negatively affect our business 

additionally if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business 

we may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit infringing or illegal 

although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by etsy sellers we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights we have intellectual property complaint and takedown procedures in place to address these communications and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace we follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine the appropriate action which may include removal of the item from our marketplace and in certain cases closing the shops of etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies 

our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability in particular we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by etsy sellers on our platform especially outside the united states where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states under current us copyright law and the communications decency act we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from liability for content posted on our platform by etsy sellers and etsy buyers however trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions and liability for these forms of intellectual property is often determined by court decisions these safe harbors and court rulings 

may change unfavorably in that event we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of etsy sellers 

regardless of the validity of any claims made against us we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them if a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by etsy sellers on our platform we could face regulatory civil or criminal penalties successful claims by thirdparty rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items these types of claims could force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our platform less userfriendly moreover public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace even if factually incorrect could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

we may be subject to intellectual property claims which are extremely costly to defend could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we periodically receive communications that claim we have infringed misappropriated or misused others’ intellectual property rights to the extent we gain greater public recognition we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims thirdparties may have intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and prevent us from expanding our offerings any intellectual property claim against us with or without merit could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters 

in addition some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents many potential litigants including some of our competitors and patent holding companies have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights we also might be required to seek a license for thirdparty intellectual property even if a license is available we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms which would increase our operating expenses we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant time and expense if we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively any of these results could harm our business 

we may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming 

in addition to intellectual property claims we may become involved in other litigation matters including class action lawsuits for example as described further in note 14 — commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants under certain circumstances we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors officers and underwriters in connection with the litigation described in this annual report on form 10k and in connection with any future lawsuits any lawsuit to which we are a party with or without merit may result in an unfavorable judgment we also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices any of these results could adversely affect our business in addition defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 

our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark and to a lesser extent patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective we generally do not elect to register our copyrights or the majority of our trademarks relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property which may not be sufficient in addition our copyrights and trademarks whether or not registered and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged while we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property to the extent we do seek patent protection any us or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies 

in addition we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property even if we do detect violations we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights any enforcement efforts we undertake including litigation could be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert our management’s attention in addition our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable if we are unable to costeffectively protect our intellectual property rights then our business could be harmed 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors 

the software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released we rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment” meaning that we typically release software code many times per day this practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of our community members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business 

we are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software 

the software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses in addition we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses and we anticipate doing so in the future the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace under certain open source licenses we could be required to publicly release the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software in addition use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and our etsy sellers and etsy buyers may be subject to sales and other taxes 

the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax or vat provincial taxes goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to businesses like ours and to etsy sellers and etsy buyers is a complex and evolving issue for example as of january 1 2015 the european union imposed an obligation on us to collect and remit vat on sales of automaticallydownloaded digital items and we have implemented such collection and remittance procedures significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and could change in many cases the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business or to etsy sellers’ businesses one or more states the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting recordkeeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce for example the us congress is currently considering legislation which would grant states the authority to require online merchants to collect sales tax on online sales at the time a transaction is completed new taxes could also require us or etsy sellers to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes if such obligations were imposed the additional costs associated with tax collection remittance and audit requirements could make selling in our marketplace less attractive and more costly for etsy sellers which could adversely affect our business 

we may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and in numerous other jurisdictions we record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits at any one time multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions as a result we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated further our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax 

laws changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business 

in january 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states our new corporate structure changed how we use our intellectual property and implemented certain intercompany arrangements we believe this may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate over the long term and other operational efficiencies however the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure moreover these tax laws are subject to change tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences if our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected 

the terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

we do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility however our credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies if we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments moreover any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity 

we may need additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders borrowing funds would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit our operations it is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

if our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business 

our insurance policies cover a number of risks and potential liabilities such as general liability property coverage errors and omissions liability employment liability business interruptions data breaches crime product liability and directors’ and officers’ liability for certain types of business risk we may not be able to or may choose not to acquire insurance in addition we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums andor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain additionally if any of our insurers becomes insolvent it would be unable to pay any claims that we make 

we are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from the reporting requirements applicable to other public companies for example we intend to take advantage of the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments it is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions if so there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of 1 the last day of the fiscal year a in 2020 which will follow the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 10 billion or c in which we become a large accelerated filer which means that we have been a public company for at least 12 months have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter and 2 the date on which we have issued more than 10 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period 

operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention in addition our management team has limited experience managing a public company 

as a public company we incur substantial legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission or the sec the rules and regulations of nasdaq also apply to us as part of these requirements we have established and maintained effective disclosure and financial controls and made changes to our corporate governance practices we expect that continued compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming 

most of our management and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings in addition our management and other personnel divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company in particular we expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge 

our management will not be required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until december 31 2016 if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report for the year ended december 31 2016 we will be required to provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting in preparation of being able to provide such a report we continue to make progress in documenting assessing and testing our internal control over financial reporting when we are no longer an emerging growth company our management report on internal control over financial reporting will need to be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal control over financial reporting while we are an emerging growth company 

as described in part ii item 9a controls and procedures we previously identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which we remediated as of december 31 2015 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not detect errors on a timely basis in addition material weaknesses could harm our operating results cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations or nasdaq listing requirements on a timely basis adversely affect our reputation cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements further if there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of 

our internal controls investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline we could become subject to investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected 

our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters public health crises political crises or other unexpected events 

natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions public health crises political crises such as terrorist attacks war and other political instability or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our service providers for example when hurricane sandy struck new york in october 2012 although our data centers were unaffected our headquarters in brooklyn was closed for five days and we experienced a heavy volume of support requests from etsy sellers and etsy buyers which required us to devote additional resources to handle those requests events of this type could also impact etsy sellers’ ability to continue producing goods for sale in our marketplace in addition such events could negatively impact consumer spending in the affected regions if any of these events occurs our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation 

the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for example since shares of our common stock were sold in our ipo in april 2015 our common stocks daily closing price on nasdaq has ranged from a low of 636 to a high of 3000 through february 26 2016 the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons many of which are beyond our control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business results of operations or financial condition stock prices of many technology companies have historically been highly volatile some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation for example as described further in note 14 — commitments and contingencies — legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements three purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed naming etsy and certain of our officers andor directors as defendants we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility or declines in our stock price any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

if analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our common stock would likely decline if few analysts cover us demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility as a result stockholders will not receive dividends or other distributions and may only receive a return on their investment if the trading price of our common stock increases 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we cannot predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing price of our common stock 

all of our executive officers and directors and certain major holders of our capital stock entered into lockup agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering that restrict these stockholders’ ability to transfer a portion of their shares of our common stock for a period of 360 days following our initial public offering approximately 219 million shares are still subject to lockup agreements and will become eligible for sale on april 10 2016 

these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the lockup agreements described above sales of stock by these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

additionally certain holders of shares of our common stock have registration rights registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for shares 

held by our affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act sales of securities by any of these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we may issue additional common stock convertible securities or other equity in the future we also issue common stock to our employees directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline new investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders 

we have broad discretion in the use of our cash resources and may not use them effectively 

we currently intend to use our cash resources for working capital and general corporate purposes including continued investments in the growth of our business our management has broad discretion in the allocation and use of our cash resources the failure by our management to allocate or use these funds effectively could harm our business pending their use we may invest these funds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value our ultimate use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering may vary substantially from their original intended use 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management among other things these provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 these provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock antitakeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion particularly information with respect to our outlook our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in the “risk factors” section 

overview 

we operate a marketplace where people around the world connect both online and offline to make sell and buy unique goods as of december 31 2015  through our innovative technologybased platform we connected a community of 16 million  active etsy sellers and 240 million  active etsy buyers in nearly every country in the world 

our business model is based on shared success we make money when etsy sellers make money our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses in 2015  etsy sellers generated gms of 24 billion  of which approximately 43  came from purchases made on mobile devices we are a global company and 298  of our 2015 gms came from an etsy seller or an etsy buyer outside of the united states 

our business has grown in significant ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in 2015  etsy sellers generated gms of 24 billion  up 236  over 2014  and in 2014  etsy sellers generated gms of 19 billion  up 433  over 2013  in 2015  we generated revenue of 2735 million  up 398  over 2014  and in 2014  we generated 

revenue of 1956 million  up 564  over 2013  in 2015  we generated a net loss of 541 million  and adjusted ebitda of 310 million  compared to a net loss of 152 million  and adjusted ebitda of 231 million  in 2014  in 2014  we generated a net loss of 152 million  and adjusted ebitda of 231 million  compared to a net loss of 08 million  and adjusted ebitda of 169 million  in 2013  see “—nongaap financial measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

key operating and financial metrics 

we collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our ecosystem allocate our resources such as capital time and technology investments and assess the performance of our business in addition to revenue net loss income and other results under gaap the key operating and financial metrics we use are 



gms 

gross merchandise sales or gms is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with cancelled transactions gms does not represent revenue earned by us gms relates only to marketplace activity and does not reflect seller services activity however because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace we believe that gms is an indicator of the success of etsy sellers the satisfaction of etsy buyers the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda represents our net loss before interest expense net benefit provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted to eliminate stockbased compensation expense net unrealized loss gain on warrant and other liabilities foreign exchange loss gain other nonoperating expense net acquisitionrelated expenses and our contributions to etsyorg we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans and assess the health of our ecosystem as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more resources in our community we also believe that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of noncash items and certain variable charges see “ — nongaap financial measures” below for information regarding the limitations of using adjusted ebitda as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

active sellers 

an active seller is an etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months charges include transaction fees listing fees and fees for direct checkout promoted listings shipping labels and wholesale enrollment an etsy seller is someone who has created an account and has listed an item in our marketplace an etsy seller is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy seller accounts we succeed when etsy sellers succeed so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand the reach of our platform the potential for growth in gms and revenue and the health of our ecosystem 

active buyers 

an active buyer is an etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months an etsy buyer is someone who has created an account in our marketplace an etsy buyer is identified by a unique email address a single person can have multiple etsy buyer accounts we succeed when etsy buyers order items from etsy sellers so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in gms and revenue the reach of our platform awareness of our brand the engagement and loyalty of etsy buyers and the health of our ecosystem 

mobile visits 

a visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app a visit ends after 30 minutes of activity a mobile visit is a visit that occurs on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone etsy sellers are increasingly using mobile devices to manage their listings and track their business performance on our platform in addition etsy buyers increasingly use mobile devices to search browse and purchase items on our platform we view percent mobile visits as a key indicator of the level of engagement of etsy sellers and etsy buyers on our mobile website and mobile apps and of our ability to sustain gms and revenue 

mobile gms 

mobile gms is gms that occurs on a mobile device such as a tablet or a smartphone mobile gms excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop we believe that mobile gms indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

international gms 

international gms is gms from transactions where either the billing address for the etsy seller or the shipping address for the etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the united states we believe that international gms shows the level of engagement of our community outside the united states and demonstrates our ability to grow gms and revenue 

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted ebitda 

in this annual report on form 10k we provide adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure that represents our net loss before interest expense net benefit provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted to eliminate stockbased compensation expense net unrealized loss gain on warrant and other liabilities foreign exchange loss gain other nonoperating expense net contributions to etsyorg and acquisitionrelated expenses below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

we have included adjusted ebitda because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform 

we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net loss and our other gaap results 

adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net loss and our other gaap results 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated 

  



key factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed below and in the section titled “risk factors” 

growth and retention of active sellers and active buyers 

our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active sellers and active buyers our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers seller engagement the number of active buyers buyer engagement and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace as of december 31 2015  our marketplace had grown to 16 million  active sellers and 240 million  active buyers up from 14 million  active sellers and 198 million  active buyers as of december 31 2014  failure to effectively attract and retain new active sellers and active buyers to reengage inactive sellers and inactive buyers and to engage active sellers and active buyers on a costeffective basis would adversely affect our revenue growth operating results and the overall health of our ecosystem 

to analyze our retention rates we measure repeat activity by etsy sellers and etsy buyers 

cohort of 2011 and 2012 active sellers 

we refer to active sellers as of december 31 2011 as “2011 active sellers” thirtytwo percent of 2011 active sellers remained active sellers through their fourth year on the platform as of december 31 2014 the average annual gms per 2011 active seller in 2014 was over five times higher than in 2011 

we refer to active sellers as of december 31 2012 as “2012 active sellers” thirtytwo percent of 2012 active sellers remained active sellers through their fourth year on the platform as of december 31 2015  the average annual gms per 2012 active seller in 2015  was over four times higher than in 2012 

cohort of 2011 and 2012 active buyers 

we refer to active buyers as of december 31 2011 as “2011 active buyers” fortyfive percent of 2011 active buyers remained active buyers through their fourth year on the platform as of december 31 2014 the average annual gms per 2011 active buyer in 2014 was 89 higher than in 2011 

we refer to active buyers as of december 31 2012 as “2012 active buyers” fortythree percent of 2012 active buyers remained active buyers through their fourth year on the platform as of december 31 2015  the average annual gms per 2012 active buyer in 2015  was 89 higher than in 2012 

highimpact seller services growth 

our business model is based on shared success we make money when etsy sellers make money for that reason we provide services to an etsy seller to help her start and grow her shop as of december 31 2015  481 of active sellers used one or more of our seller services compared to 461 of active sellers as of december 31 2014 for december 31 2015 this included 167 of active sellers using promoted listings 402 of active sellers using direct checkout and 239 of active sellers in the united states and canada using shipping labels we expect seller services revenue related our existing offerings to continue to grow in 2016 driven by increased adoption and product enhancements additionally we expect to see moderate contributions to revenue related to new product launches and types of seller services our effectiveness in increasing the uptake of our seller services enhancing existing seller services and extending their geographic reach and introducing new seller services will directly impact the success of etsy sellers our revenue growth and our operating results 

international growth 

our growth will depend in part on international etsy sellers and international etsy buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community international gms was 298  of gms in 2015 compared to 309  in 2014  we expect our percent international gms to remain stable in 2016 assuming that currency remains stable compared to average levels in december 2015 we continue to believe that we can grow international gms over time to represent 50 of our total gms etsy sellers and etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages although we promote crossborder transactions our strategy is to build and deepen local etsy communities around the world each with its own ecosystem of etsy sellers and etsy buyers for example although gms generated between a nonus buyer and a nonus seller both in the same country is a small percentage of our total gms excluding our french marketplace alm this gms grew approximately 50  in 2015 compared with 2014 to meet our goals we plan to invest in local marketing and other locallyrelevant tools and enhancements around the world to encourage these connections an inability to develop these etsy 

communities or to otherwise grow our business outside the united states on a costeffective basis could adversely affect our gms revenue and our operating results 

mobile growth 

we believe continued enhancement of the mobile features of our platform will be critical to attracting and retaining etsy sellers and etsy buyers and maintaining the vibrancy of our marketplace the success of this effort will be increasingly important as shopping on mobile devices displaces shopping on desktops and as etsy sellers increasingly seek to run their shops via mobile devices 

we launched our buy on etsy mobile app in 2011 and since then have expanded our mobile offerings for both etsy sellers and etsy buyers our “sell on etsy” mobile app which we launched in april 2014 is designed to help an etsy seller operate her shop manage orders and access resources our etsy buyer apps and mobile web experience include features designed to keep etsy buyers engaged and offer an improved shopping experience as of december 31 2015  our mobile apps have been downloaded 318 million times compared to 218 million times as of december 31 2014  and mobile visits represented 60  of total visits in 2015  compared to 54  of total visits in 2014  in addition in the same period mobile gms was 43  of total gms we believe that we will continue to see the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms narrow in 2016 if we are unable to continue to engage etsy sellers and etsy buyers through our mobile offerings then our gms and revenue growth and our operating results could be adversely affected 

investment in marketing 

to date we have grown largely due to strong brand awareness and wordofmouth referrals with the vast majority of our visits coming from direct and organic channels toward the end of 2014  we began increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts which involved business changes and reorganizations that moved certain teams previously focused on productrelated projects into marketing in 2014  we spent 397 million  on marketing expenses or 203  of revenue up 1222  over 2013  in 2015  we spent 668 million  on marketing expenses or 244  of revenue up 684  over 2014  in the upcoming year we expect marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue our growth will depend in part on our continued ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing etsy sellers and etsy buyers and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through revenue growth

for the year ended december 31 2015  international gms decreased as a percentage of total gms to 298  from 309  for the year ended december 31 2014  we believe that the impact of currency exchange rates contributed to the yearoveryear decline in percent international gms for the reasons described below 

in the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 10  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and as a result was impacted by currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2015  would have been 252  or approximately 16  percentage points higher than the reported 236  growth in addition we believe weaker local currencies in key international markets continued to dampen the demand for us dollardenominated goods during the year ended december 31 2015  impacting both gms growth and percent international gms in light of these factors we estimate that the impact of currency translation on goods not listed in us dollars and the impact of currency exchange rates on international buyer behavior reduced our yearoveryear gms growth rate by approximately two to four percentage points for the year ended december 31 2015  

revenue increased  779 million  or 398  to  2735 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  of which 499  consisted of seller services revenue and 485  consisted of marketplace revenue

for income taxes was impacted by the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates the amount of nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and the unrealized loss on our warrant liability

quarterly results of operations 

the following tables show selected unaudited quarterly results of operations and other operational and nongaap financial data for the eight quarters ended december 31 2015  as well as the percentage that each line item in the following results of operations data represents of revenue the results of operations data for each of these quarters have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and includes all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of our results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our quarterly results of operations and operational and nongaap financial data will vary in the future these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future quarter or year 

  





  



  

 

the following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda for each of the periods indicated in thousands 

  



seasonality 

etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more seller services during the fourthquarter holiday shopping season this has resulted in increased revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year for example revenue in the first quarter of 2015  decreased slightly when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014  we expect this seasonality to continue in future years our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year our operating loss income has also been affected by these historical trends because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term as our growth rates begin to moderate the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced 

our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quartertoquarter for all periods presented above other than the first quarter of 2015  corresponding to our gms performance in the same periods we cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue we believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare yearoveryear results than sequential quarteroverquarter results 

our business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers economic conditions and competitive pressures can significantly impact both positively and negatively the level of demand by etsy sellers and etsy buyers on our platform consequently the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following tables show our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and working capital as of the dates indicated 

  



as of december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds were held for working capital purposes and to invest in the buildout of our new brooklyn new york headquarters and other capital expenditures related to new office spaces globally to support the growth in our business and operations through december 31 2015 we have invested approximately 110 million into the new brooklyn new york headquarters and we intend to invest up to an additional 400 million through the middle of 2016 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect we may seek to borrow funds under our credit agreement or raise additional funds at any time through equity equitylinked or debt financing arrangements our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those described in  — key factors affecting our performance above and the risk factors section of this annual report on form 10k we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms or at all 

sources of liquidity 

prior to our initial public offering or ipo we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations and through nonregistered sales of preferred stock and common stock since inception and prior to the completion of our ipo we have raised a total of 1316 million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock including proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of costs and expenses associated with such financings

we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition income taxes website development costs and internaluse software purchase price allocations for business combinations valuation of goodwill and intangible assets leases and stockbased compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we operate a platform for thirdparty sellers our business model is based on shared success we make money when etsy sellers make money and we offer services to help etsy sellers be more successful we do not compete with etsy sellers hold inventory or sell goods our revenue is diversified generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses our revenue consists of marketplace revenue seller services revenue and other revenue our revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds marketplace revenue includes the fee an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an etsy seller pays for each item she lists seller services revenue includes fees an etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via promoted listings payment processing via direct checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via shipping labels we deduct our cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees other revenue includes the fees we receive from a thirdparty payment processor and derecognized funds we receive from a thirdparty for unused etsy gift cards 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service has been provided to the etsy seller 3 the collection of fees is reasonably assured and 4 the amount of fees to be paid by the etsy seller is fixed or determinable we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we are the primary obligor in a transaction have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers based on our evaluation of these factors revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction 

marketplace revenue marketplace revenue consists of the 35 fee that an etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform exclusive of shipping fees charged marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of 020 per item that she lists in our marketplace revenue from completed wholesale transactions is included in marketplace revenue transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made listing fees are recognized ratably over a fourmonth listing period unless the item is sold or the seller relists it at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized 

seller services revenue seller services revenue consists of fees an etsy seller pays us for the seller services she uses including promoted listings direct checkout and shipping labels

platform we recognize shipping label revenue when an etsy seller purchases a shipping label we recognize shipping label revenue on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services 

other revenue other revenue includes the fees we receive from a thirdparty payment processor which are recognized as the transactions are processed by the thirdparty payment processor and derecognized funds we receive from a third party for unused etsy gift cards which are recognized when the third party approves the release of these funds 

website development and internaluse software 

we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended we also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset typically three years 

we periodically review these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed placed in service removed from service or replaced by other internallydeveloped or thirdparty software if an asset is not expected to provide any future benefit the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed 

costs related to the design or maintenance of software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets 

we have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future the results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash equity or a combination of the two in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies estimates of future revenues and cash flows discount rates and selection of comparable companies 

when we issue stockbased or cash awards to an acquired company’s stockholders we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for postacquisition services the evaluation includes among other things whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s stockholder beyond the acquisition date if continued employment is required for vesting the awards are treated as compensation for postacquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period 

we carry intangible assets at cost and we amortize them on a straightline basis which approximates the pattern of the benefits derived over their estimated useful lives typically three to five years when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment 

goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter as well as when events indicate that the carrying amount of this asset may exceed its fair value the assessment is performed at the reporting unit level using the twostep goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value goodwill is not impaired if the book value exceeds the fair value the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of the impairment the accounting guidance also allows for a simplified approach to testing for impairment in 

which a company can assess certain qualitative factors referred to as “step zero” to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if that is the case the entity must perform the quantitative analysis 

no impairment of goodwill was recorded at december 31 2014 or 2015 

leases 

we lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under noncancelable lease agreements the leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases for operating leases rent is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease period for capital leases we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability 

we consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newlyleased office space to determine if we are considered to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period if we determine that we are the owner of the construction project we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability “buildtosuit accounting” upon occupancy for buildtosuit leases we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the saleleaseback accounting guidance if the lease meets the saleleaseback criteria we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease if upon completion of construction the project does not meet the “saleleaseback” criteria the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes 

income taxes 

we account for income tax benefit provision based on loss income before income taxes and we use the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement we have an unrecognized tax benefit of 04 million  and 222 million  at december 31 2014 and 2015 respectively 

we recognize interest and penalties if any associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 

stockbased compensation 

stock options and restricted stock units rsus are awarded to employees members of our board of directors and nonemployee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date stock options generally vest over a fouryear period with 25 of the shares underlying the options vesting on the date that is 12 months after the vesting commencement date and thereafter 148th of the shares vesting each month subject to continued service with us through each vesting date rsus generally vest 25 after the first year following the vesting commencement date which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12quarter period contingent on continued employment with us on each vesting date 

stockbased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using a blackscholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straightline basis the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq on the grant date we expect to continue to grant stock options and rsus in the future and to the extent that we do our stockbased compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 

we account for stockbased compensation arrangements with nonemployees using a fair value approach the fair value of these options is measured using the blackscholes optionpricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods other than the expected life which is assumed to be the contractual life of the option the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 

we account for stockbased compensation arrangements in restricted shares subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash as liabilityclassified stock awards these awards are remeasured at each reporting period with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards unless the put option is exercised the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option 

key assumptions 

our blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

  

 

 

 

 

 in determining the fair value of stock options granted the following weighted average assumptions were used in the blackscholes optionpricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated 

  



recent accounting pronouncements 

under the jobs act we meet the definition of an emerging growth company we have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section 107b of the jobs act 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance the new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 among other things the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related disclosures in certain circumstances the new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 

in april 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard under which customers will apply the same criteria as vendors to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license or is solely a service contract the new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 we have evaluated the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and do not believe the impact to be material 

in august 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update to address the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements the guidance affirms our treatment of such costs which is to defer and present the debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the costs over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement the new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 

in september 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead an acquirer will recognize a measurementperiod adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment the new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 

in november 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires a reporting entity to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a taxpaying component of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected the new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period we made the decision to adopt this guidance early and have applied it retroactively in the current fiscal period the adoption of this guidance has impacted the current and noncurrent deferred tax asset and liability balances for the current and prior fiscal years on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of this retroactive application 29 million previously included in deferred tax assets — current was reclassified to offset deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for 2014 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have operations both within the united states and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below 

interest rate sensitivity 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2015  were held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds the fair value of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the shortterm nature of these instruments as of december 31 2015  no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility any future borrowings incurred under the credit facility would accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence as 

described above a 10 increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense 

currency risk 

approximately 90  of our gms is denominated in us dollars and therefore the resulting revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however in the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 10  of gms was from goods that were not listed in us dollars and as a result was impacted by currency exchange fluctuations on a currencyneutral basis gms growth for the year ended december 31 2015  would have been 252  or approximately 16  percentage points higher than the reported 236  growth in addition we believe weaker local currencies in key international markets continued to dampen the demand for us dollardenominated goods during the year ended december 31 2015  impacting both gms growth and percent international gms in light of these factors we estimate that the impact of currency translation on goods not listed in us dollars and the impact of currency exchange rates on international buyer behavior reduced our yearoveryear gms growth rate by approximately two to four percentage points for the year ended december 31 2015  

our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates particularly changes in the pound sterling and euro fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 

on january 1 2015 we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the united states which resulted in a us dollardenominated intercompany debt on a eurodenominated ledger that may be subject to continued currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in an increase or decrease to currency exchange loss gain of 248 million

management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting 

this annual report on form 10k does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the sec for newly public companies 

previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 

we previously identified and disclosed in our registration statement on form s1 for the period ended december 31 2014 as well as in our quarterly reports on form 10q for each interim period in fiscal year 2015 material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the following 

 the impact of these material weaknesses resulted in the revision of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2013 for the three months ended march 31 2013 the three and six months ended june 30 2013 the three and nine months ended september 30 2013 the three months ended december 31 2013 and the three months ended september 30 2014 the impacts of these material weaknesses also resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march 31 2014 the three and six months ended june 30 2014 and the nine months ended september 30 2014 

remediation efforts to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses 

our management with oversight from our audit committee has implemented the following remediation steps to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses and to improve our internal control over financial reporting 

 101 

during the quarter ended september 30 2015 we substantially completed the assessment of the design of existing controls and implemented new controls as needed to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses however as we had yet to complete the testing and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of controls the previously disclosed material weaknesses remained unremediated as of the end of the third quarter 

for the quarter ended december 31 2015 we completed the testing and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls and based on the results of our testing the controls were determined to be designed and operating effectively as of december 31 2015 accordingly we concluded the previously reported material weaknesses have been remediated as of december 31 2015 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified during the fourth  quarter of 2015 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on controls 

our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives our management recognizes that any control system no matter how well designed and operated is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met similarly an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected
